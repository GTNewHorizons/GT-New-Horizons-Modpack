# Quest.0 - §d§3§2§1§lYour first night
gtnh.quest0.name=§d§3§2§1§lВаша первая ночь
gtnh.quest0.desc=Ваша первая задача - найти еду и ночлег. Ночи будут жестокими, потому что в этой сборке тёмная и жестокая ночь. Вероятно, было бы неплохо собрать немного еды сейчас...%n%n§lПримечание: вам не нужно хранить эту книгу, вы можете использовать тильду, чтобы открывать квесты без книги.%N§5§5§o§o§n§m§m§n§n§l§n§e§d§c§b§a§9§8§8§7§6§5§4§r%nМы также ведём вики которую можно найти по адресу§E§a§6§4https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page §rобязательно посмотрите её.

# Quest.1 - §1§lWhere is the flint?
gtnh.quest1.name=§1§lWhere is the flint?
gtnh.quest1.desc=As you might have noticed, while collecting gravel, no flint dropped for you. Well, there is a... recipe for that. Look up flint in NEI and craft some!

# Quest.2 - §1§lSticks 'n Stones
gtnh.quest2.name=§1§lSticks 'n Stones
gtnh.quest2.desc=This book has a built-in reading light, lucky you! Most probably you will read this text while you are waiting for the night to be over. Once it is, go out and collect some gravel and wood. Keep in mind that you need food, so look for Pam's Harvestcraft gardens. (And save some of the vegetables for seeds!)

# Quest.3 - §1§lStorage for days
gtnh.quest3.name=§1§lStorage for days
gtnh.quest3.desc=Now that you've unlocked 3x3 crafting, it's about time to make some storage for your goods. Take some of your wood, and craft a chest. You will need 4 wood, 4 planks and 1 flint.

# Quest.4 - §1§lMain Quests and Secondary Quests
gtnh.quest4.name=§1§lMain Quests and Secondary Quests
gtnh.quest4.desc=Now that you have made it this far notice the two new quests. See how these two quests look different? The quest with a crown is a main quest and is linked to other main quests by a thick line. You must complete the main quests to unlock the next tier. The other quest is an optional quest, and is not needed to unlock new tiers. However, optional quests often introduce you to useful items or processes.%n%nNot all main quests have a connecting line to guide you through your adventure because of book size. If there is not an obvious linked main quest at any point, try completing some of the other main quests available to you to progress.%n%nWhat are these coins? You can use them to purchase things in the Coins tab. In case you started in a bad biome, I'll give you enough coins to purchase some saplings.

# Quest.5 - §1§lTools
gtnh.quest5.name=§1§lTools
gtnh.quest5.desc=Now that you've got a shelter, crafting table, and a place to store your items, you should make some tools. (Unless you'd like to continue punching trees with your bare hand...)%n%nNOTE: Make sure to use vanilla sticks, not Natura sticks.

# Quest.6 - §1§lYou reap...
gtnh.quest6.name=§1§lYou reap...
gtnh.quest6.desc=You won't always get food rewards from this book, so it might be a good idea to take care of that problem. As you've created a hoe already, go and find some water nearby and make a field.  With this modpack you can only make farmland within range of water. Let's trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your own farm.%n%nTo get other wheat, use a hoe on grass away from water. You'll get Witchery seeds too, save those for later. Start planting a cotton field, it's a key early game resource.

# Quest.7 - §1§l...what you sow
gtnh.quest7.name=§1§l...what you sow
gtnh.quest7.desc=If you, by chance, did read the previous quest and planted the carrot I gave you, then you're fine. Meanwhile, you should turn some more fruits and vegetables into seeds, and increase the size of your farm to get a steady supply of food.

# Quest.8 - §1§lGet that stone
gtnh.quest8.name=§1§lGet that stone
gtnh.quest8.desc=Look at you, with your shiny flint pickaxe! Time to mine some cobblestone. Yay! (And maybe you can improve this dirt-hut too...)

# Quest.9 - §1§lFire, fire, Grandpa!
gtnh.quest9.name=§1§lFire, fire, Grandpa!
gtnh.quest9.desc=Time to burn some stuff, isn't it? You can't make charcoal in it, but you sure will find some usage for it soon(tm).

# Quest.10 - §1§lRest in pieces
gtnh.quest10.name=§1§lRest in pieces
gtnh.quest10.desc=It's GLOPPing time! Go kill some pigs to gather meat. (And yes, they will drop cooked porkchops. Now isn't that useful...)

# Quest.11 - §1§lSharpness: Over... 5...
gtnh.quest11.name=§1§lSharpness: Over... 5...
gtnh.quest11.desc=It's about time to craft something more useful: A sword!%n%nNow that you have a sword, you will get credit for monster kills in the Kill all the things tab. Watch out, monsters in this world will chew you up and spit you out!

# Quest.12 - §1§lFluffy and red
gtnh.quest12.name=§1§lFluffy and red
gtnh.quest12.desc=Epic quest: Kill some sheep! (And try to get some wool, for a bed, obviously...)

# Quest.13 - §1§lSO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
gtnh.quest13.name=§1§lSO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
gtnh.quest13.desc=Sleepy time, and the end of Tier 0. Congratulations, you've built your first hideout, and you should have a steady supply of food by now. See you again in tier 1!

# Quest.14 - §3§5§lWhat is that...?
gtnh.quest14.name=§3§5§lWhat is that...?
gtnh.quest14.desc=You've seen a lot of trees, but there are a few that look really special. You are sure that these trees are much more than just wood to build your home with or used to get charcoal.%nThe best place to find them is in a Magical Forest, but if you can't find them there you can try a Garden or Cherry Wood Grove.%nIf you have trouble finding them, you can build a special compass in LV to help you locate the biomes.

# Quest.15 - §2§lReady, set, go!
gtnh.quest15.name=§2§lReady, set, go!
gtnh.quest15.desc=You probably should have a home by now. A steady supply of food is a fundamental requirement at all times. Take this journal to keep track of the things you've eaten. You will have to travel far in this tier, better be prepared!

# Quest.16 - §4§3§lBetter Tank... Iron Tank
gtnh.quest16.name=§4§3§lBetter Tank... Iron Tank
gtnh.quest16.desc=Storing more than 16 buckets of fluid in one tank? Sure! Just make an iron tank or upgrade the Buildcraft tank.%nDiamond tanks carry up to 64 buckets and obsidian ones are blast proof.

# Quest.17 - §2§lSand: The Gathering
gtnh.quest17.name=§2§lSand: The Gathering
gtnh.quest17.desc=In a strange vision you saw a big structure which would allow you to make charcoal. Finally some torches! According to your calculations, you will need a lot of sand for that.

# Quest.18 - §2§lBasic processing
gtnh.quest18.name=§2§lBasic processing
gtnh.quest18.desc=Most things are unavailable at the moment, so let's begin with something simple. Take some of your cobblestone and smelt it into regular stone. Since this modpack is evil, you'll need to use wood for that. How much fun is that?!

# Quest.19 - §1§2§lMaceration v0.1 Alpha
gtnh.quest19.name=§1§2§lMaceration v0.1 Alpha
gtnh.quest19.desc=This fancy little device works (almost...) like a macerator. Some people say it's even better, since it does not require power, yay! You only need to craft one for this quest, but you probably should make some more if you can...

# Quest.20 - §2§lGravel: The Gathering
gtnh.quest20.name=§2§lGravel: The Gathering
gtnh.quest20.desc=Your tools will eventually lose durability. You think it would be a good idea to collect more gravel in order to provide yourself with flint for more tools. Try searching near water.

# Quest.21 - §2§lClay: The Gathering
gtnh.quest21.name=§2§lClay: The Gathering
gtnh.quest21.desc=While bored, you thought that it might be a good idea to take up pottery. You should go and find some clay, the riverbanks should have some.

# Quest.22 - §2§lFinite water!?
gtnh.quest22.name=§2§lFinite water!?
gtnh.quest22.desc=Finite water is a problem, that's for sure. Last night, you had an idea. If you can drink cacti, you should also be able make water out of 8 cacti and use that for most recipes that require water. How cool is that? So what about another trade? 10 wood for... 3 cacti so you can setup a farm. Deal?%n%nTo automate the farm, place a string next to the cactus and a sand on top of the string. Now when the cactus grows, it will automatically break!  You can stack this horizontally and vertically to make a very efficient cactus farm.  Use water to redirect the cactus to a convenient pickup location or to above a hopper.%n%nFirst player to make a base running off of only cactus water gets a cape!

# Quest.23 - §2§lSomething to carry liquids
gtnh.quest23.name=§2§lSomething to carry liquids
gtnh.quest23.desc=You tried to move water with your bare hands, which didn't work at all. Luckily, you remember how to make a bucket out of clay dust.%n%nPut it in a mortar to get small clay dust which can be crafted to clay dust.

# Quest.24 - §1§2§lGetting (char)coal
gtnh.quest24.name=§1§2§lGetting (char)coal
gtnh.quest24.desc=It's time to get yourself some charcoal. For that, we're going to build a coke oven. Good that you just collected a lot of resources! (What a coincidence...)

# Quest.25 - §2§lAnother brick in the wall
gtnh.quest25.name=§2§lAnother brick in the wall
gtnh.quest25.desc=Your vision becomes more clear, you'll need bricks for your first multiblock structure. You think that 104 bricks should be enough. However, the bricks you'll need are somewhat special. Make sure to craft the correct ones!

# Quest.26 - §2§lForming press v0.1
gtnh.quest26.name=§2§lForming press v0.1
gtnh.quest26.desc=As you may have noticed, you cannot turn clay into bricks directly. Well, to be fair, it wasn't a good recipe anyway. You'll probably end up with something bread-shaped. So in order to make bricks, you need a form. Get yourself a knife (flint above a stick) and a blank pattern, and cut a brick sized piece out. It's as easy as that.

# Quest.27 - Finally, some power
gtnh.quest27.name=Finally, some power
gtnh.quest27.desc=Now that you have a coke oven, you can start producing charcoal. The more, the better. Don't worry about the creosote oil; I have another deal for you...

# Quest.28 - §2§lCopper sky, Iron curtain
gtnh.quest28.name=§2§lCopper sky, Iron curtain
gtnh.quest28.desc=With your newly acquired fuel source, you are now ready to process more advanced materials than stone or clay; Iron or copper, for example. Just in case you don't know, they spawn in rather large veins. Use the following quests to locate the most important veins.

# Quest.29 - §2§lAnother fuel source
gtnh.quest29.name=§2§lAnother fuel source
gtnh.quest29.desc=Lignite and regular coal are the fuel sources you'll definitely need. The latter can be turned into coal coke, which is a superior fuel source to smelt your first large batch of ore.

# Quest.30 - §2§lCopper
gtnh.quest30.name=§2§lCopper
gtnh.quest30.desc=Copper ingots can be created by smelting copper, chalcopyrite, or malachite ore.

# Quest.31 - §2§lTin
gtnh.quest31.name=§2§lTin
gtnh.quest31.desc=Tin ingots can be created by smelting Tin, Cassiterite, or Cassiterite Sand ore. Tin and Cassiterite ores are only found at high altitudes, but Cassiterite Sand ore is plentiful near the surface.%n%n§5§4Tip: If you get lucky and find a high altitude Tin/Cassiterite vein, save one of the Cassiterite ore to find your Mica vein later on using the ore finder wand.

# Quest.32 - §2§lBook parts
gtnh.quest32.name=§2§lBook parts
gtnh.quest32.desc=After you found a way to move water around, you had another brilliant idea: Paper! Paper is no longer made with sugarcane, you will now need wood pulp. You will need a lot of wood to craft wood pulp, so better grab your axe and go chop some trees.

# Quest.33 - §2§lTinker-time
gtnh.quest33.name=§2§lTinker-time
gtnh.quest33.desc=While using your flint tools is fun in terms of killing pigs and cows, they are not very good, and can't be repaired. You discovered how to craft tools that could be repaired and upgraded, but for that you definitely need a more advanced crafting technique.%n%nIf you have to use wood other than oakwood to make your tables, you can convert them to the default oakwood type to complete this quest.

# Quest.34 - §2§lAluminini...um...?
gtnh.quest34.name=§2§lAluminini...um...?
gtnh.quest34.desc=However it is spelled, you will need it. You can find it in chunks of gravel on the surface.%n%nUse as little as possible and save the rest for when you get a macerator in Steam age.

# Quest.35 - §2§lMaking bronze
gtnh.quest35.name=§2§lMaking bronze
gtnh.quest35.desc=Now that you've found copper and tin, you should make yourself some bronze. Use your macer... mortar to grind up some copper and tin ingots, and mix them together!

# Quest.36 - §2§lImportant tools
gtnh.quest36.name=§2§lImportant tools
gtnh.quest36.desc=In order to craft even basic machines, you'll need new tools. Most of them can be replaced by machines later. For now, you should become familiar with each of their recipes, as you will need a lot of these tools, starting today.%n%nYour new tools can also be used to make Railcraft water tanks, a very useful multiblock considering the finite water feature.%n%nYou want to make the non-electric versions of the screwdriver and wrench.

# Quest.37 - §2§lGetting iron
gtnh.quest37.name=§2§lGetting iron
gtnh.quest37.desc=Iron can be found in multiple veins. %nMagnetite veins (y 30-180), %nchalcopyrite veins (y 5-60), %nand limonite veins (y 10-40) all contain iron ore.

# Quest.38 - §2§lMaking better tools
gtnh.quest38.name=§2§lMaking better tools
gtnh.quest38.desc=With aluminium and copper, you can create a pretty durable material "Aluminum Brass", which can be used to cast better tools. These can be used to mine some more advanced ores.%n%nBut first you need a smeltery. See the Multiblock Goals chapter in this book, or find smeltery blocks in a village nearby.

# Quest.39 - §2§lBetter storage
gtnh.quest39.name=§2§lBetter storage
gtnh.quest39.desc=While standard chests are good for your basic items and goods, they are not ideal for storing a large amount of ore. You should build yourself some barrels in order to keep things organized.

# Quest.40 - §2§lYou shall proceed
gtnh.quest40.name=§2§lYou shall proceed
gtnh.quest40.desc=As you've gathered and crafted all materials and tools you need for your basic steam machinery, you may now proceed to the next tier. Keep in mind that you'll need mountains of resources in order to craft even the simplest things, so you probably should stock up on all ores in this tier. But that's up to you.%n%n§5§5As special reward your get a Holo-Glasses to look inside your inventories.

# Quest.41 - §2§lDon't burn your fingers!
gtnh.quest41.name=§2§lDon't burn your fingers!
gtnh.quest41.desc=You have decided it's time to make some tasty pizza, but your fingers got burned badly. Reading an ancient cookbook you discovered a pair of magical items that would allow you to carry anything hot, even lava in a bucket.%n%n§6§5The gloves have to be placed in the Baubles ring slots of Thaumcraft.%n%n§rFor the protection effect, the hot item has to be in your active slot. I wonder if there is some way to carry more than a few buckets at a time?

# Quest.42 - §2§r§2§lCow Tipper
gtnh.quest42.name=§2§r§2§lCow Tipper
gtnh.quest42.desc=Before you had to kill some pigs and sheep to complete quests. Now it's time to kill some cows and hopefully get some leather. If you are lucky and get a cow trophy you may never need to kill another cow in the future.

# Quest.43 - Cotton, cotton and more cotton
gtnh.quest43.name=Cotton, cotton and more cotton
gtnh.quest43.desc=You find out that cotton is very useful, it can be used to make string, wool, and some other useful items too. Make a small cotton plantation to get tons of it.

# Quest.44 - §3§lWelcome to Tier 1
gtnh.quest44.name=§3§lWelcome to Tier 1
gtnh.quest44.desc=Welcome, and well done so far! This tier is all about your first machines, getting more stuff from your ores and making bronze ingots in a more efficient manner.%n%nFor water, check out the Water Siding Tank multiblock in the Multiblock goals tab.%n%nTo connect up your boilers, be sure to provide water from the bottom.  Wooden pipes are fine for this.  Make sure you never run out of water - adding water to a hot boiler will cause it to explode!%n%nSteam will come out from the sides.  Remember, steam is hot!  It will destroy wooden pipes. And it can burn you if you walk on bronze pipes full of steam.  Cover them with wooden planks or paper.%n%nAnd no, you can't automate it. Make an electric one if you want to do that.

# Quest.45 - §6§lMultiblock tanks... Railcraft tanks
gtnh.quest45.name=§6§lMultiblock tanks... Railcraft tanks
gtnh.quest45.desc=576 buckets of fluid, that should be enough to store all the creosote you have accumulated thus far. If that isn't enough you can make this tank bigger. The smallest tanks are 3x4x3 while the biggest are 9x8x9.%n%nHint: Fluid will auto-output (without any pumps) if you place a valve on the bottom side of the tank. You can color the tank with Buildcraft paintbrushes and the GT spray can.%n%nUse only Buckets to move fluids because cells get destroyed.

# Quest.46 - §3§lMore advanced alloys
gtnh.quest46.name=§3§lMore advanced alloys
gtnh.quest46.desc=Your smeltery does a great job mixing metals into alloys, but it's not very efficient, and limited in its complexity. You need something new, so why not put your steam to some use? The Alloy Smelter can make bronze for you directly, using ingots, dusts, or even nuggets. You can make a nugget mold as well to turn ingots into nuggets.%n%nIt might also come in handy when processing raw rubber. You should keep an eye on recipes to see when machines offer better options to make items...%n%n§4NOTE: Like all steam machines, the output port doubles as a steam outlet when recipes complete. It must not be blocked. Also, steam is hot, remember? Change the output side by whacking with a wrench. The 3x3 grid will show you which side the output will move to when you whack it.%n%nIf you try enabling item output, you'll see it comes out the same side as the steam outlet. How unfortunate! However you can still empty the machine by putting a hopper beneath it. %n%nWARNING: The Alloy Smelter recipes take a *lot* of steam. Do them one by one until you understand how fast you use steam, and how much you will need buffered. Large pipes are a decent "poor mans" buffer, and the boiler can hold quite a bit of steam, as well as the machine itself. Once you get a little further along, make a larger steam buffer with an iron or steel railcraft tank.

# Quest.47 - §3§lUpgrade: High speed alloys
gtnh.quest47.name=§3§lUpgrade: High speed alloys
gtnh.quest47.desc=Like most machines, there is a more advanced version of the alloy smelter. Keep in mind that this machine uses a lot of steam, so you better get some more boilers first. (This quest is optional)

# Quest.48 - §3§lA very important alloy
gtnh.quest48.name=§3§lA very important alloy
gtnh.quest48.desc=The most important alloy (until you reach a higher tier) is undoubtedly red alloy. Fortunately, you have an alloy smelter, so grab some redstone and combine it with copper to get yourself a handful of that. %n%nDon't confuse your bronze with your copper or else you'll be scratching your head.

# Quest.49 - §3§lThe hell is that?
gtnh.quest49.name=§3§lThe hell is that?
gtnh.quest49.desc=In order to get more machines, you'll need pistons. But not those amateurish ones, you need special ones, and I shall guide you in the making of them.

# Quest.50 - §3§lMacerator v1.0!
gtnh.quest50.name=§3§lMacerator v1.0!
gtnh.quest50.desc=Finally you are able to make a device that will replace your mortar. However, the "no-durability" feature of this device comes with a cost: You need 2 diamonds for the grinding heads.%n%nThe macerator will double your ore output. Put ores through it instead of smelting directly.%n%nNOTE: Remember, don't block the output port and don't stand behind it.

# Quest.51 - §3§lExtracting stuff
gtnh.quest51.name=§3§lExtracting stuff
gtnh.quest51.desc=As you'll need rubber later to make cables from wires, you should get yourself a steam extractor. You can also use this machine to get more dyes from flowers, or process different fruits into juice.

# Quest.52 - §3§4§3§lA clear view
gtnh.quest52.name=§3§4§3§lA clear view
gtnh.quest52.desc=Are you still living in your dirt hut/cobble hovel? How about letting in some sunlight? Grind up some sand and flint and craft some glass dust. Put it in your smeltery and pour it into a casting basin to make clear glass.%n%n§4Hint: In order to use it for recipes, you have to chisel it.

# Quest.53 - §3§lHammer time v2
gtnh.quest53.name=§3§lHammer time v2
gtnh.quest53.desc=Using 6 ingots to craft a hammer seems pretty wasteful, as this tool has durability. How nice would it be to have a machine that does the same but without having durability and using three ingots to make two plates? Guess what, there is one! And you should totally get one.

# Quest.54 - §4§3§lCompressing stuff
gtnh.quest54.name=§4§3§lCompressing stuff
gtnh.quest54.desc=This rather simple device does a very important job: compression. It's main function is to press 9 ingots into a block, but it's also useful for a variety of recipes, for example making firm tofu.

# Quest.55 - §4§3§lUpgrade: A better compressor
gtnh.quest55.name=§4§3§lUpgrade: A better compressor
gtnh.quest55.desc=An updated version of the steam compressor. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

# Quest.56 - §3§lUpgrade: Forge hammer
gtnh.quest56.name=§3§lUpgrade: Forge hammer
gtnh.quest56.desc=An updated version of the steam forge hammer. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

# Quest.57 - §3§lUpgrade: Extractor
gtnh.quest57.name=§3§lUpgrade: Extractor
gtnh.quest57.desc=An updated version of the steam extractor. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. You probably want to craft this, as the extractor does also extract your nerves... (This quest is optional)

# Quest.58 - §3§lUpgrade: Better macerator
gtnh.quest58.name=§3§lUpgrade: Better macerator
gtnh.quest58.desc=An updated version of the steam macerator. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

# Quest.59 - §3§lSteam alternatives
gtnh.quest59.name=§3§lSteam alternatives
gtnh.quest59.desc=There is more than one way to get steam for your machines. This completely optional quest shows you some alternative methods for producing steam.

# Quest.60 - §3§lUpgrade: Coal boiler
gtnh.quest60.name=§3§lUpgrade: Coal boiler
gtnh.quest60.desc=This is basically just an upgrade to your current coal boiler, however it produces more than twice as much steam. Something you should consider building if you're planning to get some of the upgraded machines.

# Quest.61 - §3§lAnother use for Java, I mean Lava
gtnh.quest61.name=§3§lAnother use for Java, I mean Lava
gtnh.quest61.desc=With a more durable steel casing, you can use lava to make steam.

# Quest.62 - §3§lThe power of the sun
gtnh.quest62.name=§3§lThe power of the sun
gtnh.quest62.desc=The sun has quite a bit of power, so why not use it to produce steam? %n%nFill it with water on the bottom side to produce steam. Unlike the other boilers, this only outputs steam on the output port side.%n%n§4Hint: The solar boiler calcifies and becomes less efficient over time. It will heat up fast, so make sure you are ready with water.

# Quest.63 - §3§lUsing steam to cook things
gtnh.quest63.name=§3§lUsing steam to cook things
gtnh.quest63.desc=A rather slow process, but it's more efficient than using a regular furnace.

# Quest.64 - §3§lUpgrade: Better furnace
gtnh.quest64.name=§3§lUpgrade: Better furnace
gtnh.quest64.desc=An updated version of the steam furnace. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

# Quest.65 - §3§lBlastoff!
gtnh.quest65.name=§3§lBlastoff!
gtnh.quest65.desc=It's about time to make some steel. Look in the Multiblock Goals quest tab and build a Bricked Blast Furnace. Return here when you made at least 8 steel ingots.

# Quest.66 - §3§lTime for some logic
gtnh.quest66.name=§3§lTime for some logic
gtnh.quest66.desc=Good news! You are now able to advance to the next tier! Bad news: You still have to craft a lot of things before you can begin. Fear not mortal, I shall guide you!

# Quest.67 - §4§3§lWired, weird?!
gtnh.quest67.name=§4§3§lWired, weird?!
gtnh.quest67.desc=One of the very basic materials which you should memorize how to craft are wires and cables. Basically you just cut a plate into a wire with your wire cutter. Not very efficient, but there will be a better way later.

# Quest.68 - §3§lYour first electronic circuit
gtnh.quest68.name=§3§lYour first electronic circuit
gtnh.quest68.desc=Steam machines are quite stupid, they just do one thing over and over again. As you advance into the electrical age, you've decided that you want the machines to have more features, like automatic output in order to create some automation. For that, you need electronic circuits.

# Quest.69 - §3§lWire-Wrap
gtnh.quest69.name=§3§lWire-Wrap
gtnh.quest69.desc=Placing wires without insulation seems to be a bad idea. Now that you have an extractor to extract raw rubber out of sticky resin and an alloy smelter to further process it using sulfur, you should work on getting some insulating rubber sheets.

# Quest.70 - §3§lSteam-a-licious!
gtnh.quest70.name=§3§lSteam-a-licious!
gtnh.quest70.desc=You almost made it. One last crafting step is required in order to advance to Tier 2. Keep going!

# Quest.71 - §3§lBasic crafting: Motors
gtnh.quest71.name=§3§lBasic crafting: Motors
gtnh.quest71.desc=Motors are little devices that can turn electrical power into rotational energy. Very useful for all kind of machines, and not that difficult to craft. The pattern is always the same, only the materials change with tiers. For now you can use redstone to magnetize your iron rod. Later on you will build an Electromagnetic Polarizer.

# Quest.72 - §3§lBasic crafting: Rotors
gtnh.quest72.name=§3§lBasic crafting: Rotors
gtnh.quest72.desc=Rotors are also crafted using an identical pattern with different materials. A bit annoying to craft at the moment, but you don't need a lot of them anyway.

# Quest.73 - §3§lBasic crafting: Casings
gtnh.quest73.name=§3§lBasic crafting: Casings
gtnh.quest73.desc=All machines need a hull to keep their private parts together. Good news is: They are crafted in the same way for every tier, only the materials change.

# Quest.74 - §6§6§a§9§8§7§6§5§4§3§2§1§0§3§f§k§f§l§6§lYou are not prepared!!!
gtnh.quest74.name=§6§6§a§9§8§7§6§5§4§3§2§1§0§3§f§k§f§l§6§lYou are not prepared!!!
gtnh.quest74.desc=It's time for something really big: A smeltery! There's a lot to craft, so better gather some resources...%n%nThe aluminium oreberries can be planted on cropsticks, and macerated to get small quantites of aluminium for molds if you cannot find aluminium gravel.%n%nNote: The book says a 3x3 base, but you can make a smeltery with a smaller base.  Taller/wider smelteries can do more items at one time, conserving fuel.

# Quest.75 - §6§lThe water dilemma
gtnh.quest75.name=§6§lThe water dilemma
gtnh.quest75.desc=Finite water is a problem. But fear not, there are solutions! I shall guide you to a steady supply of water. The Railcraft water siding tanks provides enough water to last the early game.%n%nThe humidity of a biome is very important and will increase the base fill rate.%n%nIf it is raining, the tank will fill much quicker.%n%nAt least one block of the water siding tank must see sky for the maximum output.%n%nThe best part is that you don't need a pump to extract water.  Tanks and pipes placed next to it will be autofilled by the water siding tank.%n

# Quest.76 - §6§lTime to get some steel
gtnh.quest76.name=§6§lTime to get some steel
gtnh.quest76.desc=You need steel? Uhh... fine. Let's get busy...%n%nHint: The bricked blast furnace can share walls with other ones, just like most GT multi blocks. How will this affect the air quality though...%n%nIf you are short on Stone Dust, you can get more by macerating cobblestone.

# Quest.77 - §r§6§l§5§l§o§l§r§6§lEBF-Time
gtnh.quest77.name=§r§6§l§5§l§o§l§r§6§lEBF-Time
gtnh.quest77.desc=In order to get alumin(i)um ingots, you need an electric blast furnace. It's another very important step towards victory, so let's get started.%n%nGetting the Mica for the heating coils might be a little tricky...but you can use a substitute for the first tier of coils.%n%n§4(You need 2 LV hatches with 4A of 32V total, or 3 LV hatches with MOOOORE power if the multiblock is not fully repaired)%n%n§rA few recipes produce CO2/SO2 as fluid. You can put an output fluid hatch to the top layer of the EBF to collect it otherwise it gets auto voided. It depends on the muffler hatch how much fluid you can recover. Bart's Platinum Series recipes otuput fluids on the BOTTOM, so if you want to do Platinum Stuff later, remember that.%n%nMoron always says - Make Muffler Moint Mup.  Or point up, anyways.%n%nIf you want a really fancy EBF, you can add more input fluid hatches and store different fluids in each one.%n%nThe EBF also has a heat adjustment of 100K for each power tier +/- MV. Basically, for CuNi Coils, with an LV Energy Hatch, the heat capacity is 1701K (-100), MV=1801K (no change), HV=1901K (+100), etc. Coils only set the base value.%n%nThis adjustment does not apply to the Volcanus or MEBF.%n%n§4If the pollution gets really bad, check in GT++ Multiblocks for a pollution scrubber, or upgrade your Muffler.%n

# Quest.78 - §6§lUpgrade #1: More heat - Kanthal Coils
gtnh.quest78.name=§6§lUpgrade #1: More heat - Kanthal Coils
gtnh.quest78.desc=Better materials need higher temperatures. You can just exchange the old coils with the new ones. Kanthal coils let you reach 2700 K. You can even reuse the old coils in other machines, how fancy is that!

# Quest.79 - §6§lUpgrade #2: Higher tier - Nichrome Coils
gtnh.quest79.name=§6§lUpgrade #2: Higher tier - Nichrome Coils
gtnh.quest79.desc=To reach the 3600k heat capacity of your EBF, so you can process high-tier materials like tungsten, you need nichrome heating coils.

# Quest.80 - §6§lCompress all the things
gtnh.quest80.name=§6§lCompress all the things
gtnh.quest80.desc=Martin's (DreamMasterXXL) favourite machine. Compress ALL the things! With explosives, of course. Boom today!%n%nNote: You might want to put this far from your living quarters, the pollution can get high really fast.

# Quest.81 - §6§lAt the end of...
gtnh.quest81.name=§6§lAt the end of...
gtnh.quest81.desc=...the universe everything freezes eventually. But waiting for the heat death of the universe might take too long. Therefore we present you the vacuum freezer. It should be good enough to cool your hot stuff. You will need a minimum of 16 frost proof machine casings, the rest depends on your setup.%n%nYou will need to make EV circuits in a cleanroom to build this machine.

# Quest.82 - §7§6§lAn unexpected Bonus
gtnh.quest82.name=§7§6§lAn unexpected Bonus
gtnh.quest82.desc=Because we're nice developers, we decided to add a little bonus if you happen to compress charcoal. Not only does it allow you to process more than 16 steel at a time (not in the bricked blast furnace), it also yields 10 times the burn time of a piece of charcoal. So one charcoal for free. This bonus only occurs on the first compression step. (But for fanciness, you should definitely get a quintuple one!)

# Quest.83 - §6§lHigh speed charcoal
gtnh.quest83.name=§6§lHigh speed charcoal
gtnh.quest83.desc=Sure, those coke ovens are nice, but they aren't even remotely fast enough to keep up with a large steam boiler. Luckily, there is an upgrade available! The creosote oil will not be produced, but the process will speed up dramatically. Who needs that nasty yellowish flammable stuff anyway...

# Quest.84 - §3§lWhere I can put all the liquids?
gtnh.quest84.name=§3§lWhere I can put all the liquids?
gtnh.quest84.desc=With your brand new alloy smelter you are able to combine two materials. What happens if you mix some obsidian dust and thickened glass? Obsidian glass, great. Your first tank that you can make would be a Buildcraft tank. This tank can carry up 16 buckets of a single fluid. It's possible to upgrade those tanks so they can hold up to 64 buckets.%nYou can also stack the tanks to increase capacity.

# Quest.85 - §6§lSmelt all the things stack wise...
gtnh.quest85.name=§6§lSmelt all the things stack wise...
gtnh.quest85.desc=...with this great invention! Uses power to smelt up to 2 stacks of items at once! Can't go any faster! %n%nHint: Parallel smelting depends on coils, consult your local doctor before use.

# Quest.86 - §6§lUpgrade #3: Upgrade tier 4 - Tungstensteel Coils
gtnh.quest86.name=§6§lUpgrade #3: Upgrade tier 4 - Tungstensteel Coils
gtnh.quest86.desc=To process more advanced materials like enderium, enriched naquadah or niobium-titanium you need more than 3600K. Time to upgrade your EBF... again.

# Quest.87 - §6§lSteel multiblock tanks
gtnh.quest87.name=§6§lSteel multiblock tanks
gtnh.quest87.desc=Do you want to have tanks that can hold double the amount of the iron ones? Go ahead and make a steel tank. All sizes allowed from 3x4x3 to 9x8x9 blocks (X and Z must be the same, and odd). Just like the iron tanks, the Buildcraft paintbrush and GT spray can colorize tanks for identification. Get started on that tank farm full of lube!%n%nHint: Fluid will auto-output (without any pumps) if you place a valve on the bottom side of the tank - valves cannot be on an edge!%n%nOnly use buckets or large fluid cells because 1000L GT cells get destroyed.

# Quest.88 - §5§r§5§lWelcome to Tier 2
gtnh.quest88.name=§5§r§5§lWelcome to Tier 2
gtnh.quest88.desc=Why, hello there! Seems you've made it into the electrical age. Don't be so quick to throw away your steam machines, you'll probably want to use them until you reach tier 3.%n%nTo make your life easier, you'll want to focus on getting a wiremill and bender first... once you suffer through making all the machine components.

# Quest.89 - §6§lMV Steam Turbine
gtnh.quest89.name=§6§lMV Steam Turbine
gtnh.quest89.desc=If you decide to use steam in MV tier then it's time to build a steam turbine.

# Quest.90 - §5§lDamn you, wire cutter!
gtnh.quest90.name=§5§lDamn you, wire cutter!
gtnh.quest90.desc=Enough is enough. No more wasting gazillions of ingots just for a couple of wires. Now that you have power, you should go for a wiremill!

# Quest.91 - §5§lYou're gonna hate this #1
gtnh.quest91.name=§5§lYou're gonna hate this #1
gtnh.quest91.desc=The first item you'll need a lot of. If you want to pull items out of chests or barrels you'll need one. %n%nHint: Goes pretty well with item pipes or GT machines, adjust with a screwdriver.%n%n§3PS: Covers have a Shift-Right-Click interface now!

# Quest.92 - §5§lYou're gonna hate this #4
gtnh.quest92.name=§5§lYou're gonna hate this #4
gtnh.quest92.desc=The fourth item you'll need a lot of, and is also a pain to craft. Arguably the most painful item ever. %n%n§4Hint: Works like a conveyor but can work with selected item slots, adjust with a screwdriver.

# Quest.93 - §5§lYou're gonna hate this #2
gtnh.quest93.name=§5§lYou're gonna hate this #2
gtnh.quest93.desc=The second item you'll need a lot. When you want to get fluid out of tanks you'll need one. %n%nHint: Attach to fluid pipes or GT machines. Adjust the direction and redstone behavior with a screwdriver. Place it on the side facing the tank or machine.  When looking at a pipe or machine, you can use the grid to place it on a side already touching another thing. You can use the grid with a screwdriver to adjust a cover on that side as well.%n%nWhen a GT pipe or machine has any cover, including a pump cover, wrenching the machine back into an item keeps the cover on that machine.  The cover stays with the machine in the same N S E W direction when it is placed down again. This way you can arrange pump and conveyor covers on a machine outside a tight spot and place it there. To remove covers, use the crowbar.%n%nIt can also be further upgraded into a fluid regulator that allows precise control of fluid transfer speed.%n%n§3PS: Covers have a Shift-Right-Click interface now!

# Quest.94 - §5§lElectric macerator
gtnh.quest94.name=§5§lElectric macerator
gtnh.quest94.desc=It is highly recommended to get one of these, as the efficiency in terms of coal/steam used to macerate something is a lot better when using EU.

# Quest.95 - §5§lYou're gonna hate this #3
gtnh.quest95.name=§5§lYou're gonna hate this #3
gtnh.quest95.desc=A piston, but more .. "electrical". The third item you are going to craft a lot of in the future.

# Quest.96 - §5§lSaving redstone
gtnh.quest96.name=§5§lSaving redstone
gtnh.quest96.desc=Tired of using 4 redstone for one magnetic iron rod? Well, good news for you! The polarizer doesn't need redstone, just a little bit of power. You don't need to attach this machine to a permanent power source, it runs fine on battery power.

# Quest.97 - §5§lAvengers, assemble!
gtnh.quest97.name=§5§lAvengers, assemble!
gtnh.quest97.desc=An absolute must have for fans of the movie. Oh, and to make all the things, of course.%n%n§4Hint: You can use the battery slot and other extra slot in the GUI to store unused configuration circuits.

# Quest.98 - §5§lNo more filing
gtnh.quest98.name=§5§lNo more filing
gtnh.quest98.desc=Why waste a full ingot to make a rod by using a tool which loses durability and takes even MORE ingots? With this little device, all your rod-needs shall be fulfilled (for now).

# Quest.99 - Bzzz... Whoom... (Defunct do not complete)
gtnh.quest99.name=Bzzz... Whoom... (Defunct do not complete)
gtnh.quest99.desc=Making some flawless crystals requires a precision laser engraver.%nAt MV level the precision laser engraver becomes more important.

# Quest.100 - §5§lPress all the things
gtnh.quest100.name=§5§lPress all the things
gtnh.quest100.desc=With the basic forming press you can make different food items, glass arrows and some Project Red components. %n%nAt MV/HV stage you can make rotors, various AE components and make copies of your molds and extruder shapes.

# Quest.101 - §5§lMjolnir!!! (electric forge hammer)
gtnh.quest101.name=§5§lMjolnir!!! (electric forge hammer)
gtnh.quest101.desc=Not really required, but it is a lot faster than the steam one and it can be automated. If you feel like ore washing is too slow, use this hammer. There are no recipes that require anything more than steam level to hammer something.

# Quest.102 - §5§lCutting things apart
gtnh.quest102.name=§5§lCutting things apart
gtnh.quest102.desc=An absolutely mandatory machine to have. It will cut rods into bolts, plates into casings, logs into planks, and all of that will be done with the highest possible efficiency. Totally worth it! %n%n§4Hint: Just add water. Later on lubricant will help it run faster.

# Quest.103 - §5§lGet ready for Tier 3
gtnh.quest103.name=§5§lGet ready for Tier 3
gtnh.quest103.desc=In order to proceed forward, you need to get aluminium. A lot of it. But for now, nine is enough to unlock this quest. Probably the best source for aluminium is clay or hardened clay from canyons, however you need an MV machine for that. So you need to find an alternative until you have enough dusts for your initial setup. Check back in your Tier 0.5 quests for hints.%nOnce you have the dusts, you will need to do the EBF quest in Multiblock Goals to turn the dusts into ingots.%nAlso check the Armor and Jetpacks tab for new unlocks.

# Quest.104 - §5§lYour magic progression
gtnh.quest104.name=§5§lYour magic progression
gtnh.quest104.desc=Now that you are able to produce aluminium, you may dig into magic. If you haven't unlocked basic thaumaturgy, try to find a silverwood and a greatwood sapling.

# Quest.105 - §5§lThe missing one
gtnh.quest105.name=§5§lThe missing one
gtnh.quest105.desc=It was once said... <basdxz> But ffs, add a plate bender to the LV tier book ...and then it popped into existence.

# Quest.106 - Your first automation
gtnh.quest106.name=Your first automation
gtnh.quest106.desc=Well, probably not the first, but definitely something big! You will need a cart assembler first.

# Quest.107 - Cart modules: Power Coal
gtnh.quest107.name=Cart modules: Power Coal
gtnh.quest107.desc=Your cart needs power, obviously. A cart can be powered via coal, solar, or lava. But for now you have to use a simple coal engine.

# Quest.108 - Automated (un-)loading
gtnh.quest108.name=Automated (un-)loading
gtnh.quest108.desc=You can fill and empty your cart manually, but it's a lot more convenient to automate item transfer, isn't it?

# Quest.109 - Cart modules: Farming
gtnh.quest109.name=Cart modules: Farming
gtnh.quest109.desc=Unfortunately, the basic farmer can't farm anything besides wheat, carrots and potatoes. It's not expensive at all, and probably the cheapest solution to give your automated food production a nice boost.

# Quest.110 - Cart modules: Storage
gtnh.quest110.name=Cart modules: Storage
gtnh.quest110.desc=A basic cart can't hold any items, so you need to attach special chests to it.

# Quest.111 - A simple cart
gtnh.quest111.name=A simple cart
gtnh.quest111.desc=In order to create or customize your cart you need a hull to attach your desired upgrades to. The wooden one can be used for really simple applications, but to farm wheat or wood, you need at least an iron one.%n%n§c§lWARNING: §r§cUnprotected carts can be knocked off their rails by lightning. Cover the area with glass to prevent carts from disappearing.%n%nAlso, make sure to keep your cart in one chunk, or use chunkloaders covering the whole area the cart works within. Loading/unloading chunks may cause carts to disappear or duplicate.

# Quest.112 - Cart modules: Wood cutter
gtnh.quest112.name=Cart modules: Wood cutter
gtnh.quest112.desc=The basic wood cutter will break after a while, but you never have to replace it. It can easily be repaired with diamonds.

# Quest.113 - §5§lBasic transport pipe
gtnh.quest113.name=§5§lBasic transport pipe
gtnh.quest113.desc=These pipes are rather simple and won't do anything on their own. But in combination with transfer nodes, you'll soon find out how great they are. Also, given the correct upgrades, they even surpass most other transfer systems.

# Quest.114 - §5§lBasic transport: Items
gtnh.quest114.name=§5§lBasic transport: Items
gtnh.quest114.desc=In order to transfer items, you need so called "nodes". There are some for pushing items into a pipe system, and later you'll have access to nodes that are able to pull items from attached inventories.

# Quest.115 - §5§lBasic transport: Fluids
gtnh.quest115.name=§5§lBasic transport: Fluids
gtnh.quest115.desc=Just like item nodes, liquid nodes transfer... liquids. But probably the best thing: They can all utilize the same transfer pipe!

# Quest.116 - §5§lAlloy smelter
gtnh.quest116.name=§5§lAlloy smelter
gtnh.quest116.desc=Upgrade your steam alloy smelter to an LV one.

# Quest.117 - §5§lGotta catch 'em all
gtnh.quest117.name=§5§lGotta catch 'em all
gtnh.quest117.desc=Sure, you can use wheat/potatoes/carrots to make animals follow you back to your base, but that can be tedious. A golden lasso is a proper solution for animal transportation.

# Quest.118 - §5§lBasic monster protection
gtnh.quest118.name=§5§lBasic monster protection
gtnh.quest118.desc=Spawning monsters in or near your base can be annoying. Especially if you happen to get infernal creepers. Luckily, there is a good way to prevent them from spawning at all.

# Quest.119 - §3§lA quite different storage
gtnh.quest119.name=§3§lA quite different storage
gtnh.quest119.desc=Regular chests can fill up rather quickly if you happen to collect mob drops like swords and/or armor. By using a cabinet, you can store up to 270 items of the same type.  Also, it doesn't need a dolly - you can break it normally and it will retain contents. %nPerfect for storing ic2 crops, Forestry saplings, or bees!

# Quest.120 - §5§lProtect your base; Tier 1
gtnh.quest120.name=§5§lProtect your base; Tier 1
gtnh.quest120.desc=One needs proper protection for ones home. So why not get some turrets for safety? At the moment, 2 Turrets are available: "Potato" and "disposable item". I assume you can guess what they do and how they work...

# Quest.121 - §5§lPassive defence
gtnh.quest121.name=§5§lPassive defence
gtnh.quest121.desc=A more "passive" approach to base defence are walls and fences. But seriously, where is the fun in that?

# Quest.122 - §4§5§lTurret base
gtnh.quest122.name=§4§5§lTurret base
gtnh.quest122.desc=Turrets must be placed on top of a turret base. Only the player who initially placed the base can access and configure the turret. So don't worry about people taking your ammunition.

# Quest.123 - §5§lWho needs that dirt anyway
gtnh.quest123.name=§5§lWho needs that dirt anyway
gtnh.quest123.desc=You probably have a ton of items floating around in your base. So why not use them to kill your enemies?

# Quest.124 - §5§lDon't play with your food!
gtnh.quest124.name=§5§lDon't play with your food!
gtnh.quest124.desc=Use it to kill zombies instead. Does only a little damage, but hey, who cares?

# Quest.125 - §5§lUpgrading intensifies
gtnh.quest125.name=§5§lUpgrading intensifies
gtnh.quest125.desc=Your turrets probably need more space to hold more ammunition, so why not get an upgrade for that?

# Quest.126 - §6§lElectrolysing all the things
gtnh.quest126.name=§6§lElectrolysing all the things
gtnh.quest126.desc=Collected a lot of dusts since you started with macerating, washing and centrifuging ores? Until now you couldn't separate them. It's time to get all the pure and valuable materials out of them.

# Quest.127 - Project red beginning
gtnh.quest127.name=Project red beginning
gtnh.quest127.desc=Welcome to Project Red!%n%nThis quest will teach you the basics of Projectred and show you how to set up a Ghetto AE system.%n%nThe Ghetto AE system will be really useful for sorting all of your first items%n%nFirst of all there are different types of pipes: %n%nItem Transport pipes are the most basic pipes, classified as Null-logic. They don't do anything besides connect other pipes together.%nItem Transport pipes only have the ability to take items that enter it and pass them along to another connected pipe. They will NOT connect to inventories at all. In a junction where there is more than 1 possible direction, item payloads will travel in a randomly selected direction.%n %nRouted pipes are the most advanced. These pipes 'communicate' with one-another to form pipe networks, in order to allow for incredibly complicated demand driven systems, with absolutely no redstone circuitry required.%n %nPressurized pipes are pipes that use a pressure based routing system where the payload travels to the closest inventory that can accept it. Finding the closest inventory is influenced by both distance and Pressure Resistance Pipes (which, to the path finder, are 1000 blocks long), but the actual path that items take is only influenced by distance.%n%nHowever, in order to control the logic of the routed pipes you will need special circuit chips.

# Quest.128 - §6§lIO, IO, it's off to EnderIO we go
gtnh.quest128.name=§6§lIO, IO, it's off to EnderIO we go
gtnh.quest128.desc=You've probably used EnderIO before. It's quite useful for a lot of things. But a lot of stuff has changed here, so let's start from scratch.

# Quest.129 - §6§lMachine chassis
gtnh.quest129.name=§6§lMachine chassis
gtnh.quest129.desc=All EnderIO machines still require the basic chassis, and it's almost the same recipe as before; Except that you need plates instead of ingots. But that shouldn't be a problem at all...

# Quest.130 - §6§lPortable tanks
gtnh.quest130.name=§6§lPortable tanks
gtnh.quest130.desc=Until now, you had to use buildcraft tanks to carry liquids around. Which can be a pain to do. These little tanks from EnderIO are able to push and pull liquids by themselves, as they have a built-in pump which is powered by some magic energy source. How convenient.%n%n§4Just be careful, because it will eat water cells instead of returning them.%n%nPressurized tanks are twice as large.

# Quest.131 - §6§lSimple RF power: Solid
gtnh.quest131.name=§6§lSimple RF power: Solid
gtnh.quest131.desc=By simply burning coal as fuel, this machine produces RF power. Enough for a basic machine setup. This machine will also accept compressed and multiple-compressed blocks.  Want to burn for 250+ days? Also, with double or octadic capacitors the output will increase and efficiency will improve. GT wiring can convert EU to RF, but not the other way around. Ender IO machines and GT cables and Wires can be left safely out in the rain. %n%nIt might be useful for Genetics machines since they consume excessive power when attached to GT wiring - Forestry and EnderIO machines work fine (except for the Thermionic Fabricator). Or use a Capacitor Bank.

# Quest.132 - §6§lSimple RF power: Liquids
gtnh.quest132.name=§6§lSimple RF power: Liquids
gtnh.quest132.desc=This generator requires both water as coolant, and a burnable liquid as fuel. The amount of power it produces depends on the type of liquid used.

# Quest.133 - §9§lThe power of enderman
gtnh.quest133.name=§9§lThe power of enderman
gtnh.quest133.desc=Elevators are nice, but they are limited to vertical teleportation, and their range is also somewhat limited. Travel anchors do not have that limitation. You can teleport from one anchor to any other within range. You can name them and even set them as private. They have a 2s cooldown.

# Quest.134 - §6§lConduits
gtnh.quest134.name=§6§lConduits
gtnh.quest134.desc=Probably the most awesome way to transport just anything in multiple different ways. Get some conduits of each type. Higher tiers of each exist.

# Quest.135 - §6§lYet another wrench
gtnh.quest135.name=§6§lYet another wrench
gtnh.quest135.desc=The Yeta Wrench is more than just a regular wrench. While holding it, you are able to switch between conduit types, eventually allowing you to remove one specific conduit type from a bundle of many. Ctrl-Mousewheel will switch modes, also Shift-Leftclick allows you to open the configuration interface even if you don't have access to that side of the conduit.

# Quest.136 - §6§lImproving conduits
gtnh.quest136.name=§6§lImproving conduits
gtnh.quest136.desc=Conduits on their own are pretty awesome, but you can do better. By using filters and speed upgrades, you gain even more control over what they do and how fast they work.

# Quest.137 - §6§lMaking things pretty
gtnh.quest137.name=§6§lMaking things pretty
gtnh.quest137.desc=While conduits on their own are already awesome, you can also hide them if you want. There are 2 types of facades, basic and hardened. While basic ones are simple and easy, the reinforced ones are able to withstand explosions and mining with tools. You have to use your Yeta Wrench to remove it.

It can be upgraded to teleport the player.%n%nDark shears can be empowered, and then will shear a large area, including leaves. Handy for clearing away that giant redwood! Maybe you will find other uses for it.%n%nThe axe, once empowered, can be recharged wirelessly while in farming station.%n%nThe pick? Well, it can mine cobalt I guess if you haven't gotten a tool capable of that yet. You could keep it around to use for base decorations if your normal pick is too fast, I supose.

# Quest.141 - §9§lVibrant Crystals
gtnh.quest141.name=§9§lVibrant Crystals
gtnh.quest141.desc=Vibrant capacitor banks also need this magical crystal. Armor and tools can be upgraded too.

# Quest.145 - §6§lOre processing kind of...
gtnh.quest145.name=§6§lOre processing kind of...
gtnh.quest145.desc=The endless war between macerators and SAG mills rages on eternal, so why does it matter which one you choose?%n%nHV Macerators are still required for the final byproducts on many ore chains, but a SAG mill still shines through with%nupgraded grinding heads! SAG mills are perfect machine for getting the most from your ores without using bees and crops.%nYou can get bonus outputs with tungsten grinding heads, but that doesn't mean you can dupe materials (like ingots) with it.%n%nPlus for many of them you'll get the final output directly without any need for further processing.  Handy for processing Redstone to get Chrome!%n%nIt's great for lead, copper, tin, silver, nickel, redstone, ruby, lapis, certus quartz, and malachite ores. Other ores will give you better outputs as well if you use a good enough head.%n%nEven coal, charcoal,bones, wheat, ender pearls, and charcoal non-ores will give bonus outputs.%n

Plan for the configuration to grow in size up to 23x23 for a single altar.%n%nKeep in mind that you get less blood, and use more when crafting in GTNH. Plan for pain and frustration too.%n%nThe altar has a 10,000L blood tank, plus a 1,000L I/O buffer (you can pump in and out, but the rate is pitifully low at the start). Blood will flow to the I/O buffer until it's full, so be aware of that before your first craft.

# Quest.164 - Portable battery...
gtnh.quest164.name=Portable battery...
gtnh.quest164.desc=Using this binds it to you (expect to do that a lot), and consumes one heart while depositing 200LP in your 'soul network'. You can draw upon the soul network for anything that needs LP such as Alchemy or Rituals. If you want to automate it, you can put it into your altar for a 1:1 conversion of blood. %n%nThe highest tier orb you have bound will be considered the maximum limit to LP in your network, but you'll need to put it into the appropriately tiered altar to keep absorbing blood.

# Quest.165 - §9§lSoul eater
gtnh.quest165.name=§9§lSoul eater
gtnh.quest165.desc=Wouldn't it be great to actually make use of the intelligence or abilities a certain creature has? For example: enderman teleportation or brain capacity of a zombie for simple logic? (He doesn't use it anyway...) With this machine, you are able to bind a captured soul to an item, which can then be used in machines to improve their functionality.

# Quest.178 - It's storage time!
gtnh.quest178.name=It's storage time!
gtnh.quest178.desc=Now that you've reached the High Voltage age, you might consider starting to work on your applied energistics system. It might be small, and it might be tricky to power it at first, but it's really worth the effort. You should start by getting all 4 different inscriber patterns.

# Quest.179 - Find them all
gtnh.quest179.name=Find them all

gtnh.quest181.name=Fluix Crystals
gtnh.quest181.desc=Not "flux"! Even if the color is the same. You need to add redstone and nether quartz to a charged certus crystal.

# Quest.182 - Applied Crafting
gtnh.quest182.name=Applied Crafting
gtnh.quest182.desc=Crafting can be a pain. So why not automate it? These can hold a single pattern each. However, if you place an ME interface against it, you can use it to craft any of the patterns in it. You can use multiple with the same MA, and given how expensive they are now, that might be a good idea. These do NOT require a channel, but do require network access.

# Quest.183 - Getting Your First Processors
gtnh.quest183.name=Getting Your First Processors
gtnh.quest183.desc=There are 3 different ways to make AE2 processors. First, there's the AE2 Inscribers, which are slow, hold one of each item at a time, require inputs (and output) from specific directions, but can be sped up with cards. Second, there's the Advanced Inscribers, which are similar, but allow stacking, and do not require specific dirctions. Lastly, there's GT Assemblers (and later the multiblock) which can be very fast, but require a fluid input, and consume more power. Get 8 of each one for now.

# Quest.184 - Cables
gtnh.quest184.name=Cables
gtnh.quest184.desc=To have access to your applied energistics network from your entire base, you'll need cables. A lot of them. For now, the basic ones will do, but eventually, you'll end up using dense cables and p2p channels. Glass and Covered cables are functionally identical, just different in looks. Each can carry 8 channels.  Quartz fibers don't carry channels but can carry energy. This is useful for providing power from your main network to independant subnetworks.%n%nYou can also color your cables - cables with different colors will not connect, so those can be used to expand network capacity by running parallel cables. Only fluix colored cables connect to all other colors. Later it will probably be more efficient to use P2P channels to jam a bunch of channels into 1.%n%nAnchors are like covers, keeping things from connecting when you don't want them to.

# Quest.185 - Basic Terminals
gtnh.quest185.name=Basic Terminals
gtnh.quest185.desc=The ME Terminal is an interface which gives you access to an ME network's networked storage. It has the ability to sort and search, as well as filter by using a view cell.%n%nThe ME Crafting Terminal is the upgraded version of the ME terminal which has an integrated crafting grid with access to an ME network's networked storage.%n%nThe ME Interface Terminal gives remote access to all interface pattern slots on your network separated by which type of machine they are on. It will show the type of machine in the terminal, however you can name the ME interface in the inscriber or an anvil to alter the name displayed in the ME interface terminal. If you use Ender Chests to send stuff elsewhere to be processed a lot, this may help with reducing confusion. You can also search for a specific device.

# Quest.189 - §a§lHEV Mark III protective system
gtnh.quest189.name=§a§lHEV Mark III protective system
gtnh.quest189.desc=Some things are dirty, and some things are even dangerous. You'll play with nasty stuff here, so better prepare yourself for the worst.%n%nSome items will give you a Radiation debuff without protection. How fast you get it depends on the item. Some items will give you enormous amounts of time with it, which will kill you because there is no way to get rid of it. %n%nOther items will give you a general sickness with many debuffs, but not Radiation. That can be removed the normal ways, Milk, Terrawart, Aqua bees, etc.

# Quest.190 - §a§lAppropriate power
gtnh.quest190.name=§a§lAppropriate power
gtnh.quest190.desc=Whether you used magic, steam, oil or biogas for power until now, you will run into problems as you advance to higher tiers. So you need to upgrade your power grid, at least for your blast furnaces. So let's start with something more powerful: A nuclear reactor!%n%n§4Hint:%nThe multiplier is set to 10x in this pack.

A perfect "fission and forget" power source.%n%nHint:%nAfter they are used up you can recycle them to get Lutetium which is used for make americium in the fusion reactor.%nAmericium is needed for top tier materials later, so start stockpiling now. Plus, you get power!

# Quest.194 - §a§lMonitoring your reactor
gtnh.quest194.name=§a§lMonitoring your reactor
gtnh.quest194.desc=It's important to monitor your reactor (Or just fancy to have a big screen somewhere...).

# Quest.197 - §a§lVenting heat
gtnh.quest197.name=§a§lVenting heat
gtnh.quest197.desc=You can't just move the heat around, eventually you need to get rid of it. Just like the exchangers, there are different types of vents, each of them has a certain usage you'll need to find out.

# Quest.198 - Double the fun
gtnh.quest198.name=Double the fun
gtnh.quest198.desc=Need even more power? Why not combine rods? Produces twice the amount of power (and heat, obviously) but only uses up one slot.

gtnh.quest202.name=§c§lAccelerating things
gtnh.quest202.desc=If an ender quarry won't satisfy your needs for MOOORE. A speed upgrade is required.

# Quest.203 - Bundled AE channels
gtnh.quest203.name=Bundled AE channels
gtnh.quest203.desc=P2P tunnels. You will need a lot of them! These are fancy fluid/item pipes that will transport fluids or items from one "point" to "another".  Items transported will not show up on crafting terminals etc, they just use the network as transport.%n%nThey can also pack up to 32 channels into 1 bundle and transport those to the destination p2p bus.  Each P2P tunnel requires 1 free channel. The network carrying the P2P must be separate from the network with the channels. These P2P connections cannot be nested, but one transport cable can carry multiple P2P connections.%n%nGenerally, you'll want to have the first point be one side of an ME Controller block (remember you can add more!), and the other where your machines are.%n%nA nice online guide can be found at https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-AE2 under P2P tunnels.

# Quest.226 - See the unseen
gtnh.quest226.name=See the unseen
gtnh.quest226.desc=Everything is made of 6 primal aspects. Those aspects can be combined to form compound aspects, but in the end, there are only 6. Like the infused shards you found. You noticed that those shards start to vibrate when you bring them next to something that is made of the respective aspect. Maybe you can create a device to actually "scan" items, and reveal their compounds? This could be very useful later on.

# Quest.227 - Tables to work on
gtnh.quest227.name=Tables to work on
gtnh.quest227.desc=Indeed, the idea with the bookshelf did work. Now you need a nice table to do some research on, and probably something to infuse items with vis while crafting. Maybe you should try to smite a table with your wand.

gtnh.quest229.name=Infused stones
gtnh.quest229.desc=This whole place here is filled with magic. No matter where you look at, it's just everywhere. You wonder what happens to regular stone if it's exposed to large amounts of magic for such a long time. Maybe it's time to go mining?

# Quest.230 - Your first wand
gtnh.quest230.name=Your first wand
gtnh.quest230.desc=You are sure that this place will give you all the answers you are looking for! To continue, you need something to handle the magic energy called "vis". Guess it's time to craft your first wand.

gtnh.quest231.name=Tome of knowledge
gtnh.quest231.desc=All the things you've discovered so far, you need to write them down. But you are lazy, and you have a wand, so why not try a magical way to "write down" your research? You wonder if you could enchant a book with your wand, so that it will keep track of your progress... You should try that on a bookshelf!

# Quest.232 - Improving your wand
gtnh.quest232.name=Improving your wand
gtnh.quest232.desc=Your wand does a great job in storing and releasing vis as you please. However, those iron caps are... Weak. If you don't pay enough attention to it, it might hurt the node. Maybe you should try to improve it with caps made out of a more valuable material. Like.. gold, perhaps?

# Quest.233 - Getting shards
gtnh.quest233.name=Getting shards
gtnh.quest233.desc=Now that you found all six primal types of infused stone, you need to break those up in order to get the shards. The easiest way to do that, is to throw these stones in your Forge Hammer. Later when you have a Sifter, you can sift purified ores for more shards. An autoclave can turn shard dust into a shard. Maybe there is a magical way to do the same thing?

# Quest.234 - A "greater" wand
gtnh.quest234.name=A "greater" wand
gtnh.quest234.desc=While doing all your research and mining of these infused stones, you had an idea how to actually use the wood of a Greatwood tree to make a new wand.

# Quest.235 - Better screws
gtnh.quest235.name=Better screws
gtnh.quest235.desc=Unfortunately, your aluminium screws don't work with the greatwood rod. Somehow, the wood seems to repel the material. Luckily, you already have a blast furnace, so you can get a better material than aluminium.

# Quest.236 - A more powerful "scale"
gtnh.quest236.name=A more powerful "scale"
gtnh.quest236.desc=The naga scales are weak, they can only hold a very limited amount of vis. You need a better, more powerful component to store vis in your wand. You've heard rumors about an evil wizard in the Twilight Forest. Maybe he has... something... that can be used?

# Quest.237 - "Stores 50 vis" wand
gtnh.quest237.name="Stores 50 vis" wand
gtnh.quest237.desc=Now combine your new wand, and be more powerful than before! You have a feeling, that this new wand will come in handy very soon(tm).%nMake sure you use the NEI 'U' command on the gold caps to find the correct GT:NH recipe for the wand.

gtnh.quest238.name=Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
gtnh.quest238.desc=Your arcane table does a great job with infusing primal vis into items while crafting. However, you feel that there must be more. What if you could infuse items with all kinds of magic aspects? The possibilities are endless...

# Quest.239 - Yet another brick in the wall...
gtnh.quest239.name=Yet another brick in the wall...
gtnh.quest239.desc=A magical one this time. You are on your way to infusion, and you need 8 of those in total.

# Quest.240 - Essentia cooking
gtnh.quest240.name=Essentia cooking

Obviously, you only want to dissolve those items you don't really need, and only those with essentia you need to craft things.%n%nMake sure you keep your furnace as empty as possible. If it fills up with essentia, it can cause a large TPS drop.

# Quest.241 - Not for soup
gtnh.quest241.name=Not for soup
gtnh.quest241.desc=At least not for edible soup, but for essentia slurry. Get yourself a Cauldron and give it a solid whack with your wand. Place the netherrack under the crucible and set it on fire with the flint and steel. Now you need to fill it with water (works with pipes too = auto refill)

gtnh.quest242.name=Balanced shards sdrahs decnalaB
gtnh.quest242.desc=By combining all six primal aspects in a crucible, you are able to make balanced shards. They can be ground up into "Salis Mundus", an absolutely crucial thing to have, trust me!

gtnh.quest245.name=The choice...
gtnh.quest245.desc=By now, you should've collected a few (or a lot) of locations for aura nodes to get vis from. You  might also have noticed, that you probably are low on a certain aspect, like ordo or ignis. Well, good news. In exchange for some crystal clusters, I will give you one of my old nodes.

But be warned, young one. The further you progress, the more darkness, and evil will tempt you to follow the forbidden ways of magic. I have seen things... weather changing, random teleportation, or even a Wither tearing its way into our universe right next to someone. Be careful, my friend...

# Quest.253 - Turning liquids into essentia
gtnh.quest253.name=Turning liquids into essentia
gtnh.quest253.desc=What a simple idea. So many people wasted tons of buckets just to get aqua from water, or sano from milk. Why didn't they just dissolve the liquid itself? Stupid ones...

gtnh.quest254.name=Essentia filtering
gtnh.quest254.desc=This nifty little device will filter out essentia. Once it has received a single unit of any type, it will only accept this type until it is completely empty. How convenient. You can place more than one on top of an alchemical furnace.

# Quest.256 - Not coal
gtnh.quest256.name=Not coal

# Quest.266 - More durable screws
gtnh.quest266.name=More durable screws
gtnh.quest266.desc=Those stainless steel screws don't work on these rods. Due to the huge amounts of vis those wands can carry, the screws somehow "melt" away. I need a more durable material. I guess I will try titanium next.

# Quest.276 - Bring it home
gtnh.quest276.name=Bring it home
gtnh.quest276.desc=You probably have a nice collection of bookmarked nodes. But running around to recharge your wand(s) isn't really the way an adept thaumaturge should get his required vis. Moving nodes is not that hard, but without doubt, you need something to protect them from each other.

# Quest.330 - Magical Waystones
gtnh.quest330.name=Magical Waystones
gtnh.quest330.desc=This can be used to go back to a Celestial Gateway if you have a bound Celestial Pearl in your hotbar. It will use the leftmost one in your hotbar, so you can carry multiple to travel around!

Nope, it's a celestial gateway!%n%n10 can be set per device, so get creative! ...Unless you want to go to other Dims, which it can't do. But hey, faster travel around your base!

# Quest.332 - Fire burn and...
gtnh.quest332.name=Fire burn and...
gtnh.quest332.desc=In order to get started with your basic witchery needs, you need a witches oven. It requires anointing paste, which you will need an MV mixer to make.%n%nThe witches oven is used to get the most basic ingredients for your recipes - Fumes.%n%nThe oven is able to capture the by-products produced in the cooking process. Activating the oven to show the interface screen, you will see an additional slot to the right of the fuel slot. Clay jars must be placed in this slot. If there are clay jars present when something is cooked, there is a chance a by-product will be captured in one of the jars. These by-products are important ingredients in other recipes. If there are no clay jars in the oven when something is cooked, no by-products will be produced.%n%nUpgrading an Oven%n%nAn oven can be upgraded by placing either a Fume Funnel or a Filtered Fume Funnel to the left and right of it. Each Fume Funnel will increase the cooking speed by and additional 10 per cent (over a furnace) and increase the chance of a by-product being produced by and additional 25 per cent for a Fume Funnel or 30 per cent for a Filtered Fume Funnel.%nAn Oven can use at most two upgrades and they must have the same facing as the oven.%n%nA fully upgraded oven will therefore cook at 130 per cent speed (compared to a furnace) and have a chance of a by-product of 90 per cent.

# Quest.333 - Offerings
gtnh.quest333.name=Offerings
gtnh.quest333.desc=For all your offering needs. And of course, it looks fancy!%n%nAn altar is created by placing six altar blocks in a 2x3 pattern; you will know it is correct when a red cloth appears over the top of the altar.%n%nActivating the altar by right-clicking on it will bring up a screen showing how much power the altar has collected, how much it can collect and its current recharge rate. It is important to check that there is sufficient available power to perform a given rite or use a distillery or kettle recipe.%n%nThe maximum amount of power available is determined by how many natural items are in the vicinity of the altar: dirt, grass, trees, plants, etc. all contribute; stone and sand do not. The important thing is to have a diverse mix of different plants, trees and crops (plants from other mods are supported to an extent as well).%n%nCertain objects (or foci), placed onto an altar, will boost the focusing capabilities of an altar, either improving the amount of magic it can focus, the rate at which it replenishes or the range it can distribute power. Only one of each type of item (skull, chalice, etc.) will have an effect. There may also be other less savory foci that dark magic practitioners could make use of.

# Quest.334 - ...Cauldron bubble
gtnh.quest334.name=...Cauldron bubble
gtnh.quest334.desc=The second thing you'll need is a cauldron. It is used to craft most of the basic items, like mutandis.%n%nIt is made by placing a regular Cauldron in the world, and then using Anointing Paste on it.%n%nTo brew a potion, cast a ritual or create an item, the cauldron must first be filled with water. This can be achieved by using three buckets of water on it, pumping water into it using pipes, or by using a Dispenser containing a Brew of Endless Water.%n%nOnce a cauldron is full of water, it must boil. Lighting a fire beneath the cauldron is the only way for this to happen. Using a netherrack block will guarantee the fire does not go out, although if it does go out, it may be set to boil again without any consequences (unlike brewing in a Kettle!).%n%nWhen the water is boiling, ingredients may be added to the Cauldron (one after another), to create the desired effect. The book, Witches' Brews gives a complete overview of all ingredients and what they can do when added to a brew.

# Quest.335 - Don't touch the needle!
gtnh.quest335.name=Don't touch the needle!
gtnh.quest335.desc=While having not many recipes by itself, the few it has are rather important for your further witchery progression.

# Quest.336 - Probably usable for soup
gtnh.quest336.name=Probably usable for soup
gtnh.quest336.desc=But its main purpose is to brew potions and infusions.%n%nA kettle must be set up in the correct way, before it may be used. %n%nFirstly, a fire must be set under the kettle (netherrack is best for this, but wood will do just as well). %n%nNext the kettle must be filled by using a Water-filled Bucket on it. %n%nThirdly, each of the six ingredients for the brew or infusion must be thrown into the kettle, one at a time (the liquid will change color according to the recipe being used). %n%nFinally, a glass bottle must be used on the kettle to bottle the resulting brew, this must be done multiple times depending on the recipe.%n%nIt is important to keep the fire going constantly while the recipe is being prepared, otherwise it will be ruined. Swirls coming from the kettle is a sign all is well, black smoke (and brown liquid) indicates the brew is ruined. When a brew is ruined, the kettle must be emptied with a glass bottle, or just filled with more water, and the whole process repeated.%n%nWhen a brew is complete, the liquid will be the color of the resulting brew and will splutter (in addition to white swirls).%n%nSome recipes will require magical energy from a nearby Altar before they are bottled. If the brew is bottled when insufficient energy is available, the brew will be ruined. Black swirls coming from the Kettle is a good sign there is not enough power. A kettle must be within 14 (to 16) blocks of an Altar in order to obtain power from it (it can obtain power only from a single altar).

# Quest.337 - Don't shake it too much
gtnh.quest337.name=Don't shake it too much

# Quest.338 - Spirit coin transfer
gtnh.quest338.name=Spirit coin transfer
gtnh.quest338.desc=The Potion of Spirit can only made in the spirit world. Wondering how you can get your stuff like the Kettle, Spinning Wheel or Cauldron to the spirit world? Well you can bypass it probably on servers with the enderchests but for single player or a server without any enderchest you can transfer a few coins to the spirit world and buy some stuff. Don't claim the coins until you have already passed to the other side.%n%nYou have already collected a few coins in quests. Let's transfer them now and save it in a chest.%n%nIt's a repeatable quest so you can do it as long you have enough coins.

# Quest.339 - Circle magic
gtnh.quest339.name=Circle magic

# Quest.350 - A few more things...
gtnh.quest350.name=A few more things...
gtnh.quest350.desc=Ok, I think I have everything I need to assemble the device. Can you assist me with some additional materials? I need to update most of my machines, as these exotic components you got me damaged most of them already. Don't worry, I have a list here.%n%nMost of my circuits burned to a crisp while I was trying to measure the conductivity of these soul and life shards. I need better ones.%n%nGood lord, these mysterious crystals have eaten away my diamond grinding head! How could that happen? Can you get me a better one?%n%nDo you see that pile of chrome over there? No? Neither do I. Because the machine was VAPORIZED! Good that you gave me 2 singularities, the first one... Well... Just get me a better casing, would you?%n%nIt seems, that the stabilizers need... stabilizing... But I'm out of field generators. Can you help me with this?

# Quest.351 - Hello There!
gtnh.quest351.name=Hello There!
gtnh.quest351.desc=I've observed your progress, and I have to say, I'm impressed. I might need your help soon on a big project of mine.

# Quest.352 - Power. So much power!
gtnh.quest352.name=Power. So much power!
gtnh.quest352.desc=If only I could harness it... Well, hi there my friend. I need your help with a project of mine. I want to create an immense power source, but I have a few problems that I need to solve first. Will you help me? You will be rewarded.

# Quest.353 - A problem that matters
gtnh.quest353.name=A problem that matters
gtnh.quest353.desc=I need to open a wormhole. But for that, I need an immense gravitational field. One like those created upon the death of a massive star, a black hole. But I can't really "kill" a sun for this. I need to compress matter somehow... But... How? I think I may need a specialized machine for this, one that does not use explosions, as that won't get dense enough.

# Quest.354 - Now that matters!
gtnh.quest354.name=Now that matters!
gtnh.quest354.desc=Of course! The matter condenser! How come I didn't think of that?

# Quest.355 - I need a stabilizer
gtnh.quest355.name=I need a stabilizer
gtnh.quest355.desc=Opening the wormhole is one thing, but I need to stabilize it, so it doesn't harm anything. I guess I need something made of crystal. Why? Because I like it fancy. Find me a crystal-based, transparent material with immense power, would you?

# Quest.356 - Shiny!
gtnh.quest356.name=Shiny!
gtnh.quest356.desc=What in the world is this? This is amazing! I need more of these! They will be an amazing containment material for the wormhole!

# Quest.357 - I'm hungry
gtnh.quest357.name=I'm hungry
gtnh.quest357.desc=What... I work a lot! So get me some food please.

# Quest.358 - It needs a power plug...
gtnh.quest358.name=It needs a power plug...
gtnh.quest358.desc=Given the fact that I will be able to craft this device, it needs some kind of "plug" to get the power out. I need something to conduct immense amounts of power. I thought about superconductors, but they don't fit with the crystal casing material I have in mind. I need 2 different crystals, one for positive and one for negative charge.

# Quest.359 - Red and blue
gtnh.quest359.name=Red and blue
gtnh.quest359.desc=Really? A red and blue crystal? How awesome is that! I think I will need 8 of each color, just to be sure.

# Quest.360 - A casing
gtnh.quest360.name=A casing
gtnh.quest360.desc=I need something for the outer shell. Again, a crystal-based material would be best, because I like it shiny. I tested all crystals we know and none of them meet the requirements. I heard you have access to outer space? Can you try to find a suitable material while you're out there?

# Quest.361 - Fancy!
gtnh.quest361.name=Fancy!
gtnh.quest361.desc=Yes. Yes! That's it! Bring me more of this stuff! I probably need a lot of it...

# Quest.362 - Beyond imagination
gtnh.quest362.name=Beyond imagination
gtnh.quest362.desc=What is this? Draconium dust? I wonder if I could use this for something...

# Quest.363 - The power of dragons
gtnh.quest363.name=The power of dragons
gtnh.quest363.desc=Hey my friend. I got your sample, and I have to say, I'm amazed. This material has a lot of potential, but it's useless at the moment. I have an idea how to turn this into something useful, but I need you to help me with a few problems first.%n%nI need a good handful of that stuff for my research. Please get me some.

# Quest.364 - A hull
gtnh.quest364.name=A hull
gtnh.quest364.desc=First things first, we need a hull. I played around with your sample, and it seems that it reacts with every known material. It even attacks Iridium! It's completely harmless if it's in a box that is open, but as soon as I try to enclose it in something, poof. It breaks free. We need something stronger than iridium my friend.%n%nMaybe something from the core of a dead star....White dwarf won't be dense enough...Perhaps a Neutron Star? Hmmm...Yes, fetch me some ore from the core of a Neutron Star and we'll try some next steps.

# Quest.365 - Dense, denser, Neutronium
gtnh.quest365.name=Dense, denser, Neutronium
gtnh.quest365.desc=Now look at this. This stuff is incredibly dense. Maybe this material will be sufficiently strong?%n%nThis looks promising. Send me some samples, and I will try my luck.

# Quest.366 - Not a planet
gtnh.quest366.name=Not a planet
gtnh.quest366.desc=This place is interesting. Maybe I should try to find new materials here...%n%nWhat's that? Scanning shows some kind of new radioactive ore. Go and check it out, maybe hold some - with proper protection of course.

# Quest.367 - Successful.. Or not?
gtnh.quest367.name=Successful.. Or not?
gtnh.quest367.desc=Heh, neutronium. I didn't even know such a thing really exists. Unfortunately, the draconium dust was enclosed for... 5 seconds? But, it was a small success. %n%nOk let's travel to some planets and moons and look for the new material. I think we have to fly very far away for it.%n%nSomeplace dark, on a planet near the Kuiper Belt.

# Quest.368 - Black Plutonium
gtnh.quest368.name=Black Plutonium
gtnh.quest368.desc=This doesn't seem to be dense, but it's a material you haven't seen before. Maybe this could be the solution?%n%nBlack what? Huh, interesting. Send me some samples, I want to analyse it.

# Quest.369 - We have a hull
gtnh.quest369.name=We have a hull
gtnh.quest369.desc=Surprisingly, this material is able to contain the draconium dust. It could be the radiation. Good job my friend!

# Quest.370 - Draconium Dust core
gtnh.quest370.name=Draconium Dust core
gtnh.quest370.desc=I've created a first sample of what I shall call "Draconium Dust core". Not quite the result I expected to be honest, but see for yourself.

# Quest.371 - We need to control it
gtnh.quest371.name=We need to control it
gtnh.quest371.desc=The problem is that the immense power of this dust is released all at once. We need something to control the vast amount of energies. I noticed that the dust starts to glow when it gets near an aura node. Maybe Thaumaturgy has the solution?

# Quest.372 - The power of primals
gtnh.quest372.name=The power of primals
gtnh.quest372.desc=What else could control energies better than a focus of crystallized primal energy? With this little item, it should be possible to control the energies released from the dust.

# Quest.373 - Unforeseen consequences
gtnh.quest373.name=Unforeseen consequences
gtnh.quest373.desc=You haven't heard anything in a while from the technician. You have a feeling that something might have gone terrible wrong, so you went to his place to investigate. What you found was... nothing. A void. It seems that he tried to combine the pearl with the dust. What did he say? The dust reacts to aura nodes? Of course it does. It amplifies the energies by a thousand times. And giving it raw primal energy, good lord, what has he done. May he rest in peace...

# Quest.374 - I'm on my own now
gtnh.quest374.name=I'm on my own now
gtnh.quest374.desc=I need to continue my research. I still think that this primordial pearl is the key to control the dust, but I'm not sure how. Maybe the pearl is just too strong? I should try to use something that's similar, but less powerful. It reacts to vis, so maybe.. I should try to make a wand focus with that pearl. That way, I could channel vis into the dust without actually combining both.

# Quest.375 - An interesting material
gtnh.quest375.name=An interesting material
gtnh.quest375.desc=This metal has quite interesting properties. It seems that it has absorbed some of the energy that exists in the End. While ender pearls are quite fragile, this metal is a lot more durable. However, the absorbed energy is not enough to teleport things around. But you might find a solution for this.

# Quest.376 - Gross, what is that...
gtnh.quest376.name=Gross, what is that...
gtnh.quest376.desc=It's purple, and it smells like rotten eggs. But while staring at this unpleasant fluid, you had an idea. You can't reach the dust directly, but can you actually teleport something in and out the field? Might be worth a try.

# Quest.377 - An appropriate focus
gtnh.quest377.name=An appropriate focus
gtnh.quest377.desc=You've tried a lot, and nothing was quite enough to activate the dust. Until now. You finally found a focus that is able to transmit enough power to cause a heavy reaction with the dust, but not enough to cause problems.

# Quest.378 - Activated draconium dust
gtnh.quest378.name=Activated draconium dust
gtnh.quest378.desc=At least for a short period of time. The wand focus is powerful enough to activate the dust, but it will convert back to regular dust as soon as I stop feeding it with vis. If I only could contain it, surround it with a forcefield...

# Quest.379 - The strongest forcefield
gtnh.quest379.name=The strongest forcefield
gtnh.quest379.desc=In order to create a forcefield, I need to build myself a containment device. I will use only the best emitters I can afford. I will take no risks here.

# Quest.380 - Not what I expected...
gtnh.quest380.name=Not what I expected...
gtnh.quest380.desc=The outcome was... interesting. It did not explode, instead, the activated draconium dust generated a counter-field to mine! Unfortunately, the emitters could not stand the reverse energies, and melted. I was able to shut it off quick enough to save the machine casing (At least what's left from it...) And a couple of field generators.

# Quest.381 - Forcefield, second try
gtnh.quest381.name=Forcefield, second try
gtnh.quest381.desc=I came to the following conclusion: Draconium dust seems to react nicely with all kinds of magic energy, and seems to repel technology. So I need to find a way to create a forcefield with magic alone. There must be a way. This should be pretty similar to controlling dangerous nodes...

# Quest.382 - A magic force field
gtnh.quest382.name=A magic force field
gtnh.quest382.desc=While node stabilizers are too weak, you found a way to generate a strong containment field, generated by magic itself. You tried to use warded glass, but even the "frozen in spacetime" material could not resist the power of activated draconium dust. You decided to build another device, this time with your newest invention.%n%nThe vortex attenuator is powerful enough to negate even hungry nodes, and it also will be able to contain activated draconium dust.%n%nJust to be sure, I will add some amplifiers to it.

# Quest.383 - What the...?
gtnh.quest383.name=What the...?
gtnh.quest383.desc=The device works! It is able to fully contain and separate the draconium dust from everything around it! Unfortunately... It also prevents the vis from passing the barrier, which results in regular draconium dust... In a forcefield...

# Quest.384 - Looking for alternatives
gtnh.quest384.name=Looking for alternatives
gtnh.quest384.desc=It is frustrating. Either you are able to contain the dust but can't activate it, or, you activate it and it causes serious damage. Maybe you need to find answers somewhere else.%n%nDraconic... Like... Dragon?

# Quest.385 - Draconic... Like... Dragon?
gtnh.quest385.name=Draconic... Like... Dragon?
gtnh.quest385.desc=Maybe you where looking for the right things in the wrong place. As this dust obviously comes from dragons, the best thing to do now is to find answers in the dimension of dragons: The End.

# Quest.386 - Weird creatures
gtnh.quest386.name=Weird creatures
gtnh.quest386.desc=These ghosts are weird beings. But, I found this ectoplasm, which, by itself, seems to be pretty useless.

# Quest.387 - Activated teleport power
gtnh.quest387.name=Activated teleport power
gtnh.quest387.desc=By a random guess of yours, you combined molten ender pearls and a few more of these shards with an empty gem, and it turned blue. It is pulsating with power. You tried to use it on your containment device, and it seems to be able to bypass the force field, while keeping it intact that the same time. Sadly, it doesn't have enough power to let vis pass through. Maybe you can even further increase the gems power?

# Quest.388 - Arcane shards
gtnh.quest388.name=Arcane shards
gtnh.quest388.desc=While the normal world is based on vis and primal energy, the End seems to be quite different. This arcane shard is the crystallized form of this energy, just like the primal shards that you used so many times in the past. By pure randomness, you discovered that it reacts with the metal you've found.

# Quest.389 - Draconic evolution
gtnh.quest389.name=Draconic evolution
gtnh.quest389.desc=I found a way to combine technology and magic into something fantastic. A shiny blue emblem that emits immense amount of energy. I've decided to call it the draconic core. Make one for yourself!

# Quest.390 - Ichorium
gtnh.quest390.name=Ichorium
gtnh.quest390.desc=This new metal is quite expensive, and has an awesome hardness and is very resillient, to a point where mundane materials could never get.%nI think I can finally assemble the final frame.

# Quest.391 - Automated evolution
gtnh.quest391.name=Automated evolution
gtnh.quest391.desc=The machine is working pretty well, but it's tedious to fill in the reagents manually. But you have an idea, you could use a few basic components to fully automate the process.%n%nYou can use robot arms and conveyor belts to automate the input and output.%n%nObviously, you need to power the machines. A solar panel will do just fine.%n%nIn order to automate the catalyst, you need a few things. One golem will gather basic materials, while the second one will hunt creepers and ghasts for the more valuable ingredients.%n%nYou found a way to re-use the singularity, so you only need to get some sand. Luckily, the golem that works on the catalyst will be able to get glass too. He just needs a little additional motivation.%n%nYour golems need light, obviously. Also, it would be nice if there are some signal lamps that indicate the status of the process. Would it not?

# Quest.392 - Activated teleport gem
gtnh.quest392.name=Activated teleport gem
gtnh.quest392.desc=You are sure that you've just discovered the solution for your containment problem. This gem happily transmits vis on request, while keeping the containment field intact. What a great day!

# Quest.393 - You did it! But...
gtnh.quest393.name=You did it! But...
gtnh.quest393.desc=Now that you are able to contain the activated draconium dust for an infinite amount of time, you where able to assure the energy it releases. The readings are incredible. You have never seen such a power before. The only problem is, the machinery required to keep the dust in this state is too large to use it for crafting.%n%nYou noticed something that might help: The dust reacts to vis, but it needs a lot of it, therefore you require the animation focus. If you could find a catalyst, that you can mix the dust with, you could make the dust react with the vis from its surroundings instead of a direct beam.

# Quest.394 - A catalyst
gtnh.quest394.name=A catalyst
gtnh.quest394.desc=That's it. This catalyst contains all primal energies in a quite different form, a lot weaker than any node. However, in combination with the draconium dust, it amplifies the vis that's around it, which leads to a permanent activation. It still needs to be contained, but you don't need the direct vis beam any more.%n%nThe result is a compound, which still emits massive amounts of power, but is less destructive. It still attacks the neutronium, but I think if I can find a capsule-like container that has special properties, I could create a portable version of it.

# Quest.395 - Bulma would be proud
gtnh.quest395.name=Bulma would be proud
gtnh.quest395.desc=By combining a dimensional singularity with some glass cylinders and molten gold, I was able to create a miniature containment field within a very small area. Interesting enough, the new draconium blend amplifies the containment field from the inside. Once I fill the blend in the capsule, it immediately "seals" itself. I won't be able to remove or replace the dust any more, but I don't think I have to...%n%n%nThe perfect vessel for massive power!

# Quest.396 - The final steps

You can encourage animals to stay in pens (or at least not crowd the edges) by removing grass from around both sides of the fence (and under!) and placing a torch in the center of the pen.

gtnh.quest490.desc=Are you ready for a small trip? With your new lunch box, saddle, lead and of course a horse we can start a small journey. Be sure to make paths over water, horses don't like going over deep water.

# Quest.491 - §2§lSleeping outside
gtnh.quest491.name=§2§lSleeping outside
gtnh.quest491.desc=Carrying the bed with you all the time the looks very funny. Why don't you craft a sleeping bag to stay outside without placing a bed and changing your spawn point. This way if you die, you'll be right at home! Be warned: If you play on a server then you'd better sleep below Y level 128, as nights are very cold in the mountains...

# Quest.492 - §2§lSheep hairdresser
gtnh.quest492.name=§2§lSheep hairdresser
gtnh.quest492.desc=Killing sheep to get the wool is so ineffective. Making some shears would make sense if you need more wool.

# Quest.496 - §3§lHow to make rubber
gtnh.quest496.name=§3§lHow to make rubber
gtnh.quest496.desc=Making rubber is now more complicated - you need raw rubber and sulfur. Finding a sulfur vein in the Nether seems like a good idea, doesn't it? Found on Y level 5-20. Later on you can get sulfur from chemicals like hydrogren sulfide or pyrite.%n%n§4Sphalerite will be important later for gallium and zinc.

# Quest.497 - §4§3§lLit way to get charred
gtnh.quest497.name=§4§3§lLit way to get charred
gtnh.quest497.desc=You have found an alternative way of making charcoal with a "charcoal pile igniter". %nGo and start getting massive amounts of charcoal.

# Quest.498 - §2§lXP usage?!
gtnh.quest498.name=§2§lXP usage?!
gtnh.quest498.desc=Exploring some dungeons or fighting mobs probably gave you a lot of XP. Better use it to get iron, copper, tin or other useful dusts before you die during the next fight.%n%nPlace your tank on the ground and a drain on top. Now you can fill it with XP.%n%nBy the way, you discovered that while the seared tank doesn't hold much, it doesn't lose contents when broken, and full tanks can stack. I wonder if that information is useful...

# Quest.501 - Go find some bees
gtnh.quest501.name=Go find some bees
gtnh.quest501.desc=The next thing to do: Find a few bee hives around the world. There are 11 mundane bees that can be found, of which 8 are located in the Overworld. Any kind of bee will work for this quest.

# Quest.502 - A new home
gtnh.quest502.name=A new home
gtnh.quest502.desc=Now that you've destroyed the poor bees homes, you should build them a new one. The humble Bee House will not let your bees mutate into new species. But you'll need the combs anyways for better housing.  The production rate isn't too bad, but they cannot be automated.%n%nOne tip - Put some vanilla saplings near the Bee Houses. Bee Houses give a natural boost of 3x to pollination vs better housing. The bees will pollinate them and you might get lucky and start getting some Forestry tree crossbreeding. Stick with Oak and Birch trees, they'll give you a nice mix of starter Forestry trees.

# Quest.503 - Analyze them all
gtnh.quest503.name=Analyze them all
gtnh.quest503.desc=Every bee has multiple properties that define what the bee does, how it behaves in rain or at night, and a couple of other aspects. It is mandatory to keep track of those properties. This kit isn't very good since it doesn't give you information on their Inactive attributes, but waste not, want not.%n%nYou'll need to use paper to analyze each bee.

# Quest.504 - Scan or not to scan
gtnh.quest504.name=Scan or not to scan
gtnh.quest504.desc=In order to get into bee breeding, you need a way to see all the traits, active and inactive. You only want to breed so called "pure" bees; For those, both "Active" and "Inactive" traits are identical.

# Quest.506 - To play god
gtnh.quest506.name=To play god
gtnh.quest506.desc=In order to continue with bees, to mutate and breed them as you like, you need mutagen. This greenish, smelly liquid needs to be refined from bacterial sludge that seems to be available only on Mars. You will be able to continue, once you've arrived there.%n%nIn the meantime you can start working with the Genetics mod, since we all know Gendustry is too easy... Check out the recipes and you will understand why you should look into the Genetics mod.

# Quest.507 - Upgraded home
gtnh.quest507.name=Upgraded home
gtnh.quest507.desc=The Bee House can be used to stabilize mutations, for example if you have successfully bred two different bees, but the passive traits are different from the active ones. %n%nTo actually breed those together to get a new species, you'll need something different - the Apiary. Building them will require a Carpenter and Impregnated frames, along with Seedoil and Creosote - quite a bit of industrialization! Or, if you're lucky, you can find a beekeeper villager to trade with for useful items. Maybe you can help the villagers *get lucky* to make more beekeeper villagers? If only Cupid and his bow were around...%n%nProduction rates in an empty Apiary are low - lower than a Bee House by quite a bit, in fact.  But the Apiary has two big advantages - Frames, and Automation. You can now use your Untreated or Impregnated frames in here to boost output - and the boost is multiplied. So 3 x2 frames gives you 2 * 2 * 2 = 8x extra output!%n%nAlso, you should check the Slice and Splice tab for useful machines. The Acclimatiser can give very picky bees a much wider temperature or humidity tolerance without having to breed it into them.

# Quest.508 - Mutatron
gtnh.quest508.name=Mutatron
gtnh.quest508.desc=Mutations can be boring, they can be annoying, and most times, they are frustrating. With this machine, you will get a 100 percent pure bred mutation. If the combination of princess and drone can result in multiple mutations, the outcome is random. But who cares?%n%nYou can now upgrade your leftover Bees Advanced bags to Bees Expert in the last quest tab.

# Quest.509 - Genetic sampler
gtnh.quest509.name=Genetic sampler
gtnh.quest509.desc=With this machine, you can extract a random trait from any bee, sapling, butterfly or flower. The bee/sapling/butterfly/flower will be destroyed in this process. Each process requires an empty gene sample and some labware.

# Quest.510 - Diamondware
gtnh.quest510.name=Diamondware

By using this machine, you are able to copy any DNA sample, for the cost of an empty serum vial and some labware.

# Quest.513 - Advanced mutatron
gtnh.quest513.name=Advanced mutatron
gtnh.quest513.desc=A more advanced version of the mutatron. It uses more energy to mutate a drone with a princess, but the mutation is a 100 percent success, and you can select which mutation you want to have. This machine is a must-have for high-tier bees.

# Quest.514 - Blank gene sample
gtnh.quest514.name=Blank gene sample
gtnh.quest514.desc=To get the various traits from a bee, you need a lot of power, labware and an empty gene sample. You don't need a lot of those, as you can just throw them in a furnace to remove remaining DNA of traits you don't need or want. %n%nIn the meantime you can start working with the Genetics mod, since we all know Gendustry is too easy... Genetics is used for bees, trees, and Botany flowers so it gets its own quest tab. Gendustry is really good for bees, but will require top tier equipment.

# Quest.515 - Genetic template
gtnh.quest515.name=Genetic template
gtnh.quest515.desc=Templates are used to combine multiple gene samples into one large batch. It can be used to apply multiple traits at once, but you can also replicate a bee from liquid DNA and protein, if you manage to fill all 13 traits in one template. These templates can also be copied, just like the small samples.

# Quest.516 - A rather cruel disposal
gtnh.quest516.name=A rather cruel disposal
gtnh.quest516.desc=You probably will end up with a lot of excess drones while doing bees. (Or saplings if you do trees). Instead of throwing them away, you could also turn them into... Something useful.

# Quest.517 - Arnie's blender
gtnh.quest517.name=Arnie's blender
gtnh.quest517.desc=They say, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. This machine turns raw meat into liquid protein, which is used to create bees from scratch.

# Quest.518 - And there shall be light
gtnh.quest518.name=And there shall be light
gtnh.quest518.desc=Out of princesses to inject traits to? Too lazy to find hives and get more bees? Not a problem. With this nifty little device, you can use a ton of power, liquid DNA and protein to create any bee you wish to have. The only drawback is: All bees will be ignoble, which means they will die after a random amount of cycles.

# Quest.718 - §2§lMoron's Manual to Fecund Farms
gtnh.quest718.name=§2§lMoron's Manual to Fecund Farms
gtnh.quest718.desc=If you ever wanted to know how crop breeding works you are in the right place. Get some crops (the sticks) and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. %n%nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdWdFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd %nFFFdddFFF%nNow place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.%n%nWhen they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.%n%nWith some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.%n%nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel  or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.%n%nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds. %n%nIf you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.%n%nDon't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing. %n%nCrossing happens when 2 or more almost mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a 90 percent change of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation. More details in the IC2 cropnalyzer quest.

Use your scanner to scan all the seeds.%n %nSeeds can be planted again to breed better and more resilient crops.%n%nLater you can use your portable scanner to see the crop stats while still in the ground.%n%nGrowability depends on having dirt beneath your crop(4 max), biome (swampy is best, followed by jungle and mushroom - basically any humid or wet biome such as tropical rainforest or bayou), air quality (Up toY=124 and don't place a lot above/around your plants), hydration, and fertilizer.  When the crop tier and plant stats get high enough, they will actually die without enough Growability.%n%nAs long as you water and fertilize them, you can pretty much grow crops anywhere, but as you improve the stats you have to optimize their environmental conditions.%n%nIf the Growth stat gets too high, greather than 24 or so, the plant will spread weeds onto neighbors.%n%nSome crops, such as Redwheat, require certain light levels to crossbreed or grow.

# Quest.722 - Speed up your plant growth

gtnh.quest723.name=Potatos, Carrots, Pumpkins and Melons
gtnh.quest723.desc=Your seeds have three different values: Growth, gain, and resistance (GGR).%n%nThe only way to change a crop's GGR without 3rd party tools is through cross breeding. When two plants cross-breed, the resulting plant will have a GGR score that is between both "parent" plants' GGR. Sometimes it will also be a little bit higher or lower. Thus, to obtain high GGR scores you must go through numerous generations of crossbreeding.%n%nThe highest score for GGR is 31.

# Quest.724 - Weed

Without chips routed pipes can't do anything on their own, chips also have a GUI to configure them which can be opened by right clicking. %nThere are 8 types of chips:%n%n-Item extractor chip can be used to send items from its inventory to responder, dynamic responder, terminator and overflow responder chips in a pipe network. %n%n-Item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network which match the filter configured to the inventory connected to the responder chip. Chips with higher priority value will receive items first until the inventory is full then will be sent to other inventories with valid filters and remaining space.%n%n-Dynamic item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network that match items inside the dynamic item responder connected inventory. This chip has to be in the same interface pipe as the item responder chip in order to work. Priority rules apply here as well. %n%n-Item overflow responder works exactly the same as the item responder chip, however it only accepts items that cannot go to an item responder chip, dynamic item responder chip, or item terminator chip. %n%n-Item terminator chip works as a backup for responder chips.%n%n-Item broadcaster chip will show you the inventory connected to the routed request pipe on the pipe network and can be used to retrieve items from it. They can also extract from the side you configure. %n%n-Item stock keeper chip will constantly check the network for items and pull them to its pipe. If the chip is set to pull when empty, it will only pull if the inventory next to it is empty, otherwise it will pull when there are less items in the inventory than configured in the chip.%n%n-Item crafting chips craft things. %n%n-Item crafting extension chips are placed inside the item crafting chips.

A seismic prospector will tell you the ores in the surrounding chunk in a handy book you can read, and also the oil in the oilfields beneath each 8x8 chunks.%n%nTo determine which kind of oil or gas there is in the chunk you need to scan the soil by right clicking an Advanced Seismic Prospector with 2 Powderbarrels, 4 Glyceryl Trinitate cells, 8 iTNT or 16 TNT.  Make sure you wait a few seconds after placing the prospector before applying the explosives.%n%nThen use a Data Stick to extract the data by right clicking on it after the animation has finished.%n%nNow you need to put the analyzed data stick in a GT scanner. Then place it in the bottom right slot of the printer and add 3 paper in the top left slot and make sure you have at least 144 mb squid ink in it. (Only gregtech machines will work)%n%nAfter the process is done take the printed pages and combine it with a piece of leather in an assembling machine filled with at least 20 mb of refined glue. Don't assemble more than one book at time.%n%nTADA now you have a book with detailed info about the chunks you scanned.%n%nNote: Each oilfield is 8x8 chunks, and always on a by 8 chunk boundary. Within the field the amount can vary +- 25 percent. The amount reported in the book is the minimum and maximum per oilfield across all chunks in the field. The prospector reports on 3x3 oil fields at all tiers with the center oil field where the seismic prospector is located. Oil extraction rate depends on many factors, check the wiki for details. In general, anything above 300 is really good. The total amount in the chunk is complicated. %n%nOre locations are given as the center of the chunk. Ores that are marginal in that chunk may not be found in the center but on an edge. Look at where ores are located and determine the center of the vein. At higher tiers, it scans more chunks for ores.

# Quest.1115 - Moron's Guide to Taller Trees
gtnh.quest1115.name=Moron's Guide to Taller Trees
gtnh.quest1115.desc=Forestry trees have a variety of attributes.  Once you get a tree with a useful attribute, you can breed that attribute into other tree species. This way you can get an ultimate tree that combines all the attributes you want - including the type of fruit! These breeding lines do not cover every option or even the best, but are great starts to get you into Forestry.%n%nIT IS RECOMMENDED YOU DO YOUR FORESTRY TREE BREEDING IN AN ENCLOSED AREA, OR UNDERGROUND. BUTTERFLIES ARE A KNOWN LAG SOURCE.%n%nFor faster tree breeding, enclose your trees so that butterflies cannot escape, and breed bees with better traits for area and pollination.%n%nYou can search the traits below in NEI. The recipe for the Gene Samples will show you all trees that provide that trait. The quests here show you the easiest ones to complete.%n%nGirth - The width of your tree.  Wider trees have more leaves, but will also need more saplings to begin growing. All saplings must be the same species and girth. The sapling in the NW corner determines the stats of the new tree, and is where bone meal must be applied to mature the tree. Butternut already provides 2x2 girth.%n%nHeight - Controls how high the tree grows. Jungle trees are already Larger, but if you want Largest there is a guide to getting Cocobolo trees. There are rumors of rare villagers with Giant Sequoia saplings capable of reaching into the clouds...%n%nMaturation - The growth speed of a sapling into a tree.  Important if you plan to cut it down right away for logs.%n%nSaplings(NEI: Fertility) - Chance of getting a sapling from a detroyed leaf. Balsa, a tree on the way to Cocobolo, has High number of saplings. Good for making into biomass or other uses.%n%nSappiness - The amount of biomass a sapling produces in the Fermenter. Boost Fermenter output more using honey or fruit juice. Blue Mahoe provides the highest sappiness, but Lemon and Plum are respectable.%n%nYield - Chances of getting a fruit from a destroyed leaf. Plum is the best here.%n%nFruit - Each fruit from various trees provides different advantages. Lemons are great sources of Fruit Juice but don't provide much Mulch for the fermenter. On the other hand, Plum is a mediocre source of Fruit Juice, but great for Mulch. The best seedoil nut is coconut, but butternut or hazelnut are good alternatives.%n%nWhen breeding these trees for quests, you will need to breed the species "pure", not a hybrid.

# Quest.1116 - Breed some cultivated bees

Royal jelly is used to craft scented paneling which are required in the creation of alveary blocks.

# Quest.1123 - Alvearies
gtnh.quest1123.name=Alvearies
gtnh.quest1123.desc=The alveary is an advanced variant of the apiary. The alveary allows for combs to be produced faster due to its natural speed increase to production (as well as the ability to add up to six frames via the Extra Bees frame housings) and due to its ability to be modified by other blocks. %n%nIt is possible to adjust the internal temperature of the alveary using the alveary heater or alveary fan in order to accommodate bees that require hotter or colder climates.%n%nCertain bees will not produce their specialty items unless they are Jubilant. This requires matching their preferred Temperature/Humidity, without any genetic modifiers.%n%nIt is also possible to use mutators to increase chances of mutation, alveary lighting and alveary rain shield to allow bees without the nocturnal and tolerant flyer traits to work during the night and rain, respectively, and the swarmer to use excess royal jelly to create princesses that last for a limited number of generations.%n%nA submission station is recommended for quests with large amounts of items.

These are needed to run the Kinetic Wind Generator.%nOnce a Rotor is placed inside the GUI, the block is given sufficient space, and the current wind level is adequate for the current rotor, the Kinetic Wind Generator will begin to generate Kinetic Energy. %nThis can be converted into EU by using a Kinetic Generator attached to the correct face (the black circle).%nAbout Wind%nFirst off, the wind strength of a particular area is affected by 3 factors: Height, Weather, and Chance. The higher up in the world you are, the higher the wind level. Below y64, there is never enough wind to be used, and KWG's will not function at all. Weather will also give boosts; Rainy weather will give a 20% boost to normal wind levels, and stormy weather will give a 50% boost. The final factor of chance makes the wind strength vary randomly, however there is a limited range of variation.%nThe easiest way to check the current wind level in an area is by using a Windmeter.%nWind is strongest at around Y160, towards the build limit of Y255 there is very little wind, hence no point attempting to run Windmills that high.%nWhile inconvenient, the Wind Generator can run anywhere.%n%nYou will need to use NEI to see the recipe, since it use the Dire Crafting table. Make sure to put the items in the right place, or you will get a Water Generator instead.

# Quest.1139 - §9§lKinetic Water Power
gtnh.quest1139.name=§9§lKinetic Water Power
gtnh.quest1139.desc=The Kinetic Water Generator allows Kinetic Units to be produced via the movement of water in river and ocean biomes. As with the Kinetic Wind Generator, it requires either Gearbox Rotor. Search NEI for appropriate options.%n%nIf the Kinetic Water Generator's Rotor isn't entirely submerged in water, it will alert you there is "no room for the rotor". If the Kinetic Water Generator isn't placed in a river, ocean or deep ocean biome, it will alert you it "must be placed in a river or ocean biome". Check the Game Mechanics spreadsheet on Discord for a list of biomes and their tags.%n%nWhile inconvenient, the Water Generator runs more consistently.%n%nYou will need to use NEI to see the recipe, since it use the Dire Crafting table. Make sure to put the items in the right place, or you will get a Wind Generator instead.%n%n§4You can use Witchery to convert biomes.

# Quest.1140 - §c§9§lRotor

# Quest.1145 - §9§lHV EV Tranformer
gtnh.quest1145.name=§9§lHV EV Tranformer
gtnh.quest1145.desc=Gregtech cables will not connect to IC2 machines so you need transformers to convert the energy. The best way is building two transformers and a battery buffer to store the generated energy in batteries or energy cells. The longer the cable the more energy will be lost at low tiers. So use high tier voltages when transporting energy over long distances.%n%nBe careful; IC2 machines do not care about rain but your GT machines will explode violently if exposed to water.%n%nIt is also important to transfer the power up, not down, to avoid explosions if the rotor generates more than 120 EU/t. It is not recommenend to use better rotors than the iron ones on HV tier.

You don't need a plate or a foil to prevent pipes from connecting anymore.%n%nYou'll still want to cover hot pipes to prevent getting hurt!%n%nShift clicking on the end of a pipe will disable the fluid input on that side. This is super handy, for example, to prevent coal boilers from feeding back steam into water pipes. %n%nAlso, pipes now come with a shutter built in for free to reduce sloshing. Shift-rightclick with a wrench on the side you want prevent input.%n%nLarge or Huge fluid pipes can be a "poor man's" storage tank, holding large amounts on their own.%n%nFor machine outputs, including the boilers, and water siding tanks you will not need pumps. Other tanks will need pumps or Tinker's Construct faucets to move fluids.%n%nYou can put covers such as GT oak planks or plates on a pipe as well. Normally this prevents connections in that direction, but you can use a screwdriver to enable connections. This lets you make pipes that look nice going through walls.%n%n§4Hint: If you click one pipe onto the other they will auto-connect.

gtnh.quest1212.desc=Now that your power needs are increasing, you need a way to keep up with demand. To generate over 1A ZPM with a single machine you have two options: solars, and fusion.%n%nWhile solars are simpler to set up, solars cap out at 524288 EU/t. Fusion can reach levels close to eight times that with the right setup. %n%nFor your first reactor, you will need a controller, 2-16 fluid input hatches, 1-16 fluid output hatches, and 16 energy hatches. All hatches have to be LuV tier or better. Each hatch provides 2048 EU/t for the recipe, and has a storage capacity of 10M eu. %n%nThis means you can do any fusion recipe that takes less than 32768 EU/t or less, and has a startup cost of 160M EU or less. Using more fluid hatches means you need less fusion casings. While this doesn't matter as much for the mk1 reactor, this principle helps tremendously with the higher reactor tiers.

If you want to use a multiblock, things get complicated. You can use fixture mode and use a machine hull to buffer the items and fluids and then extract them, or you can use block mode, have the front go to a chest or input bus, and the other side(s) send liquid. If it uses more than one fluid in the recipe, it will do those until finished, then move on to the items. If you're not doing a processing recipe, use the ME Fluid Assembler.

# Quest.1306 - Extracting Items From the Network
gtnh.quest1306.name=Extracting Items From the Network
gtnh.quest1306.desc=The ME export bus extracts items from the ME network's networked storage and places them into the inventory it faces. You must configure which items it will insert, leaving the configuration blank will result in nothing. The ME export bus will try to export any of the items on its list skipping over those it cannot fit into the destination. This is the functional opposite of the ME import bus.

Each crafting CPU multiblock allows for a separate crafting job (this is different from from sub-tasks of the same job). The more items in the recipe and sub-recipes, the more crafting storage you'll need. Having one big and a couple small might be a good idea, but remember it will try to use the best one available first when you order a craft. They are also used when a crafting card requests a craft, so you'll need several separate ones if you intend to use those a lot. A crafting CPU multiblock uses only one channel, regardless of it's size. It must be square to form.

# Quest.1316 - 4k Item Storage Cell
gtnh.quest1316.name=4k Item Storage Cell

So if you have two EBFs that both want MV power, and you use a MV energy hatch, it won't work, since neither will get enough power. This is almost never used, so don't worry about it. Also, don't share inputs on Processing Arrays, they won't work.%n%nRemember pollution will be very high with two EBFs active at once!%nWatch out for high pollution effects. Use the best mufflers available and don't place the EBFs in the same chunk as farmland or other high pollution machines like pyrolyze ovens and large boilers.%n%nYou can use whatever coils you have lying around, but you might want to start searching for Mica if you haven't found any yet.

# Quest.1496 - §2§lHow the heck do I find ores?
gtnh.quest1496.name=§2§lHow the heck do I find ores?
gtnh.quest1496.desc=GregTech ore generation is based on veins. Veins are centered on orecenters, based on the chunk number. To find the chunk number, hit F3. In the X and Z lines you will see numbers like%nc: 3 (14)%nc: -2 (1)%n%nThe 3,-2 is the chunk's address. Ignore the negative sign.  Now, the orecenters are located at 3N+1 chunks.  So, 4,7 is an orecenter. 10,16. -22,19.  Etc. %n%nProtip: to find out if a number is divisible by 3, add the digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3.  So 86 = 8+6 = 14. So you need to go down 1 chunk or up 2 chunks so that you are on a 3N+1 chunk.%n%nFor reading all the way, I'll give you an ingot of iron.

# Quest.1541 - Analyze your crops
gtnh.quest1541.name=Analyze your crops
gtnh.quest1541.desc=The cropnalyzer is a powered tool used to analyze IC2 crop seedbags. Charge it by placing it in an MV machine; recommended to put an MV battery in it as well to keep it full. To fully analyze a seed bag, you will need to put it through the cropnalyzer four times. If the crop is already planted, it is better to analyze it with the portable scanner instead of breaking it just to scan it - you have a chance of losing the seed every time you break it.%n%nThe cropnalyzer also has a feature called the IC2 Crop Calculator, where you can find the mix of outputs of breeding together any crops. To access the calculator, hit the IC2 side inventory key while holding the cropnalyzer.  You can select any crop available and discover which crossbreeds have high chances.%n%nYou can choose up to four crops to breed together. Then click "process" and the bottom row will show the possible crossbreeding outputs, and their weights. You can use the + and - gui buttons to scroll through the row(s) of crops. You can also use a button in the GUI to sort the rows by tier or weight. You can invert the sorting by hitting the sorting button while holding shift.%n%nWhen trying to get a specific crop, you generally want to maximize its weight. But more specifically, you want to maximize the proportion of its weight out of all the weights. To determine the best crops to breed, look at their attributes.  Parent crops that share more attributes with a crossbreed increase its chances. This means there are no benefits to breeding 3 or 4 identical crops together instead of 2, since all weights are increased evenly.  %n%nUse the crops guide at https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-Crops for more details.%n%nTry a variety of combinations to get the crops you want. Often, breeding together two of the same crop is a surprisingly good option or even the best one.  A large field of stickreeds has a good chance at making lots of valuable crosses.

# Quest.1542 - Crop automation
gtnh.quest1542.name=Crop automation
gtnh.quest1542.desc=The Crop-Matron is a LV machine that will monitor crops in a 9x9x3 area and automatically apply fertilizer, Weed-EX, and Water as needed. Water can be pumped in directly or use IC2 Universal water cells, normal cells aren't returned when they are used.%n%nThe Crop-Matron is rainproof, but make sure you cover up your power supply (you might find a fancy way to do this), or use an LV battery.  A Lithium Ion will last about 2 hours.%n%nUse Weed-EX sparingly, since overuse will affect crops negatively. %n%nTilled dirt still requires a nearby water block to be hydrated as the Matron will only water the crop, not the soil. Try putting a lily pad on top so it isn't annoying to walk on, or using Garden Soil instead.%n%nYou'll need Stainless Steel to make the Crop Harvester.%n%nAs an alternative to the Crop Matron and Crop Harvester, you can make the Forestry Multifarm. It can also pick crops from cropsticks.

# Quest.1543 - Weed Ex
gtnh.quest1543.name=Weed Ex

You need to upgrade the energy hatch corresponding to the power tier. %n%nLater you can upgrade the ore drilling plant so it extracts from more than a 48 block radius. If you don't want to mine that far away, adjust the range with a screwdriver. Each tier of the controller also gives 1 bonus fortune for small ores starting at 4. At tier 3 you'll want to spread the wealth to multiple compressed chests!%n%nThe multiblock miners have been upgraded so that they will chunkload the area they dig in. They will NOT chunkload themselves, however. They will dig §odown§r in the chunk they're in like normal, and then dig §oup§r one chunk at a time in other chunks within its range.%n%nYou need mining pipes in the machine block and drilling fluid in the fluid hatch.%n%nYou'll need to make lots of Drilling Fluid. 64 is a tiny amount to get started with!

# Quest.1628 - Item overflow chip
gtnh.quest1628.name=Item overflow chip
gtnh.quest1628.desc=This chip stores the items in connecting inventory. It designates a storage for items that have no other place to go. It is strongly recomended to have a default storage for items in every pipe system, otherwise bad stuff can happen. Best used with some large chest (diamond one for example).%n%nIt seems to have some bugs though, so don't craft more than one without testing it first.%n%nYou might have to just use a normal item responder and add the items you want routed back to you overflow spot.

# Quest.1629 - Dynamic item responder
gtnh.quest1629.name=Dynamic item responder
gtnh.quest1629.desc=Dynamic item responder chip behaves exatly like an item responder chip, but instead of you setting up which items it should accept, it looks in the chest what items are there and those items it will accept.

# Quest.1630 - Item extractor chip
gtnh.quest1630.name=Item extractor chip
gtnh.quest1630.desc=This chip will extract items from the connecting inventory. The extracted items then look for pipes with item responder chips where there's a free space they could go.

gtnh.quest1631.desc=Item broadcaster is a chip that tells everyone in the pipe system what items it has in the connecting inventory and if anyone needs anything it will send it to them. Right click it to set the items it will transmit. If you leave it empty and set to blacklist it will transmit everything.%n%nDefinitely use one in combination with an item overflow chip on your default storage chest. That way overflow will end up in the chest, but will be useable by the rest of your system.

# Quest.1632 - Item stock keeper chip
gtnh.quest1632.name=Item stock keeper chip
gtnh.quest1632.desc=Item stock keeper looks at the connecting inventory and keeps item stocked in there. If the item is missing it will keep bothering item broadcasters every few seconds if they have the item and if they can send it. It's basically like an annoying child. %n%nIt is really useful though. Want a chest that will always have 64 cobble and dirt in it and if you take them they will get replaced? This guy is perfect for that job. It's great for keeping  machines stocked. When stocking GT machines, the top left slot of the 3x3 is equal to the left slot of the machine.  Want a chemical reactor that keeps 3 hydrogen cells ready to go to make ammonia, just add nitrogen?  This is the chip for you.

Use a machine controller cover on the controller (protip: You can put it on the bottom, or on the side next to a casing, casings will transmit redstone signal). %nWith a machine controller cover, you can use redstone to turn the machine on and off. This is handy if you don't want to use a soft hammer to disable a machine.%n %nThe best way to do that is with an RS latch. One input will turn the machine on, and one input will turn the machine off.%nUse a comparator attached to a valve to measure the steam level in your multiblock Iron or Steel Tank. Invert the signal to turn on your boiler when the steam level is low. When the steam level signal is high, turn your boiler off. Use a trail of redstone to lower the signal strength. Because of boiler/turbine warmup, try to set the ON strength to 30 percent of capacity and OFF strength to about 90 percent.%n%nRed alloy wire will hold a redstone signal for a longer distance.%n%nYou can use a Energy Detector Cover in Normal Electrical Storage (including batteries) mode to monitor the power in a battery buffer and use it to enable/disable generators in a similar way. Change mode using a screwdriver.%n%nYou can use MCCs on more than just generators though, you can use it on any multiblock. This is useful to prevent voiding of materials. If a non-GT++ multi is full, it'll void the items or liquid (GT++ ones will halt) and keep on truckin', potentially voiding huge amounts of materials. You'll want to use them in combination with Fluid or Item Detection Covers on the output hatch or bus.%n%nPS: You can use a Soldering Iron and Fine Soldering Alloy Wire to set the Redstone Output of a controller block to strong so it'll go through a casing (only casings!). Use with an activity detector.

gtnh.quest1764.desc=For this part we will learn how to use our adapter,  place it next to- let's say your EBFs battery buffer and connect it to the computer with cables.%nNow lets type in lua while on the computer to open the LUA environment where we can test things without worrying about saving and trying our program.%n%nType in 'component.list()'   this will display a table of all of .list from component.  What we're looking for is gt_batterybuffer.%nIf you have too many nearby things it may not display and the way to search the entire list of components is too advanced for starters.%n%nSo now assign a variable to it; for example 'a = component.gt_batterybuffer';  now we can call 'a' to see what methods the batteryBuffer has.%nWhat we'll be using in this example is the 'getBatteryCharge' method.  So type%n 'a.getBatteryCharge(1)' this will call the method getBatteryCharge from the first inventory slot on the gt_batterybuffer in component.%n%n So if we're using a 2x2 battery buffer; we can type something like- 'for i=1, 4 do print(a.getBatteryCharge(i)) end%nPoof you now see what all the batteries EU values.  Now what can we do with this?%n%nTry making a variable called 'batteryCharge = 0',  now do 'for i=1, 4 do batteryCharge = batteryCharge + a.getBatteryCharge(i) end'%n%nNow print(batteryCharge) will display the total charge. Here's a program example of this being used.%n%nPlace in your tape drive and type 'install', and follow the promps to install it into C.  Then edit it, test it, figure how it works.%n%nI suppose that's enough for now; congrats!  Experiment and learn, and don't forget to check google as much as possible!  %nThis questline will be updated again in the future; but I figure this is a good ending point for now.

gtnh.quest1853.desc=Welcome to the latest Moron's Manual, Effective EBFing!%nThis manual covers common problems encountered when using the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace.%n%nSetup%nWhen setting up your EBF, make sure to place it a few chunks away from where you will spend most of your time.  Pollution is nobody's friend!%n%nDuring setup, make sure the center of the EBF is hollow.  Sometimes things can sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft light orb!%n%nMake sure your muffler faces *out*, not *in*. The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those delightful odors!%n%nWhen placing your power hatches, make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF.  Especially at LV, those few meters make a big difference!  Every amp of energy travelling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you are poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top off the buffers generators. If you make 9 slot battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to get longer performance until you get stable power.%n%nOutput hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and inventories placed next to them.  They will also void if they are full, so keep an eye on them!%n%nWhen build multiple EBFs, the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace can share walls. This can save you on input and output hatches too.  Not recommended for energy and maintenance hatches!

# Quest.2007 - Quantum Computer
gtnh.quest2007.name=Quantum Computer
gtnh.quest2007.desc=One of the most incredibly complicated machines, this will serve as the main structure for your "Computation" generation for the Research Station. %n%nFirst, you'll need a few things: the Quantum Computer itself, The Uncertainty Resolver, some good circuits and the Computer Racks to hold them, and at least a UV energy hatch (UV 4A suggested). The QC will consume 1A of UV, and each CR will use one more. So another important factor is to ONLY turn on the Quantum Computer once you have the desired recipe for the Research Station ready to avoid excess energy loss. Remember to turn the QC on BEFORE the RS. In order for you to build this absolute monster, you'll need to place down the Quantum Computer at least 1 block above the surface/ground and use the Multiblock Machine Blueprint to see where to place everything. The blocks with no dots next to the vents indicate that that space must be empty.%n%nUncertainty Resolver:%nMuch like a puzzle-solving simulation, it is rather complicated to explain how to solve it, but it's often best just to retrace or undo certain actions and hope for the best. Sometimes, the Schrödinger Status will require some puzzle solving again after a period of time. This is random and incredibly frustrating, especially during operations being done between the Research Station and Quantum Computer(s), so it is important to constantly check the Uncertainty Resolver before you start operations on your Computer. If the puzzle looks too hard or you can't complete it, just remove it and the controller and re-place them to get a different puzzle.%n%nComputer Racks:%nThe main component within the multiblock to generate Computation. In order to achieve this, you will need to input some circuits and ic2 heat vents; Advanced Heat Vents work best. It is critical that you use Heat Vents to prevent the heat from reaching a catastrophic point, 55 percent or above should be avoided for safety reasons. Technically, you could achieve above 55 percent heat capacity or 5500 heat capacity, however the Computer Racks may melt or explode above 5600 or 6000 heat. You can see this for individual Racks by scanning them. You cannot remove or input components until the heat is gone. You can see the overall heat value in the controller's interface. And most importantly: DO NOT WRENCH THE COMPUTER RACKS IF THEY HAVE HEAT IN THEM. Otherwise, you're going to get an explosion.%n%nComputation:%nComputation is generated every second and is based on the tier of your circuit. There are, however, differences in between how much computation is generated, even with the same exact tier. For instance, you could use a Master Quantum Computer (Quantum Circuit Series / LuV) or a Wetwareprocessor (Wetware Circuit Series / LuV) which will give you more Computation even though they are of the same tier. If you wish to find out exactly how much Computation a circuit gives; place down a Computer Rack, put a circuit inside and scan it. You can also see the total computation in the controller.%n%nIt will include the following information.%nBase computation: %nAfter overclocking: <numbers, same as above unless you specially overclock it>%nHeat Accumulated: <numbers, based on circuits and heat vents, keep a watchful eye on this part as it's extremely important>%n%nUsing the Parametrizer you can overclock and overvolt, but you never need to, so you may or may not wish to try it.%n%nSending Computation to the Research Station:%nUse the Optical Master Connector in one of the variable spaces on the QC, and the Optical Slave Connector on the RS. Use Optical Fiber Cable to connect them, and make sure to paint all three.%n%nSuggested Build:%nNow that you've understood the concepts and safety of handling of the QC, what are the more optimal setups for your Quantum Computer? For now, I'll suggest 2 racks with 3 Ultimate Crystalcomputers each, and of course 1 Advanced Heat Vent. Do keep in mind that this 156 C/s setup can complete practically 3/4s of the recipes in the Research Station. This is a rather minimal setup compared to some of the more complicated setups.%n%nNow that you understand the QC, it's time to build it! You'll need to gather quite a lot of resources.

# Quest.2008 - Research Station
gtnh.quest2008.name=Research Station
gtnh.quest2008.desc=Now that you've started building up your precious Quantum Computer, how about the Research Station? Once again, using the Multiblock Machine Blueprint will tell you how to build this Multiblock. There should be 3 empty blocks beneath it so you can see the whole blueprint. Once it is nearly assembled, place down an Energy Hatch, an Optical Slave Connector, and a Maintenance Hatch all on the back side.%n%nOnce fully assembled, you can begin operating recipes at any time, so long as the Quantum Computer is also active and connected. The Research Station requires you to put the item to research within the Object Holder, then a data stick in the Multiblock interface. Once the Computation is fully completed, the data stick that houses all the data of the completed item will be inside the Multiblock Interface.%n%nStill confused? Good, that's the spirit of learning! Always make sure to test these things in creative single player if you wish to find exact measurements and such. Don't forget to ALWAYS COLOR THE OPTICAL HATCHES AND FIBERS!%n%n§3Note that some researches require a significant amount of amps, so keep that in mind.§r

gtnh.quest2014.name=§6§lAll those chunks, all in a row
gtnh.quest2014.desc=Sometimes you don't want a 3x3 area chunkloaded, but a long straight line instead.  This can be handy for rail lines or power lines coming from long distances.  An anchor sentinel can perform this function.  Right-click on a chunk loader with a crowbar, and it will activate. Go in any straight line from the chunkloader and place the anchor and hit it with the crowbar. Those chunks, up to 25x1, will now remain loaded.%n%nThis will draw an amount of chunkloader time relative to the 9 chunk area normally loaded. If for some reason you wanted only a 1 chunk area loaded, this will extend the time. Stock up on those pearls or server coins!

For instance you could have a variable that contains 2 chests. You use it in a nifty for each loop and later add another chest. Simply update the variable and the for each loop will start using it.%n%nStandard variables are able to be inserted into the middle of a workflow (it has input/output) and thus can be modified on the run.%n%nPlease note that for each loops will require a empty variable to work with. This is listed as "Element" in the loop.%n%nGlobal vs Local%nGlobal will keep changes to a variable that are done in the workflow, whereas local keeps anything done local to that part of the workflow.

# Quest.2020 - A magical box
gtnh.quest2020.name=A magical box
gtnh.quest2020.desc=This magical box is amazing. No matter how many are created, they all seem to connect to the same dimension.  I can store items in one location, and pull them out somewhere else! I can use dyes on the top of the box to assign its location, and any box with the same colors will share the same space. Using a diamond on the box locks it my mind, and a private network.  Shift-rightclicking will remove the diamond and join the chest back to the public network.

# Quest.2021 - A magical tank
gtnh.quest2021.name=A magical tank
gtnh.quest2021.desc=This tank always seems to connect to the same dimensional space.  No matter how many I create.  I can push fluids into the tank in one dimension, and retrieve them in a totally different dimension! I have discovered a way to assign a location to each tank using dyes applied to the top.  Using a diamond makes the tank private, attuned to the caster's mind, and will not share fluids with any other player's tanks. Shift-rightclicking recovers the diamond and makes the tank part of the public tank network. The dial on front controls the input/output of the tank. When blue is up, the tank accepts fluids.  When orange is up, the tank will eject fluids.

gtnh.quest2024.name=§c§lAssline quest updates
gtnh.quest2024.desc=When the pack updates and changes an assembly line recipe, your old data sticks become useless. However it's more than that, you can't simply rescan an old UV motor for the new UHV data, you need a new UV motor. It's best to start with component parts in the lowest changed tier, then work your way up until you've rescanned up to your current tier. Yes, this sucks, we also wish there was another way. You can tell if your data stick is out of date by seeing if the NEI recipe matches the one in the data viewer. NEI will always be right.

It guzzles amps though so your power infrastructure better be ready for it. The tooltip will list the performance boost provided. For block-based acceleration, the WA will do an area around it. For TileEntities like most machines, it will only accelerate the blocks directly touching the WA, and will need to be reconfigured with a screwdriver. This uses twice the power though.%n%nIf you want, you can change the level of acceleration by using a wrench on it. It will go back to the minimum, then increase one tier from there for every usage. It will use that tier's amount of power (and acceleration), increasing as per GT standard of 2x speed (acceleration) and 4x EU per tier.%n%n§3Even though it says 8A, this is just what it can accept, not what it uses. It's 3A in block mode, and 6A in TE mode.

# Quest.2161 - §3§lSafety first
gtnh.quest2161.name=§3§lSafety first
gtnh.quest2161.desc=For those new to GregTech, here are some tips and warnings about electricity. %n%nMachines don't like being out in the rain, and will start fires nearby.  Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending too high voltage to a machine will cause a near-instant explosion.%n%nSending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a wire does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.%n%nA generator that supplys 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than full voltage.  For example, macerators doing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run 4 or 5 off of a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.%n%nA single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.

There's even more that aren't included and you'll need NEI to find!%n%nHa ha, just kidding - don't panic! Once you unlock the bee breeding lines, look around and pick and choose which bees really interest you. The way the breeding is done is mostly left to right, and top down. Some of the lines at the bottom might look simple, but they will require bees further up to complete first. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown here.%n%nBees have two sets of traits, one that is Active that has effects on how the bee lives, and one Inactive but can be used for breeding. Some traits are §4Dominant§r, and some are §9Recessive§r. Keep this in mind when trying to breed in or out a new trait. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the targeted bee traits. You can breed the bees with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. You can't see the passive traits using a Field Kit, you'll need a Beealyzer. For lots of bees, you can scan them first using a GT scanner, but you'll still need a Beealyzer to see passive traits.%n%nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee.  A bee that has little or no crossbreeding potential, but has all the traits you prefer - short life, nocturnal, cavedwelling, rain tolerant, humidity, temperature, high fertility, etc.  Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.%n%nWhen you are trying for a new bee, what you are wanting is a drone - this way you can use your "breeding stock" princess for easy breeding, but the drone to get the new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poor crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown out if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Ignoble bees are good for this, since they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles - frames can let them live longer. Once you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die. Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine.%n%nOnce you get a new species, it will replace all of one of the two sets of traits of the bee.  For example when you get a Cultivated, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated! All the quests will require purebred species. %n%nGenerally all traits can be bred into any bee species, including effects or flower preference. Species generally require their preferred biome to produce their special drops.%n%nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances, or to lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for that pristine princess to become ignoble!%n%nIt looks complex, because it is! But it also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!

gtnh.quest2210.desc=Nuclear materials cause two types of radiation effects. One is a large number of standard debuffs.

Regeneration might delay the inevitable death, but most regeneration sources aren't fast enough or long enough to keep you alive. You can try using an Amulet of Remedium to get rid of the effects.

# Quest.2211 - Basic Bee Stats
gtnh.quest2211.name=Basic Bee Stats
gtnh.quest2211.desc=There are a couple of basic bees that have good stats you will want to breed into your breeding stock.%n%nCave Dwelling - Rocky - This lets you put the bee housing underneath or inside.

That means the bee is in its §lNATURAL§r preferred climate. So it must not be in a biome it can tolerate due to temp/humidity improvements. For example, a Salt bee needs Warm/Normal climate. Even if it has +- humidity and temp, it will not produce its Salt comb unless it is in a Warm/Normal climate. Use Alveary upgrades to make sure it is in its preferred temp/humidity.

Later quests will explain what that means.%n%nIf you don't want to see the IGI information, you can use %n%n§l/igi disable%n/igi enable%n§r%nto disable and enable the window.%n%n§l/igi config%n%n§rwill bring up the configuration window, which you can use to control placement, and the scale/size of the font.%n%n%nAnother useful display is Extra Utilities' TPS meter. It gives you the instantaneous tps, average tps, and worst-case tps. TPS is Ticks-per-second, a measure of how well your server is running.

# Quest.2407 - §3§lWhat engineer doesn't want a portable workbench?
gtnh.quest2407.name=§3§lWhat engineer doesn't want a portable workbench?
gtnh.quest2407.desc=This backpack sacrifices some space to give you a portable crafting table. You have to put the items you want to craft inside the backpack. Because of this, you can use it to quickly craft large amounts of items at once. %n%nLater you can use the Forestry Worktable with its larger inventory to do the same. Once you reach MV, you can switch to an Adventure Backpack that includes a pair of tanks for storing fluids.

# Quest.2408 - Controlling Your Drawers
gtnh.quest2408.name=Controlling Your Drawers
gtnh.quest2408.desc=Now that you have MV Circuits and Stainless Steel, you can make the incredibly handy Drawer Controller. This block will make any drawers it connects to in a 12-block radius (including the y-axis) part of a multiblock that allows storage (and retrieval with the right setup) to any of the blocks that make it up. This will allow you to dump the contents of your mining trip into a storage system much easier. Just hold right click on the Controller front for a second or two, and any items that match what's already in the multiblock will be deposited, while your tools and such won't. Just make sure to place your Controller last so it registers all the drawers.%n%nYou can feed into the Controller (and thus the rest of the drawers) with any kind of piping or hopper equivalent. If using it as part of a Multifarm or Mob Farm, make sure to set the contents of the drawers, and lock them with a key so that it properly stores everything in an organized manner. If the drawers' contents aren't set, it will start filling starting from the ones closest. If you wish to have more than one drawer full of an item, put a void upgrade on the drawer further from the Controller, and it will fill the first one, then the second.%n%nIf you want to go around corners, use the Trim Drawers to extend the multiblock. If you want to have a second point to dump items into, use the Slave Controller (one per multiblock, automation only). Note that you can use a key on the Controller to affect all drawers at once.%n%nYou can also use it with ProjectRed, see the appropriate tab for details.%n%nOnce you have an ME Network, place a storage bus on the Controller, and the entire inventory will be accessible from the network, with both storage and retrieval. Just remember to set the priority higher than your ME Drives. If you haven't locked them yet expect all your drawers to fill with random items from your ME Network.

# Quest.2409 - Even Rarer Earths
gtnh.quest2409.name=Even Rarer Earths
gtnh.quest2409.desc=Although you previously Centrifuged Rare Earth to get some rare materials including Cadmium, you believe your new Dehydrator can get you more materials than before. First, you need to use some Sulfuric Acid to melt off any impurities in a Chemical Bath, leaving you with Crushed Rare Earth (I). After that you need to process it like a normal ore until you get Rare Earth (I) Dust.%n%nAfter running the Dust through your Dehydrator, you get a number of strange materials, only some of which you recognize. But if you run these materials through an Electrolyzer or through the Dehydrator again, you may get some use out of them. Some of them may take quite a few to do so, but you §o§o§r§h§ohave§r been stockpiling, right? You'll need at least 409 Rare Earth, not counting losses in the Chemical Bath.%n%nYou believe if you had more powerful acids and machines, you could extract even more valuable materials out of the Rare Earth.

# Quest.2410 - Journey to the Center of the Earth
gtnh.quest2410.name=Journey to the Center of the Earth
gtnh.quest2410.desc=After acquiring your new pickaxe and clearing away a mountain or two, you wonder if maybe you should go...§odeeper§r. After trying it out on some Bedrock, you see a way down into the very depths of the planet. After exploring this new realm you make a note that it is:%n%nA) Seemingly empty of life%nB) Full of Bedrock you need to clear away with your new pickaxe%nC) Full of ore veins going up and down%nD) Some of these ores are strange and §odifferent§ §r from the ones you are used to%nE) Since Miners cannot break Bedrock, if you wish to use one, you'll have to do it for it first.%nF) After leaving you wake up on the surface somewhere nearby, your lack of memories of such is probably due to Oxygen deprivation. §oProbably§r. (After leaving the Bedrock Dim, you'll be thrown out somewhere nearby on what is hopefully the surface, and not inside a block, but no guarantees!)%n%nAmong the ore samples you seem to have brought back with you, you find a number of "basic" and "intermediate" ores and gems, as well as a few you don't recognize! Perhaps a return trip is in order?  %n%nAlso, you seem to smell like cheese for some reason?

# Quest.2411 - Fool's Gold
gtnh.quest2411.name=Fool's Gold
gtnh.quest2411.desc=After holding a Primal Charm for a while, you suddenly understand some of it's whispers! It tells of a land filled with untold riches, just waiting for someone to claim them. You scoff at the claim, but apparently if you "Open the Eye" and create a very fancy carved stone, you can create a portal there. But this eye it speaks of...just what is it? Maybe by delving into the darker realm of magic...bah! Only fools would believe such nonsense.

# Quest.2412 - Gen XXXXXXXXXX...
gtnh.quest2412.name=Gen XXXXXXXXXX...
gtnh.quest2412.desc=Yes! Yes! The eyes! You understand now, it is all too clear! The land of riches, it is yours! But what is this? It's empty? Why, where have your Riches gone? The sole inhabitant tells you that all such things have faded away long ago, with the End of Time at hand...But that simply means you're in the right PLACE after all! You're simply in the wrong TIME. If you simply adjust the portal a little, you can arrive at the right PLACE and TIME to get your well-deserved Riches. You suspect that such an adjustment would require something strong...INFINITELY strong.%n%nIn the meantime you now have a very very big closet to store your things in once the old owner...moves out. Upon leaving, you spot a tiny Ghast, surely just your imagination? Unfortunately the shifting of time causes you to end up in what is likely wilderness when you leave. (Exiting sends you back to the world spawn)

# Quest.2413 - The Darkness of Choice for Edgelords
gtnh.quest2413.name=The Darkness of Choice for Edgelords
gtnh.quest2413.desc=The madness that gripped you before has passed, but the idea for claiming the 'Riches' you thought of before still seems...reasonably sound. You'll need more than just something Strong though, you need something Hard, something Dense, something Unstable, and some magic to force it all together. You suspect you may need to upgrade your Infusion Altar for this, given the number of materials needed. You believe you can simply mine this new location for any ore you need from now on...%n%n§3Unfortunately, those tasty ores are locked beneath the mantle of the planet. You'll need to use a Void Miner to get them out.

# Quest.2414 - Too many items? Unpossible!
gtnh.quest2414.name=Too many items? Unpossible!
gtnh.quest2414.desc=Too many items getting you down? Just slap this badboy on a drawer, and any items you put in over the maximum will be automatically voided for you! More useful in combination with a Drawer Controller admittedly.

# Quest.2415 - Bringing the Biome to You
gtnh.quest2415.name=Bringing the Biome to You
gtnh.quest2415.desc=So maybe you can't find a swamp or tropical forest for your crops or bees, or maybe they're too far away so they're inconvenient to get to, or maybe your base is in a colder climate and you have to deal with the howls of direwolves constantly. Instead of packing up all your stuff and moving somewhere else, why not try changing the biome? There are a couple different ways to do so in this modpack:%n%nUse the Arcane Terrestrial Reformer from Witching Gadgets%n-Requires EV Circuits, Tungstensteel, Rocket Tier III%n-Also requires Infusion, Void Metal (sufficient warp), Energized Node for CV, lots of Essentia%n-16 block radius%n-Can only change to a few specific Vanilla or Thaumcraft biomes%n-Kind of slow%n%nUse Ritual of Gaia's Transformation from Blood Magic%n-Requires Void Metal, Infusion, Tungstensteel%n-Requires getting deep into BM (and the warp that come with it)%n-Requires 1,000,000 LP, Master Blood Orb, Tier 4 Altar and Awakened Activation Crystal%n-10 block radius, can be exactly specified with bloodstone bricks (either type)%n-Cannot specify which biome you get, you can only change the temperature/humidity within the 0.0 - 2.0 range and hope%n-Some biomes may be impossible due to limited range and overlap%n-Adjust temperature/humidity with items on 8 plinths around the Master Ritual Stone%n-Need to relog to see changes%n-Very little documentation or explanation%n-Fast%n%nUse the Brew of Shifting Seasons from Witchery%n-Small range, depends on the level of the brew (power, not dispersal extent)%n-Biome can be exactly specified%n-Crafted using the complicated custom brew system%n-Can add different ingredients to change range of the brew%n-At min changes a single block%n-At max has about a 3 block (circular) radius%n-Instant (once you use it)%n%nUse the Rite of Shifting Seasons from Witchery%n-Requires Stainless Steel, Greatwood Scepter or better for the Distillery%n-You have to do a bunch of witchery stuff%n-Not hard once you're done it once%n-Extremely large range, 16/32/48 block (circular) radius%n-Biome can be exactly specified%n-Sometimes fails in specific chunks%n-Very Fast%n%nIf you want to know how to use the Witchery methods, please go to the Look to the edges tab to continue.%n%nPSA: The IC2&Galacticraft Terraformers only change the surface, not the biome itself.

# Quest.2416 - Ghetto Biome Changing
gtnh.quest2416.name=Ghetto Biome Changing
gtnh.quest2416.desc=If you don't want to change the biome to a specific one, and just want a neutral environment for your bees, maybe using nodes is for you. You can try planting a Silverwood Sapling to get one with a pure node, or use other methods to move one.%n%nKeep in mind a 'bare' pure node won't change anything unless it has Victus. You can try use Sinister or Tainted, but...no refunds. These nodes have a radius of 11. To change the biome back, use an Ethereal Bloom (radius of 7). Keep in mind that both Pech and Wisps spawn in 'Magical' type biomes.

# Quest.2417 - Changing Biomes With Witchery
gtnh.quest2417.name=Changing Biomes With Witchery
gtnh.quest2417.desc=There are two ways to change biomes with Witchery, the easy way or the hard way, choose which one you want to do (or do them both). Remember that you need a Witchery Distillery first!

# Quest.2418 - The Easy Way to Change Biomes
gtnh.quest2418.name=The Easy Way to Change Biomes
gtnh.quest2418.desc=So you want the easy way? Ok, go get this stuff:%nMandrake Root, Nether Wart, Tear of the Goddess, Diamond Vapor, and a Diamond.%n%nThen toss it in the Witch's Cauldron IN ORDER, before also tossing in a page from the Book of Biomes (Extended) (craft it with a piece of paper while on the page of the biome you want), followed by a bit of Gunpowder.%nThen just use a bottle to get the brew. If wearing your Robes or Hat, you may even get more than one! (If you have a ton of brewing expertise, which is unlikely)%n%nIf it failed, you may not have enough Altar Power, you need 5450 at least. Try placing down a Dragon Egg or Demon Heart if you're close. Check a wiki for more details on altar power.%n%nIf you want to have more than a single changed block, then add Glowstone Dust, Blaze Rod and Attuned Stone (Charged) in order to increase the effect (and Altar Power cost slightly) by +1 for each. Do this before adding in the page.%n%nFor more detailed info, check out the Witches' Brews book. Click on Brewing, then go to the Brews: Step-by-step page. This should tell you what you need to know. For what each of the brews actually does, see the Effects page. Only Effects use Capacity, and you can have multiple.

# Quest.2419 - The Hard Way to Change Biomes
gtnh.quest2419.name=The Hard Way to Change Biomes
gtnh.quest2419.desc=Ok, to have a ritual with a size greater than zero, you need to get Coven Witches to acknowledge you and then agree to help you out. To get them to deign to speak with you, you can either infuse yourself or bind a familiar. In this quest line we'll be covering binding a familiar, but for the people who want to do infusion, you just need to make the appropriate item: Ghost of the Light, Soul of the World, Spirit of Otherwhere, or Infernal Animus, and do the appropriate Rite of Infusion. Be sure to have a Death Protection Poppet to protect you, because the ritual kills you. If playing hardcore, definitely test in a separate world first.%n%nTo bind a familiar, first, summon a Demon and tear out it's heart. No, seriously, go do it. Use an Arthana with Looting III for the best chances. If you don't know how to summon one, refer to page 49/50 of the Circle Magic book for the correct Rite of Summoning.%n%nYou'll need a Mutating Sprig for the next part.

# Quest.2420 - More Hearts for Valentines
gtnh.quest2420.name=More Hearts for Valentines
gtnh.quest2420.desc=If you want to get more hearts, you can try trading with the Demon, but they're more likely to shoot fireballs at you than trade. Unless you have this item that is! First, make the Polynesia Charm that allows you to trade with animals (probably not worth it in this pack), then use the demon heart to make the Devil's Tongue Charm. With this, not only are they a lot less likely to attack, they will even sell their brethren's hearts for a little less.%n%nJust remember that it can only be used a limited number of times, ok? It might also be worthwhile to use the Rite of Protection at the same time as summoning a demon. To do so just put down both circles, and meet the item (and Altar Power) requirements of both. If you're not planning on killing the demon, you should probably send it back when you're done with the Rite of Banishing on page 47/48 of the Circle Magic book.

# Quest.2421 - Are You Grassping What I'm Telling You?
gtnh.quest2421.name=Are You Grassping What I'm Telling You?
gtnh.quest2421.desc=To make Grasspers, first you need to arrange Grass in the cardinal directions around a Chest above a block of water. Then right-click the Chest with your Mutating Sprig.

# Quest.2422 - PETA Approved*
gtnh.quest2422.name=PETA Approved*
gtnh.quest2422.desc=To make Critter Snares, first you need to arrange Alder Saplings in the cardinal directions around a Cobweb above a block of water. Then get a zombie to walk onto it and right-click the Cobweb with your Mutating Sprig.%nThis will change the Saplings into the needed Critter Snares. Do this twice. (*May not be PETA approved)

# Quest.2423 - Mad Science is the Best Science
gtnh.quest2423.name=Mad Science is the Best Science
gtnh.quest2423.desc=Next we need to fill our snares up with some critters, specifically Bats and Slimes. For the Bats, just place them beneath you and AFK if your warp is high enough to spawn bats, otherwise...uh, go caving?%n%nFor the Slimes, if you can't find any just use the Maze Slimes from the Minoshroom maze in the Twilight Forest for this. After you get them, also go collect a Wolf and an Ocelot (Lassos or Soul Vials are great for this).%n%nNow we'll be creating new life, specifically Toads and Owls. Arrange a Cobweb above a water block with grasspers at the diagonals and one of the two sets of snares in the cardinal directions. Place Attuned Stone (Charged) in all 4 Grasspers. Then place one of the two animals in the center and right-click with your Mutating Sprig like when making the snares. Use the Wolf with the Bats, and the Ocelot with the Slimes. The tamed versions also work.%n%nCongratulations, you've defied the natural order and created new life! Hopefully they didn't run away because you created them outside :(%nMake sure to breed them for the next part. Use Raw Porkchop or Raw Beef for Owls, and Rotten Flesh for Toads to both tame and breed them.

# Quest.2424 - Finally Binding a Familiar
gtnh.quest2424.name=Finally Binding a Familiar
gtnh.quest2424.desc=Now that you have Toads and Owls, you can choose between them and Cats to bind. Why didn't we just bind a Cat earlier? Well, you'll need them both soon anyways, and who doesn't love choices? To carry out the Rite of Binding (P6, Circle Magic), you'll need to distill some Demonic Blood. Do that now, and collect the rest of the items needed.%n%nAfter collecting the items, bind your familiar using them. Make sure you have enough Altar Power. Remember that each has different benefits. See the official wiki for details. You may receive a tiny portion of damage your familiar receives (and vice-versa), so park it somewhere safe. Also note that if it dies, so will you (Supposedly). You can resummon it if it dies or was dismissed previously (like if you died). If you're in hardcore mode and don't want to risk having it around, it can be dismissed by right-clicking while sneaking when it's sitting.%n%nNow go murder a few of your new friends and tear of their Owlet's Wings, and cut off their Toe of Frog. Remember to use an Arthana. The next step needs a Seer's Stone.

# Quest.2425 - Greenhouses on Mountains, Hell on Earth
gtnh.quest2425.name=Greenhouses on Mountains, Hell on Earth
gtnh.quest2425.desc=You're almost there! To actually use the ritual, you need to recruit a coven first. Find some Coven Witches and complete their quests:%nThe means to control the dead -> Necromantic Stone%nThe beating means to master the infernal dimension -> Demon Heart%nI must perform many curses, bring me the necessary brew -> Brew of the Grotesquex5%nI desire to predict the future -> Crystal Ball%nOr just fight something.%n%nOnce completed, they'll disappear until you need them. They will sometimes appear near your spawn point if you walk by it, so don't position it over lava or something, since they CAN die and reduce the number of your coven. You can have 6, with one extra appearing for Cauldron work. Consider keeping some extras around in a dungeon just in case.%n%nAfter you recruit your coven, you just need a few things for the ritual itself: Spider Eye, Toe of Frog, Wool of Bat, Tongue of Dog, Owlet's Wing, Attuned Stone, and Attuned Stone (Charged).%n%nTo specify the biome, look in the Book of Biomes, and find 1) the type (Forest, Plains, etc), and 2) the number. Type determines the foci used, and number determines the amount of Glowstone Dust used to get that specific biome. Make sure to pack up a ritual circle into a circle talisman so you don't have to redraw it, and bring some cobblestone to make a flat area (15x15, any height). Try not to do it at night unless you like dealing with infernals.%n%nTo actually do the ritual, have the ritual circle on the ground, the items (including the foci and Glowstone) in the circle, and right-click the center with the Seer's Stone.%n%nThe area affected is determined by the number of witches in your coven. It's 16 * (size of coven - 3) radius in a circular area, so 16/32/48 if it doesn't fail.%n%nUnfortunately, sometimes after logging out and back in again you may find that it didn't work correctly in specific chunks, this is (possibly) due to lack of chunk updates and it not saving the changed biome ID correctly. Just redoing the ritual doesn't really help, you'll just get patches in the same places, however placing water after the ritual and before logging out may help with this. Or use chickens. Lots of chickens.%n%nAlso, if you already have crops in the area, they'll disappear until a block update or relog.%n%nPSA: To pack your circle back up, you need to bring your altar with you.%n

# Quest.2509 - AE Spatial Storage
gtnh.quest2509.name=AE Spatial Storage
gtnh.quest2509.desc=Contains up to a 2^3 area inside it. This is 8 blocks, so if you just want to teleport yourself, you don't need to make the later ones.

# Quest.2510 - AE Spatial Storage
gtnh.quest2510.name=AE Spatial Storage
gtnh.quest2510.desc=Contains up to a 16^3 area inside it. This is 4096 blocks.

gtnh.quest2515.name=Centi-vis in your network
gtnh.quest2515.desc=You can use this device to either transfer the contents (CV) of a Vis Relay to another vis relay, an Arcane Assembler, or an Arcane Crafting Terminal. Either way, place the relay on the device (and send some CV to it), and use the memory card to link to the second device. If you send it to another Vis Relay Interface, you'll obviously need another Vis Relay on the other side.

# Quest.2516 - Storing Essentia in Jars? Why again?
gtnh.quest2516.name=Storing Essentia in Jars? Why again?
gtnh.quest2516.desc=So apparently you can attach this to a void/oblivion jar and have it void overflow if you set the priority low. Neat, huh?%n%nWhat? Store essentia in jars? Seriously? I guess you could, if you really wanted to, or if there were new, larger jars...

# Quest.2517 - Magic Terminals
gtnh.quest2517.name=Magic Terminals
gtnh.quest2517.desc=The Arcane Crafting Terminal is the terminal version on the Arcane Workbench. It can hold a set of vis discount gear in it's inventory in addition to a wand.

# Quest.2519 - Illuminated Panels
gtnh.quest2519.name=Illuminated Panels
gtnh.quest2519.desc=All terminals are made from these. You'll probably want several.

# Quest.2520 - Making the Assline Easier
gtnh.quest2520.name=Making the Assline Easier
gtnh.quest2520.desc=Unlike regular pattern terminals, the processing pattern terminal doesn't have a crafting mode. Instead, you have a 4x4 space for more items, one more slot for output, and the ability to swap them.

# Quest.2521 - Making Patterns Quick
gtnh.quest2521.name=Making Patterns Quick
gtnh.quest2521.desc=The Pattern Encoder will allow you to use NEIs shift-click ? button functionality to create a crafting pattern even if you don't have the appropriate items.%n%nHowever, you can also drag the items from NEI to do the same thing, though much slower, because you have to look up each component. This is vastly less useful for processing patterns, since it's always 64 items though.

# Quest.2522 - Visualizing How Much Your Stuff
gtnh.quest2522.name=Visualizing How Much Your Stuff
gtnh.quest2522.desc=The ME Storage Monitor allows you to visualize how much of an item you have. For example you can tell if you're running low on circuitsand should make more, or how a long crafting process is proceeding. There are a couple of ways to use them.%n%nRightclick with item: Will display the current level of that item if not locked.%nRightclick with empty hand: Will reset the display if not locked.%nRightclick with AE2 wrench or network tool: Will toggle the lock.%n%n%nThe ME Conversion Monitor is the upgraded version of the ME Storage Monitor.

# Quest.2529 - Beam Me Up, Scotty
gtnh.quest2529.name=Beam Me Up, Scotty
gtnh.quest2529.desc=If you want to teleport stuff around using these, you'll need a drive in the SIOP, and at least 6 pylons hooked up. The pylons need to indicate the X, Y and Z dimensions, with you needing 1 more than you would think. If the efficiency goes below 100%, the AE cost will balloon enormously, so add more pylons to counteract that. After using a redstone signal to activate the SIOP, the blocks will be moved to the spatial IO dim, and the drive will move to the output, so you can send it somewhere else. This is very important to do properly if you want to use it as a teleporter. Otherwise you can get stuck there. Your network will need to be able to hold all the power needed to teleport at once, so you'll need at least one energy cell. You can only have one Pylon setup per controller, so consider putting them on a subnetwork.%n%nUsing 2 in the X and Z dimensions and 3 in the Y will give you a 1x2x1 teleporter to teleport yourself. You'll want a SIOP port on each side for sending and for receiving. But you'll still need to design a redstone contraption to activate them properly!  %n%nRead this if you want to know more about spatial IO in general, and larger setups: https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/3c2b2r/a_treatise_on_nocheat_smp_ae2_spatial_io/%nAlso see this if you want to see a fancy teleporter: https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/2mhrf8/ae2_spatial_transporters/%n%n§4Spatial cells, once used, will only work in the XYZ dimensions first used, with no way to format or recraft. Test in creative first!%n%nExpect your world to lag for a second after using, blame AE.

# Quest.2530 - Spring Cleaning
gtnh.quest2530.name=Spring Cleaning
gtnh.quest2530.desc=So, when you first started AE, maybe you dumped a bunch of your items into 1k drives, but now you want to clean them up, or empty them to reuse them in making higher tier ones. The ME IO Port will allow you to fill or empty your drives by connecting to the rest of the network.%n%nYou can use the Cell Workbench to format your drives, so they'll only contain the stuff you want. Remember, more item types mean less space overall. You can set them to lapis for example, then put them in the ME IO Port with the transfer direction to the drive to fill it with only that item. Don't put in an unformatted drive while using storage drawers to store tons of stuff! If you want to move your stuff around, put in new drives, then empty old ones, or disconnect your storage drawers temporarily.%n%nYou can use the Workbench to format fluid drives too, and even use cells instead of buckets.%n%nCell Workbenches do not connect to the network, so they don't need a channel.

# Quest.2531 - Formatting Gas-er, Essentia
gtnh.quest2531.name=Formatting Gas-er, Essentia
gtnh.quest2531.desc=This is the essentia version.

# Quest.2532 - Alpha and Omega
gtnh.quest2532.name=Alpha and Omega
gtnh.quest2532.desc=The ME Annihilation Plane destroys blocks as if you had mined them, and places them into the network. The Identity version acts as if silk touch was used.%n%nThe ME Formation Plane does the opposite, it places blocks into the world. You'll need to tell it what to place/drop though. This can work in both block and item mode.

# Quest.2533 - Fluid Placement
gtnh.quest2533.name=Fluid Placement
gtnh.quest2533.desc=Did you know that dispensers with a bucket will place or pick up fluid blocks in front of them after receiving a redstone signal? Well, this is the technological version. Remember it'll only work on fluids that can be placed down, ok? This is different from whether there's a bucket version or not.

# Quest.2534 - Moar Patterns!
gtnh.quest2534.name=Moar Patterns!
gtnh.quest2534.desc=You may have noticed that the ME Interface's GUI is different that before. That is because with this card you can have more patterns, adding 9 more per card up to a total of 36. HOWEVER, it also uses 4 times the energy for every item when crafting, and this is multiplicative for each new card. If doing large crafts, make sure you have some dense energy cells ready.%n%nSo basically: (sum of amounts of items in the pattern) * config multiplier (which is 10 for GTNH). with cards, it's also multiplied by 4^(number of upgrades)%n%nE.g. recipe (wood log -> planks) in the interface w/o upgrades would draw: 1*10 AE units, that is 5 EU (remember 1 EU = 2 AE)%n9 charcoal -> charcoal block compressor recipe in the interface with 3 upgrades will draw 9*10*4^3*0.5 = 2070 EU, but only 45EU without any cards%n%nThey're kind of expensive, so consider holding off if you can't afford the material or EU costs. If you remove it, all hte extra patterns will pop out, so be careful of that when moving your stuff.

# Quest.2535 - Singular Singularities Signify Something
gtnh.quest2535.name=Singular Singularities Signify Something
gtnh.quest2535.desc=Quest names are hard sometimes, ok? To make a Singularity (for the Quantum Network Bridge), you'll need to dump 512,000 items into the Matter Condenser set to Singularity Mode, while using a 64k component or higher.%n%nThen put the Singularity and Enderpearl Dust on the ground and use an explosion (Tiny TNT works well) to create two Quantum Entangled Singularities.%n%nQESs are each a unique pair.

# Quest.2536 - Quantum Bridging Your Outposts
gtnh.quest2536.name=Quantum Bridging Your Outposts
gtnh.quest2536.desc=A Quantum Network Bridge allows you to connect faraway places to your main AE network, even in other dimensions. So you can shove that pollution producing Mega EBF in the Void where it belongs, but still use it from the safety of your main base. To create this, you'll need a Quantum Link Chamber surrounded by Quantum Rings. Then put an Quantum Entangled Singularity in the link chamber, and connect to one of the 4 Quantum Rings around it with a fluix cable. They cost 1000EU/t for each pair.%n%nYou can power the other side from the first, but you need to jumpstart it first, so bring an energy cell when setting it up. Remember that it's part of the same network, so you can only have one controller, and you're still limited by the channels of the cable you connected with, so you may wish to use the P2P Tunnel to bring more across.%n%nIf you use several, you may wish to rename the QESs.

# Quest.2537 - Tools of the Trade
gtnh.quest2537.name=Tools of the Trade
gtnh.quest2537.desc=The Network Tool is AE2s main utility tool.%n%nRight-click on a network to see the power usage, and what makes up the network.%nRight-click on air to interact with it's inventory to store cards or turn facades transparent.%nShift-right-click to remove fixtures (import bus, interface, etc) that don't take up a full block without removing the cable, or remove any AE block immediately the same way.%n%n%nThe Network Visualizer does exactly what it says, it allows you to visualize the channels of your network. First, right-click a network to select it. At first you'll see everything, but you can change the modes by holding shift and scrolling the mouse wheel up or down to see different things. Remember that if you have a subnetwork, like one that P2P tunnels go through for example, those nodes won't show up since it's a different network, but the P2P tunnels entrances and exits will. This goes through solid objects, so you can look at your whole base.

# Quest.2538 - Portable Digital Storage
gtnh.quest2538.name=Portable Digital Storage
gtnh.quest2538.desc=They're exactly what they sound like. %n%nThe first is for items and acts like a terminal. It can hold 4,032 of a single item.%n%nThe second is for liquids, and acts like the fluid terminal. It can hold 128 buckets of a single liquid.%n%nIt costs AE to put things in, take them out, or have the interface open. Use the Wireless Charger from EIO if you don't want it to take forever.

# Quest.2539 - Deck of Cards
gtnh.quest2539.name=Deck of Cards
gtnh.quest2539.desc=These cards add additional functionality to certain devices or fixtures. They specify what devices they work on in the tooltip.%n%nThe Redstone Card adds redstone interactivity to the devices it can be used on, with the following options:%nAlways active, active with or without redstone signal, activate once per pulse.%n%nThe Capacity Card adds more slots for items that use them. If you add this to an Export Bus, an icon is added to select item priority.%n%nThe Crafting Card allows you to automatically request autocrafting of items.%nIn an ME Interface, if you put in items to be stocked, if there aren't enough, it'll craft them until it reaches the selected amount. Remember that these are being stocked for crafting recipes that the ME Interface has. If you want them to be seen by the network, you'll need to put a storage bus on the ME Interface.%n%nIn an ME Level Emitter, in the first mode, it'll emit a redstone signal while the specific item is being crafted. In the second, it will emit a redstone signal once a crafting job for the item has been requested, but§4§r §4it won't send the items to be crafted.§r This is useful if you're using a dummy pattern, and are using the level emitter to tell something else to happen. You still need to get the item(s) requested back into the system so it doesn't tie up a crafting CPU though.%n%nIn an ME Export Bus, it'll attempt to send whatever item(s) are selected in the export bus' GUI. In the first mode, it'll send available items first, then create crafting jobs for the rest. In the second mode, it will only send crafted items.%n%nThe Acceleration Card makes the device/fixture work faster. You'll probably want a lot of these.%n%nThe Inverter Card allows you to invert the item filter of certain fixtures.%n%nThe Fuzzy Card allows you to apply fuzzy logic to filtering to allow items with different NBT or damage data to be counted as the same. This is different from metadata. If you just want it to be fuzzy for nbt, set to Match Any. If it is set to 99%, it will work on anything that is damaged. You can use the Inverter Card to reverse this.

# Quest.2540 - Tools of the Trade
gtnh.quest2540.name=Tools of the Trade
gtnh.quest2540.desc=The ME Fluid Auto Filler will add crafting recipes for any fluid in your network that has a bucket version. When crafting a water bucket for example, it will send a bucket to it, and the filled water bucket back.%n%nThe ME Fluid Assembler acts like a combined Molecular Assember and ME Interface for recipes that require fluids (but not processing recipes). It will accept both buckets and cells in the recipe patterns, but doesn't use them when crafting, it just sends the fluid directly. The MEFAF is sad :(.

# Quest.2541 - Wireless 1.5
gtnh.quest2541.name=Wireless 1.5
gtnh.quest2541.desc=You can add different terminals (fluid, essentia) to the Wireless Terminal to make the Wireless Universal Terminal. However... essentia doesn't work, and crafting only works if the crafting terminal was used as the base.

# Quest.2542 - Wireless 2.0
gtnh.quest2542.name=Wireless 2.0
gtnh.quest2542.desc=This is the good wireless terminal. It even has crafting. There's a bit of lag when you open it, but the convenience it worth it, right? You can't pull out fluids, but you can hold on to the universal one if you want.%n%nThe Magnet Card does not pull items to you. Instead, it allows you to automatically deposit them into the network. You can right-click to change the white/blacklist, or shift-right-click to change the mode.

# Quest.2543 - Wireless 3.0
gtnh.quest2543.name=Wireless 3.0
gtnh.quest2543.desc=This upgrade allows unlimited range. You don't even need a Wireless Access Point!%n%n§4Extremely buggy, unfortunately. May randomly disappear, or fall out of the terminal at any time.

# Quest.2544 - Cut the Power!
gtnh.quest2544.name=Cut the Power!
gtnh.quest2544.desc=The ME Toggle Bus allows you to cut off access through a cable if it doesn't receive a redstone signal. The inverted version is, well, inverted. It must be placed between the cables, like a Quartz Fiber.

# Quest.2545 - Providing Essentia on Demand
gtnh.quest2545.name=Providing Essentia on Demand
gtnh.quest2545.desc=The Essentia and Infusion Providers both do basically the same thing, send essentia to a device that requests it for crafting.%n%nThe Essentia Provider needs to be next to the device, it's mostly for the Thaumatorium. Since it's effectively a magic ME Interface, you can also use it instead of an Essentia Import Bus next to your Alembics or the Advanced Alchemical Furnace.%n%nThe Infusion Provider is for devices that draw essentia through the air, like the Runic Matrix (infusion) or Overchanting Table. It doesn't need to be next to the device.%n%nThey both obviously need the essentia they request to be accessible by the network to work.

# Quest.2546 - Ordering Essentia
gtnh.quest2546.name=Ordering Essentia
gtnh.quest2546.desc=The Distillation Pattern Encoder allows you to automatically melt down items in your alchemical furnace to provide essentia.%nFirst, place something that is already scanned in the device, along with a blank pattern. You can create the pattern by clicking the button, or click the different aspects to select one that is not the highest. This will create a pattern of item -> essentia. Then use an ME Interface pointing at a furnace with the pattern in it. You can now craft that type of essentia the same way you would a normal craft, but through the Essentia Terminal.%n%n§4There isn't a way to have the system craft essentia on demand for a craft unfortunately.§r%n%n

# Quest.2547 - Autocrafting Magic Stuff
gtnh.quest2547.name=Autocrafting Magic Stuff
gtnh.quest2547.desc=The Arcane Assembler works like a combination of the Molecular Assembler and the Arcane Workbench, allowing you to autocraft anything crafted in the latter. You need to link a vis relay through the network to supply essentia to it, and a Knowledge Core with recipes on it for to work. Additionally, you can add vis discount gear into the interface to take advantage of the discount. The base discount starts at 20%. For each Acceleration card, the time taken will reduce by 20%, and increase power used by 50%. For every point of warp on the discount gear, the power costs increase by 15%.%n%nThe knowledge core holds up to 21 patterns for use in the Arcane Assembler, but you need a new assembler for every knowledge core if you want to autocraft more than that.%n%nTo encode the patterns, you need a Knowledge Inscriber. It works exactly as you would expect. It doesn't connect to the network, so it doesn't need a channel. If you want to erase a pattern select it and the save icon should become erase instead.%n

# Quest.2548 - Miscellaneous AE Items
gtnh.quest2548.name=Miscellaneous AE Items
gtnh.quest2548.desc=There are several AE items that aren't particularly useful, but probably deserve mention, so here they are:%n%nCertus Tanks: They hold 32B and are portable and easy to make.%n%nView Cell: Format in a Cell Workbench to filter what you see in a terminal (when they're installed in it)%n%nCertus/Nether Quartz Cutting Knifes: Right-click to open interface. Place an iron ingot in the slot, and choose a name. The press can be used in the Inscriber to name stuff without using an anvil.%n%nME Drive Fixture: Only holds 6 cells instead of 10.%n%nME Energy Cell Fixture: Requires a channel for some reason. Also, §4it doesn't work.§r%n%nME Block Container: Holds only one type of item, but the amount of a 64k drive. Can place the item in world, or replace in a 1x1 or 3x3 area. Blocks replaced will be dumped in world. This will be horizontal or vertical depending on which side of a block you select. Shift-right click air to change mode, right click a block to activate mode.%n%nCharged Quartz Fixture: Emits light at the same level as a torch, but fancier.%n%nLight Detecting Fixture: Emits redstone signal based on light. Since it only starts at 7, it's not as useful as the Light Sensor.%n%nME Upgrade (Tier 1/2/3): If you're an OC person, there's 3 upgrades you can make to add access to your network from robots and drones.%nT1: 0.5 access point range%nT2: Normal access point range%nT3: Unlimited range, any dim%n%nEntropy Manipulator: Changes grass/dirt/dried dirt into each other, or starts fires. Or melts ice. Useless.%n%nMatter Cannon: Shoots Matter Balls made in the Matter Condensor. Put it in an ME Chest or Drive and put items in a Terminal to fill. Decent I guess? But it destroys blocks every time you use it, so... Well, I guess you could use it with Paint Balls?%n%nColor Applicator: Use dye items or Paint Balls (more efficient) to dye stuff. You can dye cables, or anything Forge-compatible, like wool or glass. Place items inside like the Matter Cannon. You can cycle through the colors by holding shift and right-clicking, or scrolling the mouse wheel. If you use snow balls, you can remove paint instead. You can also use it in a dispensor.%n%nME Fluid Pattern [WIP]: §YYou're supposed to use it in a fluid terminal if there's no bucket version of a fluid to be able to make a crafting pattern with that fluid. However, §4it doesn't work.§r Also useless since we have cells.%n%nWalrus: It's a walrus, what are you expecting?

# Quest.2563 - §6§lSievert for the Vat
gtnh.quest2563.name=§6§lSievert for the Vat
gtnh.quest2563.desc=Some Vat recipes require a certain Sievert (radioactivity) value. So attach this Radio Hatch to your Vat to input radioactive material!%n%nThe Radio Hatch holds rods/long rods of radioactive material and uses them to produce Sievert. The input item determines the Sievert value and how long it lasts. Items stored in the hatch will be used continuously even if machine not active, so make sure you want to craft something before putting items in.%n%n§rYou can check the stats of an inputted item with a portable scanner. Higher tiers of hatch hold more, from 1kg (HV) to 6kg (UV). Rods are worth 1kg, while long rods are 2kg.%n%nSome recipes require §4exact§r sievert, you can use the screwdriver to access the radiation shutter control to adjust how much sv is blocked from being sent to the vat. For example, you need 100sv to make SeaweedBroth, so you'd use Naquadah rods, and block off 30sv.%n%nRod Stats:%nMaterial-Sievert-Apprx. time until used up%nBismuth                 83sv   198s%nUranium 235           92sv    80s%nUranium 238           92sv    80s%nPlutonium 239         94sv    66s%nPlutonium 241         94sv    66s%nNaquadah             130sv   14.5s%nEnriched Naquadah 140sv   10.5s%nNaquadria            150sv     8s%n%nThere are more radioactive materials than these, but these are the main ones.

# Quest.2564 - §6§lMaking the Vat More Efficient!
gtnh.quest2564.name=§6§lMaking the Vat More Efficient!
gtnh.quest2564.desc=Looking at the Vat's recipes you are likely discouraged by the small amount of fluid being produced per recipe.%nDon't worry! Fluid consumption and production shown in NEI are just the base line for the lowest efficiency. The efficiency of Vat depends on the amount of fluid in the Output Hatch.%n%nThe efficiency gradually increases as the output hatch fills up and reaches maximum efficiency when it is §cexactly half-filled§r. If the hatch fills even more, the efficiency goes down again, so try to keep it close to half! At maximum efficiency the amount of fluid consumed and produced per recipe is multiplied by 1000. The items and culture are not affected.%n%n§TThere are different means to keep it at half, including OC (not SFM, it doesn't like BW fluids), fluid detector+machine controller, or a fluid regulator, as well as more off the wall ones such as frames or block-sharing. If you choose the fluid detector route, remember that using a larger output hatch will make it easier to keep it close to half-filled.

gtnh.quest2600.desc=To make the Circuit Assembly Line imprints you'll need a bunch of new materials.%n%nTo start, let's get some raw materials, Prasiolite, Cubic Zirconia, and Tellurium.%n%nYou also need some other materials, but I don't need to explain those, do I?%n%n§3If the materials are too much of a pain, you can replicate some of them once you have one of it.

# Quest.2601 - §c§l§6§e§6§lCircuit Assembly Line
gtnh.quest2601.name=§c§l§6§e§6§lCircuit Assembly Line
gtnh.quest2601.desc=You'll need all of these to create 4 CALs, enough for a single series of circuits. If you only want one (for the microprocessors for example), just divide by 4.%n%nAssuming you got the necessary imprints on the LuV tab, you can now craft the CALs for the crystalprocessor series. We're starting with 4 since you'll need one per circuit, the imprint is not removable. And yes this means you need one for every circuit type you want to make with the CAL.%n%nAs an Assembly Line, it generally works like the normal one, with different items in each bus, but since it's only one item per CAL, it's far easier to use and make.%n%nThe CAL uses 'wraps' to make 16 of a circuit at a time (aside from ULV and LV circuits), saving you time, EU, and Soldering Alloy. You make the wraps in an Assembler with 16 of the item and Polyethylene.%n%n§3BTW you can change out the Input Hatch and the Energy Hatch, but the I/O busses need to be ULV.

# Quest.2602 - §c§lImprints, They're Important
gtnh.quest2602.name=§c§lImprints, They're Important
gtnh.quest2602.desc=Now that you've finally gotten all the materials to make your imprints, you can make them as you get your new circuits. You'll need to slice the circuits for the imprint in either a tier-appropriate slicing machine, or the Cutting Factory in slicing mode.%n%nTo use the imprints, place them in the CAL controller's item slot. The CAL will be imprinted once you turn it on. You can see what it's imprinted with by using a portable scanner on the controller. You can also swap out controllers if you're too lazy to make more CALs.%n%n§3If you already have an imprint for them, you don't need to make another, it works with both recipes.%n%n§4Because of the way oredicting and recipes work, slicing LV or HV circuits in the Cutting Factory will not work properly, so use at least an HV slicing machine for those.

# Quest.2603 - §c§lFetching Tellurium
gtnh.quest2603.name=§c§lFetching Tellurium
gtnh.quest2603.desc=For Tellurium, you can do it these ways:%n%n1) EBF Crushed Lead Ore for 2 Tellurium Nuggets%n2) If you have old worldgen, you can get it from Temagamite practically anywhere (it was broken so it currently doesn't generate), or Mercury if it's been fixed%n3) Make Rare Earth (III) out of Rare Earth using the strongest of acids and get it from Alburnite%n4) Toxic Everglades again

# Quest.2604 - §c§lFetching Cubic Zirconia
gtnh.quest2604.name=§c§lFetching Cubic Zirconia
gtnh.quest2604.desc=For Cubic Zirconia, you'll need to combine Zirconium and Yttrium Oxide in the EBF as well. Fortunately you only need the dusts.%n%nYou can get Zirconium from:%n1) The Red Zircon ore on Ross128b <- Do this one%n2) Sifting Cassiterite, Tin, or Ilmenite <- Do this one if you hate Ross%n3) Chemical Bathing Tin or Rutile with Chlorine%n%nOxygen isn't hard to get, but the Yttrium more than makes up for it. You have a couple options:%n1) Centrifuge Rare Earth for a 1 -> 25% chance for 1/4 of a dust%n2) Make Rare Earth (I) out of Rare Earth (see the MV quest) and get it out of Xenotime%n3) Make Rare Earth (II) out of Rare Earth using a stronger acid and get it from Yttriaite%n4) When you have a T6 rocket, you can pick some Yttrium ore up from Triton, making you cry at how much easier it is%n5) In ZPM you can try going to the Toxic Everglades to grab weird GT++ ores, some of which have Yttrium in them (Yay RNG ore worldgen!)%n%nTo get Rare Earth you §ocan§r use Redstone or Skystone, but you can also get it out of Monazite directly or some other ores as a byproduct. Hopefully you saved it up?

# Quest.2605 - §c§lFetching Prasiolite
gtnh.quest2605.name=§c§lFetching Prasiolite
gtnh.quest2605.desc=For Prasiolite you'll want to put Quartzite and Amethyst in an EBF to get Flawed Prasiolite. You'll need to either use the Implosion Compressor or Precision Laser Engraver to up the quality to Exquisite. You'll also need the dust version as well, so don't convert them all.%n%nFor the amount of Amethyst you'll need, you'll want to make a stop on Venus.%n%nIf you have a T5 rocket, you can get the ore from Ross128ba directly and run it through the sifter.

# Quest.2606 - §c§lRNG is Definitely Good Game Design
gtnh.quest2606.name=§c§lRNG is Definitely Good Game Design
gtnh.quest2606.desc=Once you've collected all the materials, you'll need to make Magneto Resonatic Dust and Circuit Compound Mk3 in a Mixer.%n%nCombine these in the Forming Press to make Raw Imprint Supporting Boards.%n%nYou then craft those into Imprint Supporting Boards in an Autoclave in a Cleanroom with Soldering Alloy. Unfortunately, there's only a 75% chance of succeeding, so I had you collect extra materials. You can use the leftovers for your next imprint.

# Quest.2607 - §c§lNaquadah Alloy
gtnh.quest2607.name=§c§lNaquadah Alloy

gtnh.quest2621.name=Superconductors at 2,097,152 EU/t
gtnh.quest2621.desc=So above this is the UEV, UIV, UMV, UXV, and OpV wires. Only UEV and UIV have cable versions, and there are no superconductors. You can use UHV superconductors, or use a super cheap material and accept some losses to move your power around. Aside from other options like sending it through an AE tunnel or making power on site again.%n%nThe materials to make the higher tiers are currently Draconium, Nether Star, Quantium, Black Plutonium, and Awakened Draconium. Expect these to change if the tiers actually see use.%n%nWhat, the UHV superconductor? Didn't you already make that?%n%n§4If you forgot, you get a heat adjustment when using the EBF based on energy hatch tier. So you can smelt the Base UHV Ingot with Fluxed Coils and an UV hatch, since you get up to 10501K. And no, you can't use a Volcanus or MEBF.

# Quest.2624 - Tier IX Field Generator
gtnh.quest2624.name=Tier IX Field Generator
gtnh.quest2624.desc=I wonder if they're circles because they're basically just wrapped wire, there's certainly enough of it in there.%n%nBTW there's one tier higher than this, but it's not really useful. And this one's only really used for optional stuff anyway.

There are also 3 recipes, so you can use a higher tier one later if you like. You can also make liquid Growth Medium the same way. The vat way is more item-efficient, but more complicated.%n%nYou'll also need Mince Meat and Agar. You'll want a stable supply of meat, so something like the Zhuhai, a standard animal farm, or ic2 Meatrose or Goldfish is probably best.%n%nAgar has a more complicated processing chain, but it's nothing compared to Platinum. You'll need even more meat for it.%n%nUse some of the Bacteria to create an Ova Evolutionis culture (15% chance), and then use that in the vat's controller to make Raw Growth Medium.

gtnh.quest2663.desc=The Bioprocessor Assembly is the second Bio Circuit. It is a UV-Tier circuit.

# Quest.2664 - Supercomputers... with Cells?
gtnh.quest2664.name=Supercomputers... with Cells?
gtnh.quest2664.desc=The Bioware Supercomputer is the third Bio Circuit. It is a UHV-Tier Circuit.%n%nIt needs a TecTech Research Station at 4,000,000 EU/t (8 amps of 500,000 EU/t).

# Quest.2665 - Master of Circuits
gtnh.quest2665.name=Master of Circuits
gtnh.quest2665.desc=You have done it! This is the final (normal) circuit in the game!%n%nThe Bio Mainframe is the first and only UEV-Tier Circuit in the game. It requires a TecTech Research Station at 16,000,000 EU/t (16 amps of 1M EU/t).%n%nAlso, there's this thing called going outside. I heard you may like it.

# Quest.2666 - Magneto Resonatic Circuits
gtnh.quest2666.name=Magneto Resonatic Circuits
gtnh.quest2666.desc=So, you may have been looking through NEI and seen a line of purple circuits from BW and wondered 'What are these, and when can I make them?'. Well, I don't know why they exist, but you can make them starting now!%n%nThey all use Imprint Supporting Boards, a type of crystal (change the dust to crystal with Neon or Krypton in an Autoclave, and then move up tiers with the Precision Laser Engraver), SMDs, and a §3circuit of the previous tier.§r So the material cost increases rather dramatically. They're made at a power tier +1 of the circuit's tier, so IV ones are made with LuV voltage.%n%nYou can even make UHV circuits if you're crazy enough! The UIV CA has no recipe, so you can't make the UEV ones, unfortunately.

# Quest.2667 - Moar Powa!
gtnh.quest2667.name=Moar Powa!
gtnh.quest2667.desc=So Helium is great and all, but have you tried Tin? Bigger and better fusion means greater power demands, not to mention all your other devices, so it might be time to upgrade.%n%nGood turbine options at this point are: small Trinium (larger ones will produce too much and cause an explosion, explosions bad), large Draconium, large Neutronium, large Oriharukon, and large Ichorium.

# Quest.2668 - Something From Nothing
gtnh.quest2668.name=Something From Nothing
gtnh.quest2668.desc=Void Miners are basically the same thing as regular ones, except that they draw from the whole pool of ores for the dimension without there having to be any nearby. In addition, you can speed them up by supplying Neon, Krypton, Xenon, or Oganesson.%n%nYou can get Neon reasonably easily from Bartimaeusnek Ore from Ross 128ba. Krypton and Xenon can be produced from centrifuging fuel rods. All three can be produced from the EV liquid air distillation method. Remember you need the Liquid Air Fluid Hatch to actually put in enough liquid air. If you want all the produced gasses from the first 4 slots, you'll need to use the Giant Output Hatch.%n%nTo get Oganesson, you'll need mk3 fusion.%n%nAll four fluids can be replicated, so you'll probably end up doing that.%n%n§3If you want the Deep Dark's ores, you HAVE to use a Void Miner.

# Quest.2669 - Wasn't This Only Found in the Center of Neutron Stars?
gtnh.quest2669.name=Wasn't This Only Found in the Center of Neutron Stars?
gtnh.quest2669.desc=You'll need Neutronium for UV and the T7 rocket, so let's make some.%n%nTo get Neutronium, go to one of the planets that has the small ores. Then mix it with Helium Plasma to make Raw Neutronium Dust. It can be smelted in a Blast Furnace at 9000K and 491,520 EU/t. This recipe takes a long time and a lot of power. Better make another EBF or Volcanus. Or a few. Or upgrade your Mega Blast Furnace.

# Quest.2670 - Which Doctor? THE Doctor
gtnh.quest2670.name=Which Doctor? THE Doctor
gtnh.quest2670.desc=If you haven't made one before, go check out the quest in MV linked from the Robot Arm about how they work. This one gives the maximum boost, 256x, and uses between 1.5M-3M EU/t, so make sure your power grid can handle it, or dial it down.

# Quest.2671 - Data Bank
gtnh.quest2671.name=Data Bank
gtnh.quest2671.desc=By now you probably feel overwhelmed with the number of data sticks needed for your assembly line. TecTech has a solution for you: The Data Bank. It allows you to store more than just 16 data sticks and can be connected to multiple Assembling Lines at the same time.%n%nPlace the controller one block above the ground and use the Multiblock Machine Blueprint to see how it is built. You will need a Maintenance Hatch and at least an EV Energy Hatch, though the power requirements can be much higher if you use many Data Access Hatches and Data Bank Master Connectors, so you might as well go for an LuV energy hatch, which will power a maxed one. Trying to run the Data Bank and then scanning the controller will tell you how much eu/t is needed.%n%n§rYou will need more blocks then what is asked for in this quest, as the number of Data Access Hatches and Connectors is up to you. You can have a maximum of 15 combined.%n%nThe Assembly Line Slave Connector replaces your old Data Access Hatch on the Assembling Line. Connect it to a Master Connector on the Data Bank with Optical Fiber Cable and make sure to color the hatches and the cable.%n%n§3If you can't figure out what blocks to place, pay attention to the tooltip in the bottom-left when using the Blueprint. In this case the filler blocks are Computer Casing.

# Quest.2672 - Unlimited Power
gtnh.quest2672.name=Unlimited Power
gtnh.quest2672.desc=With this new fusion reactor your new power option is...wait, Tin? Still? Well, this is embarrasing. Still, you could try other stuff if you want I guess? Remember that the Plasma Generator runs on Plasma, so only fluids with it in the name will work, even if they're made in the Fusion Reactor.%n%nFor turbines, you could try large/huge Trinium or large/huge Cosmic Neutronium.

# Quest.2673 - Neutrons From Space
gtnh.quest2673.name=Neutrons From Space
gtnh.quest2673.desc=Now let's make Cosmic Neutronium, a material that is used in a lot of late game stuff.%nCentrifuge Black Plutonium to get a Pile of Neutrons. It can then be compressed to Cosmic Neutronium Nuggets in an Implosion Compressor.%n%nCompress the nuggets again to make a Cosmic Neutronium Ingot.%n%n§3Avaritia's Neutronium and GT Cosmic Neutronium are oredicted together, it's not the same as normal GT Neutronium. It goes back to being called SpNt if you craft it into something, like a plate.

# Quest.2674 - Compressing the Core of a Star
gtnh.quest2674.name=Compressing the Core of a Star
gtnh.quest2674.desc=The next material is Infinity Catalyst. Infinity Catalyst needs to be compressed with insane amounts of force. The only machine capable of doing that is a Neutronium Compressor. Let's make one.%n%nTo make the Catalyst, go to Vega B to get the dust. Then use the Neutronium Compressor to make Infinity Catalyst with 64 of the dust.%n%nYou can also do the insane Avaritia recipe to make the Infinity Catalyst, if you want a challenge :P%n%n§3The compressor can also be used to make singularities, culiminating in the Eternal Singularity, used in the alternate recipe.

# Quest.2675 - One Ingot, Infinite Power
gtnh.quest2675.name=One Ingot, Infinite Power
gtnh.quest2675.desc=Here at Questbook, Inc. we are seriously worrying about your health if you got here legitimately. Playing this much might be bad for you. You can always go outside, you know?%n%nBy the way, to make the ingot, it's just a simple Dire Crafting Table recipe. Remember that you were the one that chose to be here.%n%n§3A number of endgame recipes have now opened up. Check the Endgame Goals tab or NEI recipes for the Table to see what they are.

# Quest.2676 - Collecting Neutrons the Alternate Way
gtnh.quest2676.name=Collecting Neutrons the Alternate Way
gtnh.quest2676.desc=Now that you have Infinity, you can use the Avaritia Neutron Collector to get Piles of Neutrons. It does not use any power.%n%n§3Warning: This machine is extremely slow, so you might want to use something to help with that...

# Quest.2677 - No, It Won't Repair Your Car
gtnh.quest2677.name=No, It Won't Repair Your Car
gtnh.quest2677.desc=The Auto Maintenance Hatch will correct maintenance problems immediately at the cost of some materials. Invaluable if you want to make sure your cleanroom machines won't void stuff. Or you could just use a howler and do it yourself I guess.

# Quest.2678 - Paint-by-Numbers
gtnh.quest2678.name=Paint-by-Numbers
gtnh.quest2678.desc=If you want to color all those fancy cables and such, you'll want to use the humble Paintbrush. To uncolor them, use a bucket of water.%n%nAlternatively, you can also use the IC2 Painter, GT Spray Can, or the AE2 Color Applicator.

# Quest.2679 - It produces HOW much power?
gtnh.quest2679.name=It produces HOW much power?
gtnh.quest2679.desc=Still not enough power? Try making turbines out of Awakened Draconium, Infinity Catalyst, or Infinity.%n%n§3Don't blame me if it explodes, try it out in creative first.

# Quest.2680 - Mutating Things is Cool
gtnh.quest2680.name=Mutating Things is Cool
gtnh.quest2680.desc=When making Raw Crystal Chips, you have two other options if using Europium constantly is too expensive for you: Bacterial Sludge, and Mutagen.%n%nMutagen is obviously better than the sludge, but how do you get it? I'll teach you how.%n%nFirst, get the Bacterial Sludge you got from Mars, and run it through a Brewery along with some U-238 to get EnrichedBacterialSludge. Then Ferment it to get FermentedBacterialSludge. And finally you Distill it to get Mutagen.%n%nBut is a single bucket enough for you? Hardly! But now that we have some, we can make more with the vat. Use the Mutagen you got along with some of that Mysterious Crystal Dust to make a culture. Unfortunately the chances are pretty low, so you'll almost certainly have to do it several times.%n%nOnce you have your culture you can use it in the vat along with some of the dust again to make more. You'll need LuV-tier glass, and Plutonium rods.%n%nIf you want to get more Bacterial Sudge more easily, you can use the vat to make that too! The culture is much easier to make.%n%n§3Mutagen is also used for Gendustry, so if you want to do that, make a bunch.

# Quest.2681 - Industrial Scale Seaweed Production
gtnh.quest2681.name=Industrial Scale Seaweed Production
gtnh.quest2681.desc=So you probably noticed that the amount of seaweed you'll need to make Bio circuits is kind of...intense. Collecting them yourself is a huge pain, and who wants to program robots? Plus servers. Fortunately, there's now a way to make seaweed.%n%nThe first thing you need is...Seaweed! Use that with Unknown Water you pumped from the same planet to make the culture. Expect this to take a while, as the chances are super low. You'll also need the max tier Bio Lab.%n%nOnce you have the culture you can make SeaweedBroth, by combining it with UnknownNutrientAgar and some other stuff. This can then be made into seaweed.

# Quest.2682 - TecTech Multiblocks
gtnh.quest2682.name=TecTech Multiblocks
gtnh.quest2682.desc=TecTech Multiblock Common Functionality%n%nMultiple Ampere and Laser Hatches Compatibility - to ease power distribution.%n%nPower Pass - Allows connected dynamo hatches to take power from the controller and output it, just like the active transformer does (and that is why the controller always need it in it's recipe if that function is enabled...).%n%nSave Void - Enabling this moves all EM (Elemental Matter, not all machines use this) from input and output hatches to overflow hatches. Which allows the machine to be disassembled more easily.%n%nConstructable Interface - Allows visualizing the structure with blueprints (there is an API to implement that for any block, but almost nothing does).%n%nFront Rotation - Allows rotating the front face of the machine for more structure orientation freedom (also available in API). This doesn't allow you to change the facing of the controller, but the orientation. So if you look at it from the front, it can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise. You also need to use the Front Rotation Scrench to do so. §3If you don't get it, try placing a controller, screnching it, and using the Blueprint on it.§r%n%n%nFrom left to right is 1, then clockwise for the rest in TT multi interfaces.%n%n1) Parameters - They are the way of the controller to communicate with player and parameter hatches. Lights indicate status but more detailed information can be seen when moused over. The tooltip contains ID in form of HatchID:ParameterNumber:Direction, Current Status, Current Value, and Short Description.%n%n2) Uncertainty status - These 9 blocks indicate uncertainty status of the machine. If the lights are on, this machine requires an uncertainty resolver. Red = Bad, Green = Good. You need to do the absurd puzzle before using the machine.%n%nControl buttons - Buttons might change their behavior and appearance depending on machine but usually they work like this, starting from top:%n%n3) Power Pass - Toggles Power Pass.%n%n4) Save Void - Toggles Safe Void.%n%n5) Power Switch - Soft Mallet with your finger...%n%n6) Input slot - Standard functionality.%n

# Quest.2683 - Configuring TecTech Multiblocks
gtnh.quest2683.name=Configuring TecTech Multiblocks
gtnh.quest2683.desc=The Parametrizer allows you to configure TecTech multis by adjusting the numbers. There are 3 different versions. Don't ask me how the latter two work, I have no idea.%n%nIf there are lit up sections in the Parameters part of the multi interface (see the TecTech Multiblocks quest), you can configure the multi, otherwise the block does nothing.%n%nIf you want to understand how using the Parametrizer works, you'll need to understand how binary works a little, so go do that. We'll also be using the Quantum Computer for the example, since that's what you probably want it for.%n%nID:0:0:I  ID:0:1:I     ID:1:0:I  ID:1:1:I%nID:0:0:O  ID:0:1:O    ID:1:0:O  ID:1:1:O%n%nOn the example above, the 'block' is represented by the first number of each group. In the first, it is 0, in the second, unused one, it is 1.%n%nThe letter I in the top groupings indicates Input, something that is either set by the Parametrizer, or is the default.%n%nThe letter O (right below the I) in the bottom number groupings indicates Output, this is information that the machine sends to you, that indicates things. (like heat or computation power)%n%nThe middle number indicates if it's the first or second parameter.%n%n%nIn the Parametrizer's interface, you have 16 buttons. Ignore the bottom row, it's not useful here. The left and right sided ones are for +/- to a greater degree, but that's not really useful to us, so ignore them too.%n%nIt defaults to Parameters: -1, use the +/- with ID on them to change which 'block' of parameters you're adjusting. For the QC, there's only the 0 'block', so set it to that.%n%nThe Down Arrow indicates the current value of O numbers, and the Up Arrow indicates the current value of I numbers. Remember that you can change I numbers? Use the +/- buttons to change them. They will change either the 0 or 1 number, depending on the icon on the button.%n%nIf you change the 0 value, this will change the Overclock Ratio, and if you change the 1 value, this will change the Overvoltage Ratio. For the QC at least.

# Quest.2684 - RP-1 Rocket Fuel
gtnh.quest2684.name=RP-1 Rocket Fuel
gtnh.quest2684.desc=In order to fuel the T2 rocket, you'll need some RP-1 Rocket Fuel. First, you'll need either Diesel (which you probably used to make the Cetane-Boosted Diesel for the T1), or Coal Tar. Coal Tar is the better option on the long run, since you'll need the other products of distilling it to make other rocket fuels, but for now you can use Diesel.§3%n%nIf you're using Diesel, you need 20 cells, if using Coal Tar, you need 30. Unless you use a DT, in which case it doesn't divide evenly anymore :(§r%n%nDistill it in the Distillery to get Kerosene, then distill it again to get RP-1. You'll need a Chemical Plant for the last step.%n%nRP-1 Rocket Fuel is a T3 240 EU/t recipe, so you'll need to make the CP out of Stainless Steel and HV Machine Casings.%n%nCombine Liquid Oxygen and RP-1 to make RP-1 Rocket Fuel. And no, I have no idea what the difference is.%n%n§3If you're confused about how to use/make the Chemical Plant, refer to the manual with the same name.%n%n§2PS: You can also use Rocket Fuels for power in Rocket Engines, or the Rocketdyne F-1A Engine multi.

# Quest.2685 - Coal Tar Distilling
gtnh.quest2685.name=Coal Tar Distilling
gtnh.quest2685.desc=In order to distill Coal Tar, you need to get some first. To do so, run Charcoal, Lignite, Coal, or Coal Coke though either the Industrial Coke Oven or the Pyrolyse Oven.%n%nSince you need multiple products, use a Distillery Tower to get them all. Everything other than Naphtha is used to make Rocket Fuels.

# Quest.2686 - Dense Hydrazine
gtnh.quest2686.name=Dense Hydrazine
gtnh.quest2686.desc=Dense Hydrazine is needed starting from rocket tier 3, so you should make some if you want to keep exploring space.%n%nIt's a T4 240 EU/t recipe, so you'll need to make the CP out of Titanium and HV Machine Casings.

# Quest.2687 - Monomethylhydrazine
gtnh.quest2687.name=Monomethylhydrazine
gtnh.quest2687.desc=You'll need this if you want to make CN3H7O3 (Purple) Rocket Fuel. It's also made in the Chemical Plant.

# Quest.2688 - CN3H7O3 (Purple) Rocket Fuel
gtnh.quest2688.name=CN3H7O3 (Purple) Rocket Fuel
gtnh.quest2688.desc=To make CN3H7O3 for your T5 rocket, you'll need to combine Monomethylhydrazine and Nitric Acid in a Chemical Plant. Make sure to upgrade your casings to Tungstensteel.

# Quest.2689 - Phtalic Acid Conversion
gtnh.quest2689.name=Phtalic Acid Conversion
gtnh.quest2689.desc=If you have a bunch of this lying around already (or you think it's easier), you can convert GT Phtalic acid into the GT++ version by running it through a Distillery.

# Quest.2690 - 2-Ethylanthrahydroquinone
gtnh.quest2690.name=2-Ethylanthrahydroquinone
gtnh.quest2690.desc=To make this complicated sounding chemical, combine the similarly named 2-Ethylanthraquinone and Hydrogen along with an Orange Catalyst in the Chemical Plant.%n%n§3You need Palladium to make the Catalyst, so keep that in mind.

# Quest.2691 - 2-Ethylanthraquinone
gtnh.quest2691.name=2-Ethylanthraquinone
gtnh.quest2691.desc=Does anyone else wonder why these chemicals have numbers in the name? No? Just me? Moving on, to make it, combine Phthalic Anhydride and Ethylbenzene in the Chemical Plant to make 2-Ethylanthraquinone.%n%nBTW the other recipe that makes this is used later in the processing chain. You can loop the 2-Ethylanthraquinone so you don't have to make more if you don't want to scale up.

# Quest.2692 - How Do You Even Pronounce This?
gtnh.quest2692.name=How Do You Even Pronounce This?
gtnh.quest2692.desc=To make Phthalic Anhydride, use a dehydrator. You need to use GT++ Phthalic Acid.

# Quest.2693 - Phthalic Acid, The Cool Kids' Way
gtnh.quest2693.name=Phthalic Acid, The Cool Kids' Way
gtnh.quest2693.desc=Make Phthalic Acid out of Naphthalene and Lithium in a Chemical Reactor.%n%nIronically, you can't make this out of Naphtha.

# Quest.2694 - Naphthalene
gtnh.quest2694.name=Naphthalene
gtnh.quest2694.desc=To make Naphthalene, combine your Coal Oil Tar with Sulfuric Acid to get Sulfuric Coal Tar Oil.%n%nThen distill it to get Naphthalene. Seem easy? It gets harder.

# Quest.2695 - Serious Upgrades
gtnh.quest2695.name=Serious Upgrades
gtnh.quest2695.desc=So if you thought 'hey, the purple stuff wasn't that bad, why not make the green?', well, first of all, you may need professional help. Second, you're going to need to be in ZPM to make the casings you need, full stop. You need a ZPM ABS for the components, so come back once you've made a ZPM Energy Hatch.%n%nYou can probably figure most of it out on your own, but keep in mind that some of the materials need to be created in the ABS, solidified, macerated, and then used in another ABS recipe. Examples are: Hastelloy-N and Inconel-792.%n%nLaurenium is also like this, and also inclues Rhenium and Dysprosium. Rhenium uses a nonstandard ABS recipe to make, and Dysprosium requires either making Rare Earth (III) or going to the Toxic Everglades. You'll also need to make Rare Earth (I) for Ytterbium or, again, visit the Everglades for it.%n%nHave fun with that!%n%n§3You'll almost certainly need more than this, but the exact amount, as always, depends on your hatches and busses.

# Quest.2696 - Beyond the Limit
gtnh.quest2696.name=Beyond the Limit
gtnh.quest2696.desc=Rugged Botmium Casings are currently completely optional, as well as being hard to make. They also don't do anything, other than return the CP back to a reasonable color, since there's no T7 recipes.%n%nYou can certainly figure out the rest by now, but the Advanced Nitinol may confuse you. You make it out of blocks of Nitinol 60 with a Quantum Anomaly in a Laser Engraver. This means you need to make the Cyclotron, and hit 2 1% chances in a row, so good luck with that!

# Quest.2697 - Chlorine, Your New Best Friend
gtnh.quest2697.name=Chlorine, Your New Best Friend
gtnh.quest2697.desc=Chlorine is a fluid that is used in significant quantities throughout the game, so you might as well get used to collecting it now.%n%nYou can electrolyse Salt, Rock Salt, Sodalite (finally a use!), or Salt Water for it. Since you'll need so much, you may wish to consider using your first Super Tank to hold it all.

# Quest.2698 - Niobium Needs
gtnh.quest2698.name=Niobium Needs
gtnh.quest2698.desc=While you're on Io, you should pick up some ore for Niobium. It'll be worth it later.

# Quest.2699 - Play it Again, Sam
gtnh.quest2699.name=Play it Again, Sam
gtnh.quest2699.desc=So if you thought one Quantum Computer was cool, what about two? You can chain them to get more computing power for your research by connecting them with Optical Connectors the same way you connect to the Research Station. The original QC should have the slave to receive the data from the second one.%n%nOf course, this is kinda expensive, so there's actually another option, and that's to simply extend the first one. You can tear down the last two columns of blocks and then use an itemstack of two blueprints to see how a 4 computer rack one would be built. However, you'll need another UV or higher hatch to power it if you use 4 racks, since that will use 5A. You can do the same for up to a 12 stack for 24 computer racks if you want.%n%nIf you use 3 racks with 3 Crystalprocessor Mainframes and 1 Advanced Heat Vent each, you'll have enough for the UEV circuit, and it won't overheat either. If you use 7 racks and 14 UHV circuits (2 vents each), you'll be able to research anything less than the Piko and Quantum circuits without overheating.

# Quest.2700 - LSC = MC^2
gtnh.quest2700.name=LSC = MC^2
gtnh.quest2700.desc=This is the final upgrade to the LSC. You can use either the Ultimate or Really Ultimate batteries to craft it, it costs about the same either way.

gtnh.quest2701.name=Chaotic Energy
gtnh.quest2701.desc=Finally, Infinite RF! ...But what can I even use that for?

# Quest.2702 - Tier 7 Schematic
gtnh.quest2702.name=Tier 7 Schematic
gtnh.quest2702.desc=Each rocket needs a construction plan. Scan it in a hv scanner and put the construction data on a data stick. The fourth tier schematic circuit uses an elite circuit and a heavy duty plate tier 6 and the data stick in a ZPM circuit assembler.

# Quest.2703 - Extra Large Fuel Canisters
gtnh.quest2703.name=Extra Large Fuel Canisters
gtnh.quest2703.desc=Every rocket needs fuel storage canisters. For the tier 7 rocket you need to craft two large and two extra large canisters.

# Quest.2704 - Booster Tier 3
gtnh.quest2704.name=Booster Tier 3
gtnh.quest2704.desc=The distance between Planets and Moons is much larger now, so the rocket needs bigger boosters to reach it.

# Quest.2705 - Heavy Duty Rocket Engine Tier 4
gtnh.quest2705.name=Heavy Duty Rocket Engine Tier 4
gtnh.quest2705.desc=Every rocket needs a rocket engine. A heavy one tier 3 is needed in the tier 5 rocket.

# Quest.2708 - Pluto Dungeon
gtnh.quest2708.name=Pluto Dungeon
gtnh.quest2708.desc=After hours and hours you will find a Pluto dungeon. A big hole will show you the way to the dungeon. Go and fight some mobs before you have to kill the Boss Monster. It will drop the key for the chest with the schematic for tier 8 rockets.%n%nThis will open a lot of planets outside of our solar system such as Barnarda.

# Quest.2709 - Booster Tier 4
gtnh.quest2709.name=Booster Tier 4
gtnh.quest2709.desc=The distance to other solar sytems is quite literally Astronomical, so you'll need even bigger boosters to reach them.

# Quest.2710 - Tier 8 Schematic
gtnh.quest2710.name=Tier 8 Schematic
gtnh.quest2710.desc=Each rocket needs a construction plan. Scan it in a hv scanner and put the construction data on a data stick. The fourth tier schematic circuit uses an elite circuit and a heavy duty plate tier 8 and the data stick in a UV circuit assembler.

# Quest.2711 - Fluids for Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2711.name=Fluids for Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2711.desc=Ok, so let's say you've made some kind of culture, but you want more of it? You only need one per Vat, but they're consumed when making DNA Samples, so you should probably learn how.%n%nTo start off, you'll need to get an eColi Culture.%n%nUse that to make the eColi Bacteria Fluid.§3 (I know the name is completely different, deal with it)§r%n%nCentrifuge that to make Liquid DNA.%n%nAnd combine it with Radon in the Mixer to make FluorecentdDNA.%n%neColi Bacteria Fluid can also be Centrifuged for Plasma Membranes (10% chance) and EnzymesSollution, so do that as well.%n%nAnd then Centrifuge the EnzymesSollution again for Polymerase.%n%nYou should expect to need a significant amount of eColi Bacteria Fluid if you plan on copying a lot of cultures, or making the hard to make ones.%n%n§3To search for items related to copying cultures, search for 'culture', 'dna sample', or 'plasmid'. You can't do this for the Data Orbs, you have to check the uses of DNA Samples.%n%n§5A bunch of the fluids have incorrect spelling, don't blame me for it.

# Quest.2712 - DNA Samples for Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2712.name=DNA Samples for Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2712.desc=To copy cultures, you'll need to make a DNA sample first. Many of these have low chances, but this one's 100%. I'm sure you can figure it out yourself, but keep in mind that the Modules are not consumed, and that you may wish to use one of the IC2 Crops for the Detergent materials.

# Quest.2713 - Data Orbs for Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2713.name=Data Orbs for Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2713.desc=After getting your sample you need to encode the information to a Data Orb. Again, many times you'll have to do it repeatedly (the Data Orb is given back if it fails), but in this case it's 100%.%n%n§3Look at the uses of the eColi DNA Sample to see the recipe.

# Quest.2714 - Actually Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2714.name=Actually Copying Cultures
gtnh.quest2714.desc=To copy a culture, you'll need%n1) A Sterilized Petri Dish%n2) A Plasma Membrane (made from Stemcells, or gotten while making EnzymesSollution)%n3) Stemcells%n4) A Data Orb with the appropriate data on it%n5) Liquid DNA%n6) A LuV Bio Lab%n7) A Clonal Cellular Synthesis Module%n%nYou can change out the Data Orb for one with whatever culture you wish to copy. Keep in mind that it might be easier to make a second culture the normal way, and that there's generally an alternative recipe that uses the fluid it produces to make it with a higher chance.%n%nPS: This recipe is the only one in NEI that uses this module, so you can find it if you look, but the number will change, so I can't specify which page.

# Quest.2715 - General Purpose Fermenting Bacteria
gtnh.quest2715.name=General Purpose Fermenting Bacteria
gtnh.quest2715.desc=So if you looked in NEI and tried to figure out how to make this, you were probably confused by the fact that you use the fluid it produces to make it. This is where NEI is lying to you. Like the previous recipe, NEI doesn't show it correctly (they should be around the same page in NEI, they both also appear to produce Sterilized Petri Dishes, (even if that's not true) and both use unique Modules).%n%nIn order to make this, you'll need to make the Rotten Flesh Bacteria culture, get the DNA Sample, and then get the Data Orb. It changes it's name to beta-Lactamase, that's normal.%n%nThen, do the same thing for Common Yeast (get the right Yeast!).%n%nThen you need to use the recipe to combine the information from the Data Orbs and get the Common Yeast Plasmid from that.%n%nLastly, use the Rotten Flesh Bacteria culture, the Common Yeast Plasmid, Penicillin (make it by centrifuging Common Yeast Fluid), and Distilled Water. You want the Transformation Module for this. It's a 100% chance.%n%nYou'll want to use the normal recipe to make more cultures, since it also becomes beta-Lactamase once you turn it into a DNA Sample.

# Quest.2716 - Longbow of the Heavens
gtnh.quest2716.name=Longbow of the Heavens
gtnh.quest2716.desc=Weak compared to both weapons of it's tier, and the weapons it's made of, this bow doesn't use arrows, never breaks, does 10 damage, and has an AoE of 10 more arrows that do 10 damage each fly down each time it strikes.

# Quest.2717 - The Ultimate Plastic
gtnh.quest2717.name=The Ultimate Plastic
gtnh.quest2717.desc=So, Radox Polymer. A highly complex plastic used for...absolutely nothing. But, you CAN make it. *Theoretically*.%n %nIf you dare take up this monumental challenge, you need to get the Xenoxene Xenoxis culture first. The recipe is similar to the General Purpose one, so you can't figure it out from NEI. Remember that all recipes in this chain are low probablility recipes.%n%nYour first step is to make the Barnardafis culture, then the DNA Sample, and then the Data Orb. If you didn't grab the saplings and dirt previously (to grow more trees for logs), head back to Barnarda C.%n%nUse the same recipe as for the General Purpose one, but use the Data Orb for Barnardafis instead of Common Yeast. You should get the Barnardafis Plasmid.%n%nAgain, it's the same recipe for the next step, but with the TCetiEis Fucus Serratus culture and the Barnardafis Plasmid, this should produce the Xenoxene Xenoxis culture. It's about a 4% chance.%n%nYou should probably use the normal alternative recipe to make more cultures, since it's easy to fail copying it too.%n%nFrom this point, it's pretty easy to figure it out, but basically, only Super Light Radox and Diluted Xenoxene (so you can run it again) are useful from Distilling. All the other products are kinda useless.%n%nHave fun with your useless ingot!

gtnh.quest2720.desc=Want to clear out shrubbery but don't want to pull out leaves by hand? Need to find that last log hidden in the middle of a bunch of leaves?%n%nTry an Iron Scythe! When used, it clears out a 5x5x5 area of leaves, crops, flowers, or grass. Excellent for tearing through Sacred Oak leaves or dense shrubbery in certain biomes. Later when you have a Cutting Machine you can upgrade to a Diamond Scythe with a 7x7x7 area of effect, or use Amethyst for 9x9x9 to FLEX.%n%n§3The lower tiers break leaves instantly, but don't seem to have the 3x3x3 range for some reason.

gtnh.quest2721.name=Personally, I prefer Pepsi™

# Quest.2729 - Genetically Modifying Your Plants
gtnh.quest2729.name=Genetically Modifying Your Plants
gtnh.quest2729.desc=There are 3 machines crucial to doing this. You'll also need bucketloads of power, and the same (literally) of UUM.%n%nAll 3 can only work on crops up to a certain tier, determined by the tier of the machine you made and the crop you're working with. Basically, it's (crop tier+2)/2, rounded up. So an LV machine can work on T1 crops, but an MV one can work on T3. You can't modify Primoridal Berries though, as they would be UHV.%n%n§3LV=T1, MV=T3, HV=T5, EV=T7, IV=T9, LuV=T11, ZPM=T13, UV=15, UHV is uncraftable.§r%n%nFirst is the Crop Gene Extractor:%nIt takes an existing crop seedbag, an empty §2Data Orb§r (See EV quests), and §61A§r while running. Use a circuit to determine what stat to copy to the Data Orb. You'll probably want either 23-31-0, or 31-31-0 for max speed and output, since you won't be breeding from these. Remember to take proper precautions if going over 23, as they will attempt to weed everything around them. There's a significant number of crops, so you'll probably need a ton of Orbs too, unless you want to reuse them. §4Remember to keep a Data Orb or seedbag backup!§r%n%nSecond is the Crop Synthesizer:%nIt takes §24 Data Orbs§r, one for each of the types from the CGE, §51000L of UUM per crop tier/2§r (this is not rounded), and §616A§r while running. It will create a new crop seedbag with the desired stats.%n%nLastly is the Crop Replicator:%nIt takes an existing crop seedbag, §51000L per crop tier of UUM§r, and §66A§r while running. After finishing, it gives you back two of the same seedbag, duplicating it. This takes twice as much UUM, but less power, it's up to you whether that's worth it.
