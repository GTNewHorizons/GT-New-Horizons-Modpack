## Quest Line: And So, It Begins
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.name=And So, It Begins
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.desc=The very first tier, tier zero. This chapter will introduce you to the basic mechanics of this modpack. Mods covered: Vanilla, Pam's Harvestcraft.

# Quest: Your First Night
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.name=§d§3§2§1§lYour First Night
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.desc=Hello, friend, and welcome to GTNH!%n%nDon't get used to things being nice and comfy, because in about ten minutes the sun will set, and unlike Vanilla Minecraft, there's no light whatsoever at night but plenty of Infernal mobs coming to get you. So your first task is to find food and shelter for the night.%n%nBut by the end of this questtab you will have a bed to make things easier.%n%nYou don't need to keep this book. Even if you don't have the item, you can press Tilde (~) to view it at any time...unless you decided to change the keybind.%n%nIf you need any extra help or just want to hang out, feel free to visit our Discord server at [url]https://discord.gg/gtnh[/url]. And yes, the links are clickable! On the Discord, select your tech tier in #role-select - it will help people to tailor their advice to your situation.%n%nMany GTNH topics are explained in our Wiki at [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Main_Page[/url]. It does not have the same extent and structure as the Questbook, but some things are much better with pictures and tables! The wiki also has tips on extra topics like what additional mods might work with the pack, how GTNH can be installed for modern Java versions or how to set up a server.%n%nAdditionally, there is a spreadsheet at [url]https://www.gtnewhorizons.com/spreadsheet[/url] for the info you would want a spreadsheet for.%n%nIf you play through a launcher that relies on [warn]CurseForge[/warn], be aware that it doesn't always work properly. It doesn't play well with all the custom versions of mods that this pack has. So if you have any problems, first switch to another launcher like MultiMC, Prism, or Technic. The wiki has instructions there as well. The latest version of the pack is available on the Discord channel from #announcements or with the !download command.%n%nHopefully you didn't get munched by a monster while reading this, good luck!

# Quest: Where's the Flint?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ.name=§1§lWhere's the Flint?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ.desc=As you might have noticed when collecting gravel, no Flint dropped for you.%n%nWell, there is a... recipe for that. Look up Flint in Not Enough Items (NEI) and craft some!%n%nThe search field of NEI is at the bottom of the screen when you open your inventory. The results are on the right side.

# Quest: Sticks 'n Stones
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg.name=§1§lSticks 'n Stones
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg.desc=This book has a built-in reading light, lucky you! You can read about quests while you're waiting for the night to be over, but for now, you may want to get the basics done. If it isn't dark already, go out and collect some gravel and wood.%n%nKeep in mind that you need food, so look for Pam's Harvestcraft gardens. Save some of the drops from them for seeds. Alternatively, right-click the gardens with an empty hand to get the garden item itself. If you place it somewhere else, it will spread into more of the same garden up to a limit within that area.%n%nMake sure to read the info-quests linked to the first quest, they have important info!

# Quest: Storage For Days
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAw.name=§1§lStorage For Days
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAw.desc=Now that you've gotten your tools and are about to go collect a bunch of stuff, it's time to make some storage for it.%nTake some of your wood, and craft a chest. You will need 4 wood, 4 planks, and 1 flint.

# Quest: Tools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQ.name=§1§lTools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQ.desc=Now that you've got a shelter and a crafting table, you should make some tools, unless you'd like to continue punching trees with your bare hands.%n%nYou should probably make the axe first so you can get wood for the rest more easily.

# Quest: You Reap...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABg.name=§1§lYou Reap...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABg.desc=You won't always get food rewards from the quests, so it might be a good idea to take care of that problem.%n%nAs you've crafted a hoe already, go and find some water nearby to make a field. With this modpack you can only make farmland within range of water. Let's trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your own farm.%n%nTo get other wheat, use a hoe on grass away from water. You'll get Witchery seeds too - save those for later.%n%nStart planting a Cotton field because it's a key early-game resource.%n%nYou can also get seeds from villages, and grow the seeds from the Pam's garden food.

# Quest: ...What You Sow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABw.name=§1§l...What You Sow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABw.desc=If you, by chance, did read the previous quest and planted the carrots, then you're fine.%n%nMeanwhile, you should turn some more fruits and vegetables into seeds, and increase the size of your farm to get a steady supply of food.

# Quest: Get That Stone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA.name=§1§lGet That Stone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA.desc=Look at you, with your shiny wooden pickaxe!%n%nTime to mine some cobblestone. Yay! You can even improve your dirt hut!

# Quest: Fire, Fire, Grandpa!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQ.name=§1§lFire, Fire, Grandpa!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQ.desc=Time to burn some stuff, isn't it? You can't make charcoal in it, but you sure will find some usage for it soon™.

# Quest: Rest in Pieces
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACg.name=§1§lRest in Pieces
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACg.desc=It's GLOPPing time! Go kill some pigs to gather meat.

# Quest: Fluffy and Red
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADA.name=§1§lFluffy and Red
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADA.desc=Epic quest: Kill some sheep! (And try to get some wool, for a bed, obviously...)

# Quest: SO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADQ.name=§1§lSO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADQ.desc=Sleepy time, and the end of the tutorial.%n%nCongratulations! You've built your first hideout, and you should have a steady supply of food by now.%n%nSee you again in Tier 0!

# Quest: Collecting Some Berries
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1Q.name=§1§lCollecting Some Berries
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1Q.desc=Are you waiting for the carrots to grow? Go and find some berry bushes and berries.%n%nThe berries are a good source of food, and you can put these bushes around your house to make a wall. It should provide a good protection against all those monsters that want to come into your house and kill you.

# Quest: Berry Medley
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1g.name=§1§lBerry Medley
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1g.desc=Hmmm... what can you do with all those berries? Just eating? You will see that they have a very low saturation level. Let's plant the new berry bushes and mix the berries to make some better food.

# Quest: Food Variants
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1w.name=§2§1§lFood Variants
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1w.desc=Maybe you noticed already that eating the same food too often is very boring and not healthy anymore. Some food like tea leaf can be taken to the furnace and processed further. So take a break and drink a cup of tea. Maybe munch some tasty raisins as they are very nice.

# Quest: Can You Hear the Carrots Grow?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB5A.name=§1§lCan You Hear the Carrots Grow?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB5A.desc=Tired of waiting since your carrots grow sooooo slowly?%n%nBone meal will help you to grow food in seconds.%n%nChop down some trees to get a bit of bone meal as a reward.

# Quest: Goals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABjA.name=§1§lGoals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABjA.desc=GregTech New Horizons is a long and intricate mod pack with massive amounts of custom content and over three thousand quests to guide you through it.%n%nWe recommend you set yourself small goals from tier to tier and see how far your journey takes you.%n%nThe ultimate late game goal is to craft a Stargate or two, but the recipe is outrageous, and very few players have ever done so.%n%nIf you need a big goal for your run, we suggest to aim for something less crazy.%nLike going to the moon if it's your first time playing.%nOr making and automating an Assembly Line if you have never done so.%nOr crafting the Tier 8 Rocket which is the last regular rocket and is reached in UHV.

# Quest: Even more challenges needed?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABjQ.name=§1§lEven more challenges needed?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABjQ.desc=You have played through most of the pack a few times already? Maybe you even made a Stargate? Or are you just looking for something a bit different? Don't worry, we have a few options for you:%n%n- Play in Hardcore. Either Minecraft Hardcore, or BetterQuesting Hardcore. The latter is a bit more forgiving. Maybe this seems impossible, but people have indeed reached UEV+ in Minecraft Hardcore. Better be prepared to restart a few times. This is obviously not for everybody.%n%n- Never make a rocket. The so called §ono-rocket run§r is somewhat supported by now, you will be able to do almost everything in the pack. Use bees, crops, and blood magic meteors as your main resource production. Be warned though that such a challenge is grindy and slow. For instance, you might need to collect large amounts of andratite ore or via the aluminium bauxite slag route to get your first titanium. Or have to start breeding bees early without much technology to help.%n%n- Skyblock. Yes, really. It is also known as Garden of Grind and it is absolutely brutal. There is no actually supported skyblock version of the pack but some players have figured out the minimal amount of changes needed to make it work. Ask around or search on the official discord channel for all the details. But don't expect any fun down this road.%n%n- Speedrunning. A few players have designed some basic rules and have started to record speedruns to early game goals like the Coke Oven. Ask around or search on the official discord channel for all the details. Maybe you just want to watch how they do it.

# Quest: Oak Trees Are Not Apple Trees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABuA.name=§1§lOak Trees Are Not Apple Trees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABuA.desc=Oak trees that give apples? Who the hell added this to minecraft?%nYou found a way of combining an oak sapling and an apple to get an apple tree sapling. Try to plant one to get a permanent source of food.%n%nOnce you complete this quest, check out the rest of the Quest Tabs. A new one, "Coins, Coins, Coins", has unlocked. You'll want to look through all the quest tabs to make sure something new hasn't unlocked somewhere else occasionally. There are lots of tabs, so be sure to scroll down!

# Quest: "Baked" Potatoes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABug.name=§1§l"Baked" Potatoes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABug.desc=Eating raw potatoes isn't that healthy, as you might have noticed. Some potatoes are green and poisonous already. After you get a furnace you can make delicious baked potatoes as another food alternative. Put a baked potato on a stick to make it even more delicious.

# Quest: Soft Mallet Adventure
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABvA.name=§1§lSoft Mallet Adventure
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABvA.desc=You now have some melon slices or pumpkins but what can you do with them?%n%nYou can just eat them or... use a mallet to get some seeds. OK, let's craft one. Perhaps you can use this mallet for some other things too.

# Quest: Monster Trap
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADYQ.name=§1§lMonster Trap
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADYQ.desc=If you're lucky enough to spawn near a sand- or rainforest biome, you can find some quicksand.%n%nCollect a stack of it, dig a small ditch, and fill it with the quicksand to protect your "dirt base" home. Just don't fall in!

# Quest: Bamboo Fence
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADsg.name=§1§lBamboo Fence
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADsg.desc=Maybe you're lucky and started in a bamboo forest. Bamboo is a very useful tree since it grows really fast and when you break the bottom-most block, the whole thing comes apart.%n%nYou can use them as sticks, or you can place the bamboo sticks to grow and make a three-block-tall wall to protect your base. You can also use Berry Bushes for that, assuming you don't want to spend materials on fences.

# Quest: Crafting Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEtA.name=§1§lCrafting Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEtA.desc=It's time to get yourself a 3x3 crafting area. Use your flint and some wood to build one!

# Quest: Cows Are Supposed to Moo!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFww.name=§1§lCows Are Supposed to Moo!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFww.desc=What the...? You noticed that sometimes when you kill something, even a cow or chicken, it explodes! What madness!%n%nTo stop it, use a proper GregTech Knife or Butchery Knife to kill them. Craft a flint GregTech knife with a stick and a piece of flint.%n%nTo see its recipe, see how a generic knife is made - NEI should show you many pages. The recipe you need should be on the last page. You can scroll pages with your mouse wheel.%n%n[note]Alternatively you can use the search bar to search for a specific tool material, in this case flint![/note]%n%nAs a reward, here's an iron knife to use once the flint one wears out.

# Quest: Creeping Dread
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMg.name=§1§lCreeping Dread
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMg.desc=Creepers can make you have a baaaad time.%n%nDrowning Creeper - when it explodes, it surrounds you in a ball of cobble filled with water. Not only do you have to escape, but the cobble is infested with silverfish! And those silverfish are all infernal! The best way to deal with it is to first escape up or down. If you have to clear the cobble ball, first clear the water. Surrounding the cobble with a dirt moat will keep the silverfish inside and unable to hide. Put down punjis, quicksand, or lava, and/or spectral glass. Make a wall with a 1x1 window and use that to break the cobbles - fishing silverfish is especially dangerous.%n%nEnder Creeper - Randomly teleports you a short distance - possibly deep underground.

# Quest: Caught in the Web
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMw.name=§1§lCaught in the Web
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMw.desc=Some spider have nasty modifiers:%n%nWitch spiders reflect missile damage back at you. If you see a red X on their back, draw your melee weapon and prepare for close combat...%n%nMother spiders will spawn a lot of baby spiders on death, some of which may be infernal.%n%nA flying spider can grab the oblivious flier.%n%nGhost spiders are partially invisible and can pass through thin walls.

# Quest: Porkchops With Attitude
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHNA.name=§1§lPorkchops With Attitude
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHNA.desc=The only zombie pigman to watch out for is the Vampire Pigman. He hardly takes any damage unless you use a wooden sword as a stake, or have a magical sword.

# Quest: Tell Me When We Reach 20
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHOQ.name=§1§lTell Me When We Reach 20
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHOQ.desc=Jumping all the time is exhausting and makes you really hungry.%nTo reduce your food depletion, you might want to use stairs instead.

# Quest: Staying Cool in the Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHQA.name=§1§lStaying Cool in the Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHQA.desc=If you happen to be near a snowy biome, you can harvest the snow to make delicious smoothies. They are more satiating than eating the berries by themselves.

# Quest: Loading the Chunks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALOg.name=§1§lLoading the Chunks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALOg.desc=Minecraft works in chunks - the 16x16 columns of blocks from bedrock to sky. The chunks in a radius around you are simulated or, in other words, chunkloaded. If a chunk is not loaded, nothing happens in it - crops don't grow, machines don't work. Thus, you want to have your base chunkloaded when you're off exploring. Later on, you want your base chunkloaded so things don't spontaneously blow up, especially multi-block machines.%n%nYou can chunkload in a few ways:%n%n1) The ServerUtilities mod. With default settings, you will not be able to chunkload. Feel free to change that in the config if you are in singleplayer (SP) or running your own server.%n%n2) Use four types of Anchors from Railcraft, although they are not craftable until the Low Voltage (LV) tier. In SP, or a server you run, cheat in Admin Anchors to chunkload forever, for free. They're limited on servers to prevent TPS dropping from people chunkloading a base forever when they aren't even there. On the officials, you need to use Ender Fragments, Ender Pearls, or Coins to fuel them. Look at the tooltip on each for how long it will work, and in what chunkloader.%n%n3) Use one of the blocks that chunkloads itself. If you do this on a server, expect the admins to possibly get very mad at you if it's not something you're allowed to do. Same for vanilla methods.%n%nDon't use chicken chunks to get anchor-like blocks. It's buggy.


## Quest Line: Tips and Tricks
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALA.name=Tips and Tricks
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALA.desc=All our collected wisdom, in one convenient place. Many Greggers died to bring you this knowledge.

# Quest: Automating Power On/Off
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGdg.name=§6§lAutomating Power On/Off
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGdg.desc=Once you have a GT boiler or Large Combustion Engine with a long startup time, you may wish to automate turning it on/off to save fuel, since extra power or Steam will just be voided. Additionally, the bigger your Steam/EU buffer is, the less time your generators will spend heating up, which makes them more efficient.%n%nUse a Machine Controller Cover on the controller for that. You can put it on top, bottom, or sides next to a casing - casings will transmit the redstone signal. You can use a Soldering Iron and Fine Soldering Alloy Wire to set the Redstone Output of a controller block to strong. When set to Strong it can go through a casing, but not hatches, buses, or other blocks. Use it with an activity detector if you want to receive a signal from the controller rather than turning it on/off with one.%n%nWith a Machine Controller Cover, you can use redstone to turn the machine on and off. This is handy if you don't want to use a Soft Hammer to disable a machine yourself constantly.%n%nThe best way to do that is with an RS latch. One input will turn the machine on, and one input will turn the machine off. Use a comparator attached to a valve to measure the steam level in your multiblock Iron or Steel Tank. Invert the signal to turn on your boiler when the steam level is low. When the steam level signal is high, turn your boiler off. Use a trail of redstone to lower the signal strength. Because of boiler/turbine warmup, try to set the ON strength to 30 percent of capacity and OFF strength to about 90 percent.%n%nRed alloy wire will hold a redstone signal for a longer distance than normal redstone, while redstone conduits will go indefinitely. You can also use amplified redcrystal to improve the strength of the signal for a long distance, repeating as necessary.%n%nYou can use an Energy Detector Cover in Normal Electrical Storage (including batteries) mode to monitor the power in a battery buffer and use it to enable/disable generators in a similar way. Change mode using a screwdriver. If you use a dense redcrystal, it will only allow signal through at a certain level, perfect for automating this kind of thing.%n%nFor a video version, check out this video: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPfnifJEO64[/url]

# Quest: Underground Fluids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ-w.name=Underground Fluids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ-w.desc=So you're probably wondering what all the underground fluids are. You can actually check so in NEI now!%n%nJust look for the tab called §oUnderground Fluid Stats§r. You can click §oSee All§r for a general overview, search by fluid, or search by planet.

# Quest: Covering Up
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDw.name=Covering Up
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDw.desc=This quest goes over all of the covers, just in case you forgot or they weren't mentioned. If they have their own quest, look at it for more info. You can put them on basically any GT block, pipe, machine, tank, etc. Though that doesn't consider whether it will work right or be useful. Shift-right-click will open a GUI for many of them. For covers that you can adjust the amount of, clicking the left side with a screwdriver goes down, and right goes up. All covers block rain on the side they're attached to. Generally you can adjust covers with a screwdriver, whether they have a GUI or not. You can remove them with a crowbar if you forgot.%n%n§lFluid-Related Covers:§r%nPump: Transfers fluids at the speed specified on the tooltip.%n%nFluid Regulator: Regulates the rate that fluid can go through it, as well as pumping it. Can work x/s or x/t.%n%nSteam Valve: Moves more, but is only for steam. Only goes to IV. Does not work on SH steam.%n%nOverflow: Voids anything over the specified amount in the tank.%n%nFluid Detector: Will emit a redstone signal (RS) based on fluid fill rate of the tank it's on. By default, empty=15, full=0. Use inverted mode to swap. Useful on tanks and hatches.%n%nEnder Fluid Link: Cover version of ender tanks to TP fluid around. Doesn't connect to ender tanks though.%n%nDrain Module: Protects from rain on that side, and will fill the tank with water from rain if it can. Useless.%n%nFluid Filter: Filters fluid going through it. Click with a cell to set it.%n%nShutter: Blocks items/fluids when active. Use it with a machine controller and RS. Does not visually disconnect/block. You place it between the pipes, and put the MC on the same pipe.%n%n§lItem-Related Covers:§r%nConveyor: Sends items. Use an item pipe in import mode or on a GT block/machine.%n%nRobot Arm: Sends from a specific slot in the machine it's on (internal) to another specific slot in a block next to it (adjacent). Keep going through numbers until you get it right, it seems to change per machine. If the output slot is full, it won't output. There need to be a valid block with slots to send to or the settings won't save.%n%nItem Detector: Will emit RS based on item fill rate of the block it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Detects by filled slots, so doesn't work right with the super/quantum chests. Probably better for buses.%n%nItem Filter: This one is work-in-progress that is not yet finished. Feel free to contribute.%n%n§lEU-Related Covers:§r%nEnergy Detector: Will emit RS based on EU fill rate of the batbuff/tank it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Make sure to set it to include batteries. Can also detect steam for some reason.%n%nPower Pass Upgrade: Read the tooltip, then ask Bart how it works, he didn't bother telling anyone. He'll probably just tell you the code is the best documentation, just like the Tectech guys. May not actually be finished/work, either.%n%nTesla Coil/Tesla Coil Rich Edition: Use with the Tesla Tower to send EU wirelessly or something.%n%n§lOther Covers:§r%nPlayer Detector: Detects players. About 10 block range. [warn]Currently owner/other is inverted on non-pipes due to some bug or another.[/warn]%n%nActivity Detector: Detects either recipe progress or idleness. 0%%=0 RS, ~95%%=14 by default. In idle mode, idleness is 15, and is 0 when running by default.%n%nMachine Controller: Turns machine on/off based on RS. Disable machine will keep it off regardless of RS state. Safe Mode only works on MBs. If a MB runs out of power, it will normally turn off, but a MC will turn it back on, continuing to void stuff. This will set it to the disable machine state instead. You will also get a notification. [warn]Safe mode is currently broken?[/warn]%n%nNeeds Maintenance: Emits RS if it meets the condition specified. Rotor=turbine?%n%nRedstone Transmitter/Receiver (In/Out): OK, these things are confusing, so listen closely. First, set a frequency, either by using the GUI, or using the original way: right-clicking it with an item. Empty hand = 0, other items = their item ID. Be careful not to reset it to 0 by accident. Honestly, just use the GUI. You can set it to private or not, it's the same kind of thing as EnderStorage, so you don't blare RS across the server. Channel state = RS level.%n%nRT(O) sets the channel state based on the redstone level sent from outside to the specific side. You can TP an RS from this to the RR(O).%nRT(I) sets the channel state based on redstone level that would be emitted from the machine itself. [warn]Always sends 15, so it's useless.[/warn]%nRR(O) outputs redstone level based on channel state. You can TP RS from the RT(O) to here.%nRR(I) controls whether a machine can work based on channel state, just like a machine controller cover does. If it has 0 RS, it stays off. At least 1, and it turns on. You send the signal from elsewhere with the RT(O).%nRR(I) can also be used in conjunction with other covers whose states talk about conditional.%n%nIC2 Heat vents: Speeds up machines a tiny amount? Also looks neat. TODO: someone please look at the code to see what it actually does.%n%nCrafting Table: Adds a crafting table to the block you can use. Mostly cosmetic.%n%nPlanks/Plates/Foils: Blocks I/O on that side. Use a screwdriver to set allowed types of stuff through. Blocks everything by default. Set the output to another side first to avoid changing its settings too. You'll probably 'use' this by accident at least once.%n%nComputer Monitor: Adds a visual look. Cosmetic-only cover.%n%nLens: Cosmetic-only cover.%n%nYou can also use AE2 facades as cosmetic covers.


## Quest Line: Tier 0 - Stone Age
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ.name=Tier 0 - Stone Age
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ.desc=This tab continues the basics until you make your first steam machine, and are ready for the real GT stuff

# Quest: You Need Them All part 2
betterquesting.quest.4g20EVdxSWyOUMhZXkcIWQ.name=§2§lYou Need Them All part 2
betterquesting.quest.4g20EVdxSWyOUMhZXkcIWQ.desc=There are many more backpacks: Coiners, thaumaturges, trackmanns...

# Quest: Ready, Set, Go!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADw.name=§2§lReady, Set, Go!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADw.desc=You probably should have a home by now. A steady supply of food is a fundamental requirement at all times. Take this journal to keep track of the things you've eaten. You will have to travel far in this tier, better be prepared!

# Quest: Sand: The Gathering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQ.name=§2§lSand: The Gathering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQ.desc=In a strange vision you saw a big structure which would allow you to make charcoal. Finally some torches! According to your calculations, you will need a lot of sand for that.

# Quest: Basic Processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEg.name=§2§lBasic Processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEg.desc=Most things are unavailable at the moment, so let's begin with something simple. Take some of your cobblestone and smelt it into regular stone. Since this modpack is evil, you'll need to use wood for that. How much fun is that?!

# Quest: Macerator v0.1 Alpha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEw.name=§1§2§lMacerator v0.1 Alpha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEw.desc=This fancy little device works (almost...) like a macerator. Some people say it's even better, since it does not require power, yay! You only need to craft one for this quest, but you probably should make some more if you can...%n%n[note]The mortar lets you make flint much, much more efficiently - you only need one gravel instead of three. Many tools and stations you'll make in the future will also open up better crafting recipes for things you can already make as well. If you need something but are hard up on resources, use NEI to check the recipes for that item - you may have options you didn't before.[/note]

# Quest: Gravel: The Gathering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFA.name=§2§lGravel: The Gathering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFA.desc=You think it would be a good idea to collect more gravel in order to provide yourself with flint for the journey ahead. Try searching near water.

# Quest: Clay: The Gathering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFQ.name=§2§lClay: The Gathering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFQ.desc=While bored, you thought that it might be a good idea to take up pottery. You should go and find some clay, the riverbanks should have some.

# Quest: Finite Water!?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFg.name=§2§lFinite Water!?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFg.desc=Finite water is a problem, that's for sure. Last night, you had an idea. If you can drink cacti, you should also be able to make water out of 8 cacti and use that for most recipes that require water. How cool is that? So what about another trade? 10 wood for... 3 cacti so you can set up a farm. Deal?%n%nTo automate the farm, place a string next to the cactus and a sand on top of the string. Now when the cactus grows, it will automatically break! You can stack this horizontally and vertically to make a very efficient cactus farm. Use water to redirect the cactus to a convenient pickup location or to above a hopper.%n%nFirst player to make a base running off of only cactus water gets a cape!

# Quest: Something to Carry Liquids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFw.name=§2§lSomething to Carry Liquids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFw.desc=You tried to move water with your bare hands, which didn't work at all. Luckily, you remember how to make a bucket out of clay dust.%n%nPut it in a mortar to get small clay dust which can be crafted to clay dust.

# Quest: Forming Press v0.1
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGg.name=§2§lForming Press v0.1
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGg.desc=As you may have noticed, you cannot turn clay into bricks directly. Well, to be fair, it wasn't a good recipe anyway. You'll probably end up with something bread-shaped.%n%nIn order to make bricks, you need a form. Get yourself a knife by putting flint above a stick on the crafting grid. With a knife, you can cut a brick sized piece out and craft a blank pattern. It's as easy as that.

# Quest: Finally, Some Powerful Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGw.name=§2§lFinally, Some Powerful Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGw.desc=Now that you have a coke oven, you can start producing charcoal. The more, the better. Creosote is produced at the same time, and the Coke Oven will stop when it's full of either one, which means you can't just leave the Creosote there.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIQ.name=§2§lTinker-Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIQ.desc=While using your flint tools is fun in terms of killing pigs and cows, they are not long-lasting and can't be repaired. Plus Infernals laugh at your attempts to kill them. You discovered how to craft tools that can be repaired and upgraded, but for that you definitely need a more advanced crafting technique.%n%nIf you have to use wood other than oak to make your tables, you can convert them to the default oak wood type to complete this quest.

# Quest: Zinc Gravel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIg.name=§2§lZinc Gravel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIg.desc=You can find it in chunks of gravel on the surface.%n%nUse as little as possible and save the rest for when you get a macerator in Steam age, you'll get twice as much.%n%nIf you can't find any, you can buy them in the Coins tab.%n%nIf you get enough and fully process it, you can also get gallium for gallium arsenide in LV age.

# Quest: Important Tools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJA.name=§2§lImportant Tools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJA.desc=In order to craft even basic machines, you'll need new tools. Most of them can be replaced by machines later. For now, you should become familiar with each of their recipes, as you will need a lot of these tools, starting today.%n%nYour new tools can also be used to make Railcraft water tanks, a very useful multiblock considering the finite water feature.%n%nThere are also electric versions of the tools, you can upgrade later if you want. Also, there are many versions of the tools, they generally follow the same rules as tinkers parts in terms of how good they are, similarly to turbines. You can look at the spreadsheet for more info on GT tool stats.%n%nFor this quest, you can use whatever materials you want. The gem version of the saw is crafted differently to metal versions. Higher tier tools need steel or tungstensteel rods instead of sticks.

# Quest: Getting Iron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJQ.name=§2§lGetting Iron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJQ.desc=Iron can be found in multiple veins.%nMagnetite veins (Y 30-180), Chalcopyrite veins (Y 5-60), and Limonite veins (Y 10-40) all contain iron ore.

# Quest: Making Better Tools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJg.name=§2§lMaking Better Tools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJg.desc=With zinc and copper, you can create a material with a higher melting temperature - Brass - which can be used to cast better tools.%n%nFor that, you need a smeltery. See the Multiblock Goals tab for details. You can also grab some extra blocks from some villages, but they don't count towards the quest.%n%nAlternatively, there are also one-time-use clay casts available.%n%nYou can then use your fancy bronze to make better tools with a higher mining level.%n%nRemember, you need to use the pickaxe a bit to gather mining XP if you want the full mining level on your bronze pickaxe. Certain tool upgrades can give that directly if you have an upgrade slot available.

# Quest: Better Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJw.name=§2§lBetter Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJw.desc=While standard chests are good for your basic items and goods, they are not ideal for storing a large amount of ore. You should build yourself some barrels in order to keep things organized.

# Quest: You Shall Proceed
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKA.name=§2§lYou Shall Proceed
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKA.desc=As you've gathered and crafted all materials and tools you need for your basic steam machinery, you may now proceed to the next tier. Keep in mind that you'll need mountains of resources in order to craft even the simplest things, so you probably should stock up on all ores in this tier. But that's up to you.%n%nAs a special reward, you get a pair of Holo Glasses to look inside your inventories. Place it into the mask slot, and use the keybind to turn it on.%n%n[note]Tip: If you double-click the NEI search field the resulting highlighted search also applies to what you can see with your Holo Glasses![/note]

# Quest: Don't Burn Your Fingers!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKQ.name=§2§lDon't Burn Your Fingers!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKQ.desc=You have decided it's time to make some tasty pizza, but your fingers got burned badly. Reading an ancient cookbook you discovered a pair of magical items that would allow you to carry anything hot, even lava in a bucket.%n%n§6§5The gloves have to be placed in the Baubles ring slots of Thaumcraft. You also have to place each in the correct slot, you'll get a notification if it's wrong.%n%n§rFor the protection effect, the hot item has to be in your active slot. I wonder if there is some way to carry more than a few buckets at a time?

# Quest: Cow Tipper
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKg.name=§2§r§2§lCow Tipper
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKg.desc=Before you had to kill some pigs and sheep to complete quests. Now it's time to kill some cows and hopefully get some leather. If you are lucky and get a cow trophy you may never need to kill another cow in the future.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB2A.name=§2§lYour First Tool
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB2A.desc=When your tinkers tables are ready, you can craft your first §oreal§r tool. If you didn't find a village yet to grab some parts from the chest, you can only craft flint tools.%n%nLet's start with a pickaxe, an axe, and a shovel.%n%nKeep in mind that most of the original tool parts from Tinker's Construct are not shown in NEI. That doesn't mean that you can't craft them - use the tooltips on patterns and molds as guidance.%n%nYour new tools are weak at first, but the more you use them the better they will get. You get a modifier slot after some levels, needing more as you level it up. They will level up to level 99 if you play long enough, with 20 modifier slots. Tool parts can be replaced for a bit of level XP, however the tool must be fully repaired first.%n%nYou need to level up the mining level each time you replace the parts to unleash the full power of the pickaxe. Stone->Copper for this pickaxe. If you manage to get a Zombie, Skeleton, or Creeper head, you can use it to skip the level-up process. This doesn't use up a modifier level, but does change the look until you change the pickaxe part out.%n%nItem=Usable when mining level is X or less%nZombie=1%nSkeleton=2%nCreeper=4%nWither Skeleton=7%nNether Star=8%n%nYou could use a paper binding to add an extra modifier, but you will also get modifiers with tool levels.

Works with small ores too.

# Quest: Creosote
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4Q.name=§l§2§lCreosote
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4Q.desc=I guess you already turned some wood into charcoal and wonder what to do with all this creosote? Well, you can burn it in a normal Furnace to cook your food or anything else, or you can make some torches with it. You can save up on the Coal variants, while at the same time keeping the Coke Oven running for the items you really need.%n%nYou can use a Bucket to pick up the Creosote, but not a Clay Bucket, either through the icon in the machine's interface, or by right-clicking the Coke Oven with an empty bucket in hand.%n%nYou will eventually want to automate Coke Ovens, and that's when you can use it to generate power. This is mostly LV content, but the singleblock option is the GT++ Semifluid Generator, whereas the multiblock option is the Railcraft Liquid Fueled Boiler. You'll unlock the quests for these when the time comes.

# Quest: Animal Farms
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4g.name=§2§lAnimal Farms
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4g.desc=Trying to get some leather or wool? You'd probably need to spend a lot of time hunting animals and traveling around, or you could simply make a farm to get a decent amount of leather, wool, and meat close to home. Make sure you don't put too many animals in the pen or they will overcrowd and kill each other. This happens to villagers as well.%n%nAnimals will prioritize moving towards grass blocks over any other blocks, and if there's no grass blocks around, they prefer lit blocks over dark blocks. You can encourage animals to stay in pens, or at least not crowd the edges, by removing grass from around both sides of the fence and under it, and by placing a torch in the center of the pen. For sheep that need the grass to eat, which reduces time to mature and replaces sheared wool instantly, place it in the center of a cleared out area with a border of non-grass.%n%nAlso, large quantities can cause server lag, especially if they are bumping into each other a lot. So if you are in multiplayer, make sure you limit animals to no more than roughly one per block for small entities like chickens and one per two blocks for large entities like cows.%n%nAs an alternative, most animal and mob drops can be obtained from less laggy IC2 crop farms.

# Quest: Gardener
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4w.name=§2§lGardener
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4w.desc=If you were wondering: Why do I never get seeds when destroying grass? Because.%n%nUse your new mattock on the grass blocks that do not have water anywhere nearby to find some seeds.

And do not plant any of these rewards in the middle of your base.[/warn]

# Quest: Tanned Leather
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB5g.name=§2§lTanned Leather
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB5g.desc=You have found a way to make leather more durable and resistant by further processing it.

Stockpile some for later.

# Quest: Need More Space?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB5w.name=§2§lNeed More Space?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB5w.desc=As you might know: tanned leather is more resistant and good enough for a backpack. Let's get a digger's backpack and a miner's backpack. Each pack holds different items. So use both for your first true back-packed mining experience.

# Quest: Sleeping Outside
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB6w.name=§2§lSleeping Outside

# Quest: Sheep Hairdresser
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB7A.name=§2§lSheep Hairdresser

# Quest: XP Usage?!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8g.name=§2§lXP Usage?!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8g.desc=Exploring some dungeons or fighting mobs probably gave you a lot of XP. Better use it to get iron, copper, tin, or other useful dusts before you die.%n%nPlace your tank on the ground and a drain on top. Now you can fill it with XP.%n%nBy the way, you discovered that while the seared tank doesn't hold much, it doesn't lose contents when broken, and full tanks can stack. I wonder if that information is useful...

# Quest: Better Than Barrels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC1w.name=§1§2§lBetter Than Barrels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC1w.desc=While barrels offer a slot for a single item, drawers can have up to 4 slots each, holding 16 stacks per slot.%n%nHowever, they do come with some downsides.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFw.name=§1§2§lRedstone, Early Game Processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFw.desc=Are you wondering how to process raw redstone ore without a macerator?%n%nUse the hammer in the crafting table to get some crushed redstone ore from your raw redstone ore. After that, use the hammer in the crafting table again to get some impure redstone dust.%n%nLastly, fill a cauldron with water and drop the whole stack of dust into it, either manually or by pressing Ctrl+Q. The cauldron can handle the entire stack with the same amount of water.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADsQ.name=§2§lChad - A Better Way to Make Paper
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADsQ.desc=Making paper out of wood pulp and water can be tedious and difficult. Why not use a mortar to grind the sugar cane into chad and press it with two stone slabs to paper? Later on you can use the chemical bath for an even better ratio.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF4A.desc=The Ore Finder Wand reduces the tedium of locating needed veins. If you're not sure how to craft Magnetic Iron Rod for it, check its Shapeless Crafting tab in NEI.%n%nOnce you put an ore sample into the wand, it will tell you if this ore is nearby. When you get close to the target, you will hear the sound, and the wand will tilt down to the point of being upside-down if there's a lot of target ore nearby.%n%nUse NEI to figure out which ore is the best for your search. If you don't have the needed ore, some basic ones can be purchased in the Coins tab.%n%nOpen the wand's inventory with Shift+RMB when looking at the ground. Put the sample ore into the slot.%nThe rod has a 60-block range both up and down, so it can miss a vein that is located very low or if you are above the sea level.%n%nThe rod appears to work based on the GT's Material system, so anything of the same material will work.%nThat includes crushed ores, dusts, ingots, gems, rods, you name it. For things that don't belong to a particular Material, the rod appears to search only for that exact block - for instance, you won't detect small ores with the usual ore block.%n%nIf the detected ore is a part of a vein, you will see a discovery message in the chat, and the vein will be automatically logged into the visual prospecting tab of your journey map.%n%nThe wand also works from inventory and hotbar, so you don't need to be actively holding it, but you get style points if you do.%n%nThe ore in the wand is stored with the player, not the wand. In other words, remove the ore if you want to give the wand to your teammate.%n%nThe Ore Finder Wand doesn't work in space! The vast cosmic energies of the sun interfere with its inner workings!

If you place the plates on either side of a door, it will open when you step on it. Or a monster does. Double doors will open together.%n%nYou'll need to use Oak for this quest. Purchase some saplings from the Coins tab if you don't have any nearby.%n%nPressure plates will send a redstone signal when an entity is on top of them. There are different types, like items or not, or mobs/player/any entity/etc.%n%nButtons will emit one for about 2 seconds before resetting.%n%nLevers will emit a signal until switched back off.

# Quest: Got a Flat Tire?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJYg.name=§2§lGot a Flat Tire?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJYg.desc=The crowbar is the GT tool used to remove a cover off of a machine, pipe, or wire. Covers can be decorative, functional like pumps and conveyors, or for safety, like putting a wooden plank over your steam pipes so they don't burn you.%n%nSorry, it only comes in blue!%n%nYes, we know there are also red crowbars, but they are from Railcraft and generally inferior. Better ignore them.

# Quest: Too Many Leaves
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKoA.name=§2§lToo Many Leaves
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKoA.desc=Want to clear out shrubbery but don't want to pull out leaves by hand? Need to find that last log hidden in the middle of a bunch of leaves?%n%nTry an Iron Scythe! When used, it clears out a 5x5x5 area of leaves, crops, flowers, or grass. Excellent for tearing through Sacred Oak leaves or dense shrubbery in certain biomes. Later when you have a Cutting Machine you can upgrade to a Diamond Scythe with a 7x7x7 area of effect, or use Amethyst for 9x9x9 to FLEX.%n%nThe lower tiers break leaves instantly but don't seem to have the 3x3x3 range for some reason.

# Quest: Personally, I Prefer Pepsi™
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKoQ.name=§2§lPersonally, I Prefer Pepsi™
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKoQ.desc=You may have noticed that you can make more than just Charcoal in a Coke Oven, you can also make Coke.%n%nYou want to save all of your Coke for making Steel in your Bricked Blast Furnace (BBF) later on. As for everything else, check NEI for the uses of each Coal variant, since there are many.%n%n[note]Once you get to the Steam Age, you can compress your Sugar and Cactus Coke for higher efficiency just like regular Coal and Charcoal.[/note]

# Quest: More Food, More Hearts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKsQ.name=§2§lMore Food, More Hearts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKsQ.desc=So, food is great, right? But what's even greater is eating tons of it! Too boring and pointless you say? Well, what if I told you, that you can get extra hearts just by expanding your palate. You get 1 point for every half shank of hunger from a food eaten, and after 50 points, you get 1 extra heart! Now you have a reason to make all those Pam's foods. Each food contributes its shank-value once. Eating something from a lunch box counts as if you took it out and ate it manually.%n%nIf you want to see what foods you've eaten, you can use the Food Journal, but it's clunky. Realistically, you want to use NEI to both see foods eaten and not eaten. You can search for 'not yet eaten' to see foods left, and 'assisted' to see foods eaten. You need to have started diminishing returns first to see this.%n%nIf it doesn't work, go to NEI options at bottom-left when the inventory is open, then click on Inventory, and change Search Mode to Regex. Then restart your client and try searching again.§r%n%nThere are also two commands:%n%n/foodlist size%nTells you the overall progress, and the progress to the next heart.%n%n/foodlist sync <PlayerName>%nSync your food progression with the server if it gets out of sync.

# Quest: Loot Games
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALPA.name=§2§lLoot Games
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALPA.desc=It looks like you've found a secret room hidden...not so deep within the earth. Pretty close to the surface, actually. You can find these all over the place, and have a chance at sweet sweet loot if you're good at simon says. It counts the highest level you completed, so you can fail the other rounds on purpose to go faster if you don't think you can do better. BTW, cheaters go to minecraft hell, where all the blocks have hardness -1.%n%nIf you fail with Minesweeper, it blows up. Be sure to make room for escape!%n%nMake sure that no water or oil is flowing into the room because of worldgen, or it will kill you and destroy your grave because of 'cheating'. This is a bug.

# Quest: The power of prospecting!
betterquesting.quest.bMKIeFhNQluRks9YzpqEGQ.name=§6§lThe power of prospecting!
betterquesting.quest.bMKIeFhNQluRks9YzpqEGQ.desc=At the top of your map screen (J by default) there are multiple tabs, some of them will be very useful and will save you a ton of searching!%n%nGT Oreveins - this tab will keep track of the veins for you, to save a vein to map right-click a naturally generated ore (some tools can't right-click)%nGT Underground fluids - this will help you later (MV)%nTC Nodes - this tab will keep track of thaumcraft nodes for you (you need to scan them first)%n%n[note]Small Ores are not part of veins and thus do not uncover a vein on the map. However veins generate extra small ores related to the vein in their chunks, so they can still be useful in your search (though not all small ores are related to a nearby vein so don't be fooled).[/note]%n%n[note]Another great interaction is that you can use the NEI search bar in highlight mode (double-click it) and then go to the map screen to get the matching uncovered ore veins highlighted![/note]

# Quest: Sustainable Paper
betterquesting.quest.bbaqMVmnQFyjDT-CHJKqQQ.name=Sustainable Paper
betterquesting.quest.bbaqMVmnQFyjDT-CHJKqQQ.desc=Now that you got your first paper, it's time for a better way to get more. With paperbark you can do just that.%n%nOnce grown you can obtain paper by right clicking the logs of the tree. The bark regrows in due time.

# Quest: Your First Flint Sword
betterquesting.quest.h_PK8qnyR9CBUoOhT9nwzA.name=§2§lYour First Flint Sword
betterquesting.quest.h_PK8qnyR9CBUoOhT9nwzA.desc=It's time to upgrade your wooden sword a little.%nCollect flint bones and a stick.%n%nYou won't be able to kill a Wither with it now, but you can upgrade and improve this tool later. You can also repair it with flint.

# Quest: NEI is EVEN MORE POWERFUL NOW?
betterquesting.quest.pl7uw8oSRhe6L4DmTRfrOQ.name=§2§lNEI is EVEN MORE POWERFUL NOW?
betterquesting.quest.pl7uw8oSRhe6L4DmTRfrOQ.desc=NEI now automatically collapses similar items into one slot making browsing much faster! To collapse/uncollapse a group use ALT+LMB.%nYou can also create your own presets with custom groups!%n%n[note]You can disable this functionality in NEI settings[/note]%n%nAlso now NEI has JEI-like Advanced Search:%n%n@ - search by mod (@minecraft)%n%n[note]There are even more special characters that you can use but most of them are off by default (e.g. no need to use # to search in tooltip), below are all the special characters, check which ones are on/off in NEI settings.%n%nSpace is used as a logical AND between different conditions%n# - search by tooltip (#UV-Tier)%n& - search by id: (&95:15 extratrees:door)%n$ - search by ore dictionary ($ore)%n%% - search by subsets (%%block)%n| - logical or. multi-item search (wrench|hammer)%n- - logical not. exclude items that match the following expression (-@minecraft)%n" - multiple words wrapped in quotes are treated as one condition rather than several ("White Stained Glass")%n%nSearch Mode (apply on search parts, not full string):%nPlain - simple string%nExtended - allow only ?, * rules (by default)%nRegex - allow full regex%n%nIn Extended Search Mode:%n? - any character (@min?craft)%n* - any few characters (@m*ft = @minecraft)%nr/.../ - standard java regex (@r/m\w{6}ft/ = @minecraft)[/note]%n%n[note]You can disable this functionality in NEI settings.[/note]%n%nYou can add bookmarks with the A key while hovering over an item, also:%nHold SHIFT to bookmark the whole recipe%nHold CTRL to bookmark number of items%nHold SHIFT + CTRL to bookmark both recipe and all the number of all the items it contains


## Quest Line: Tier 0.5 - Steam
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg.name=Tier 0.5 - Steam
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg.desc=Steam to electricity (EU) is the progression of this tab. Most of the machines you make in this tier you'll use the whole game, if in an upgraded form.

# Quest: Better Tank... Iron Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEA.name=§3§lBetter Tank... Iron Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEA.desc=Storing more than 16 buckets of fluid in one tank? Sure! Just make an iron tank or upgrade the Buildcraft tank.%n%nDiamond tanks carry up to 64 buckets and obsidian ones are blast proof. There's even more past that, but you should probably use GT tanks or large cells instead.

# Quest: Welcome to Tier 0.5, Steam!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALA.name=§3§lWelcome to Tier 0.5, Steam!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALA.desc=Welcome, and well done so far! This tier is all about your first machines, getting more stuff from your ores and making bronze ingots in a more efficient manner.%n%nFor water, check out the Water Siding Tank multiblock in the Multiblock goals tab.%n%nTo connect up your boilers, be sure to provide water from the bottom, they'll accept only water from this side, so no risk of melting your pipe. Wooden pipes are fine for this. Make sure you never run out of water - [warn]adding water to a dry hot boiler will cause it to explode![/warn]%n%nSteam will come out from the sides. Remember, steam is hot! It will destroy wooden pipes. And it can burn you if you walk on bronze pipes full of steam. Cover them with wooden planks or paper. Or just don't walk on/next to them.%n%nAnd no, you can't automate it. Make an electric one if you want to do that.

# Quest: More Advanced Alloys
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALg.name=§3§lMore Advanced Alloys
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALg.desc=Your smeltery does a great job mixing metals into alloys, but it's not very efficient, and limited in its complexity. You need something new, so why not put your steam to some use? The Alloy Smelter can make bronze for you directly, using ingots, dusts, or even nuggets. You can make a nugget mold as well to turn ingots into nuggets if you have steel.%n%nIt might also come in handy when processing raw rubber. You should keep an eye on recipes to see when machines offer better options to make items...%n%n[note]NOTE: Like all steam machines, the output port is a steam outlet when recipes complete. It must not be blocked. Also, steam is hot, remember? Change the output side by whacking the machine with a wrench. The 3x3 grid will show you which side the output will move to when you whack it.[/note]%n%nYou can empty the machine by putting a hopper beneath it.%n%n[warn]WARNING: The Alloy Smelter recipes take a lot of steam.[/warn] Do them one by one until you understand how fast you use steam, and how much you will need buffered. Large pipes are a decent "poor man's" buffer, and the boiler can hold quite a bit of steam, as well as the machine itself. Once you get a little further along, make a larger steam buffer with an iron or steel railcraft tank.

# Quest: Upgrade: High Speed Alloys
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALw.name=§3§lUpgrade: High Speed Alloys
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALw.desc=Like most machines, there is a more advanced version of the alloy smelter. It uses the same total amount of steam as its predecessor but does the job twice as fast.%n%nKeep in mind that it uses quite a lot of steam, so you better have enough of it in boilers, pipes, or tanks.

# Quest: A Very Important Alloy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMA.name=§3§lA Very Important Alloy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMA.desc=The most important alloy (until you reach a higher tier) is undoubtedly red alloy. Fortunately, you have an alloy smelter, so grab some redstone and combine it with copper to get yourself a handful of that.%n%nDon't confuse your bronze with your copper or else you'll be scratching your head.

# Quest: The Hell is That?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQ.name=§3§lThe Hell is That?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQ.desc=In order to get more machines, you'll need pistons. But not those amateurish ones, you need special ones, and I shall guide you in the making of them.%n%n§3PS: Infernals can drop them, though you won't get credit for the quest that way.

# Quest: Macerator v1.0!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMg.name=§3§lMacerator v1.0!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMg.desc=Finally you are able to make a device that will replace your mortar. However, the "no-durability" feature of this device comes with a cost: You need 2 diamonds for the grinding heads.%n%nThe macerator will double your ore output. Put ores through it instead of smelting directly.%n%n§3NOTE: Remember, don't block the output port and don't stand behind it.§r

# Quest: Extracting Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMw.name=§3§lExtracting Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMw.desc=As you'll need rubber later to make cables from wires, you should get yourself a steam extractor. You can also use this machine to get more dyes from flowers, or process different fruits into juice.

# Quest: A Clear View
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANA.name=§3§lA Clear View
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANA.desc=Are you still living in your dirt/cobble hut? How about letting in some sunlight? Grind up some sand and flint and craft some glass dust. Put it in your smeltery and pour it into a casting basin to make clear glass.%n%n[note]Hint: In order to use it for recipes, you have to chisel it.[/note]%n%n[note]PS: The macerator no longer gives tiny piles, just uncraft a normal pile to get tiny ones. You'll appreciate this once you have a mixer in LV.[/note]

# Quest: Hammer time v2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANQ.name=§3§lHammer time v2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANQ.desc=Using 6 ingots to craft a hammer seems pretty wasteful, as this tool has durability. How nice would it be to have a machine that does the same but without having durability and using three ingots to make two plates? Guess what, there is one! And you should totally get one.

# Quest: Compressing Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANg.name=§3§lCompressing Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANg.desc=This rather simple device does a very important job: compression. Its main function is to press 9 ingots into a block, but it's also useful for a variety of recipes, for example making firm tofu.

# Quest: Upgrade: A Better Compressor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANw.name=§3§lUpgrade: A Better Compressor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANw.desc=An updated version of the steam compressor. Uses the same total amount of steam as its predecessor but does the job twice as fast.

# Quest: Upgrade: Forge Hammer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOA.name=§3§lUpgrade: Forge Hammer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOA.desc=An updated version of the steam forge hammer. Uses the same total amount of steam as its predecessor but does the job twice as fast.

# Quest: Upgrade: Extractor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOQ.name=§3§lUpgrade: Extractor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOQ.desc=An updated version of the steam extractor. Uses the same total amount of steam as its predecessor but does the job twice as fast.%n%nYou probably want to craft this, as the extractor does also extract your nerves...

# Quest: Upgrade: Better Macerator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOg.name=§3§lUpgrade: Better Macerator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOg.desc=An updated version of the steam macerator. Uses the same total amount of steam as its predecessor but does the job twice as fast.

# Quest: Steam Alternatives
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOw.name=§3§lSteam Alternatives
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOw.desc=There is more than one way to get steam for your machines. This completely optional questline shows you some alternative methods for producing steam.%n%n§3For the ones that need glass, you'll need to progress a few more quests to see how to do so, though you can also make it now if you know how to use NEI to find the recipe.

# Quest: Upgrade: Coal Boiler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPA.name=§3§lUpgrade: Coal Boiler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPA.desc=This is basically just an upgrade to your current coal boiler, however it produces more than twice as much steam. Something you should consider building if you're planning to get some of the upgraded machines.

# Quest: Another Use for Java, I Mean Lava
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPQ.name=§3§lAnother Use for Java, I Mean Lava
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPQ.desc=Now that you have Steel, you can craft a sturdy enough Boiler to handle Lava. Steam is only outputted in the back, and you require Water input on the side and Lava input on the top. But as an added benefit, this Boiler will reward you with Obsidian!%n%n§3Did you know? Over 3 billion machines run on Lava!

# Quest: The Power of the Sun
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPg.name=§3§lThe Power of the Sun
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPg.desc=The sun has quite a bit of power, so why not use it to produce Steam?%n%nFill it with Water on the bottom side to produce Steam. Unlike the other Boilers, this only outputs Steam on the output port side.%n%nYou need Silver from small ores to craft Solar Boilers. Later in LV you can get much more in the Twilight Forest.%n%n§3Hint: The Simple Solar Boiler calcifies and becomes less efficient over time, dropping down to a minimum of 40L/s. Later on you can consider using Distilled Water to avoid calcification.

# Quest: Using Steam to Cook Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPw.name=§3§lUsing Steam to Cook Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPw.desc=A rather slow process, but it's more efficient than using a regular furnace.

# Quest: Upgrade: Better Furnace
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQA.name=§3§lUpgrade: Better Furnace
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQA.desc=An updated version of the steam furnace. Uses the same total amount of steam as its predecessor but does the job twice as fast.

# Quest: Blastoff!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQ.name=§3§lBlastoff!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQ.desc=It's about time to make some steel. Look in the Multiblock Goals quest tab and build a Bricked Blast Furnace. Return here once you've made at least 8 steel ingots.

# Quest: Time For Some Logic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQg.name=§3§lTime For Some Logic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQg.desc=Good news! You are now able to advance to the next tier! Bad news: You still have to craft a lot of things before you can begin. Fear not mortal, I shall guide you!

# Quest: Wired, Weird?!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQw.name=§3§lWired, Weird?!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQw.desc=Two of the very basic materials for machines are wires and cables. For cables you can either use a rubber sheet in the crafting table or use rubber bars in the alloy smelter. Not very efficient, but there will be a better way later.

# Quest: Your First Electronic Circuit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARA.name=§3§lYour First Electronic Circuit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARA.desc=Steam machines are quite stupid, they just do one thing over and over again. As you advance into the electrical age, you've decided that you want the machines to have more features, like automatic output in order to create some automation. For that, you need electronic circuits.

# Quest: Wire-Wrap
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQ.name=§3§lWire-Wrap
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQ.desc=Placing wires without insulation seems to be a bad idea. Now that you have an extractor to extract raw rubber out of sticky resin and an alloy smelter to further process it using sulfur, you should work on getting some insulating rubber bars.

# Quest: Basic Crafting: Motors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARw.name=§3§lBasic Crafting: Motors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARw.desc=Motors are little devices that can turn electrical power into rotational energy. Very useful for all kind of machines, and not that difficult to craft. The pattern is always the same, only the materials change with tiers. For now you can use redstone to magnetize your iron rod. Later on you will build an Electromagnetic Polarizer.

# Quest: Basic Crafting: Rotors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASA.name=§3§lBasic Crafting: Rotors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASA.desc=Rotors are also crafted using an identical pattern with different materials. A bit annoying to craft at the moment, but you don't need a lot of them anyway.

# Quest: Basic Crafting: Machine Hulls
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASQ.name=§3§lBasic Crafting: Machine Hulls
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASQ.desc=All machines need a hull to keep their private parts together. Good news is: They are crafted in the same way for every tier, only the materials change.%n%n§3As noted on the tooltip, you can also use a machine hull to pass EU through, at 1A. This can be useful for a 1A diode on Thermos servers, splitting cables from 4A->1A or in a cleanroom later. You can also pass items or fluids through it.

# Quest: Where Can I Put All the Liquids?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVA.name=§3§lWhere Can I Put All the Liquids?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVA.desc=With your brand new alloy smelter you are able to combine two materials. What happens if you mix some obsidian dust and thickened glass? Obsidian glass, great. Your first tank that you can make would be a Buildcraft tank. This tank can carry up 16 buckets of a single fluid. It's possible to upgrade those tanks so they can hold up to 64 buckets.%nYou can also stack the tanks to increase capacity.

# Quest: A Quite Different Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdw.name=§3§lA Quite Different Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdw.desc=Regular chests can fill up rather quickly if you happen to collect mob drops like swords and/or armor. By using a cabinet, you can store up to 270 items of the same type. Also, it doesn't need a dolly - you can break it normally and it will retain contents.%n%nPerfect for storing IC2 crop seeds, Forestry saplings, or bees!

# Quest: Flint and Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB3g.name=§3§lFlint and Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB3g.desc=After you make steel you are able to craft flint and steel. I guess you'll want to travel to the Nether as soon as possible but be aware; the Nether is a very dangerous place.%n%nNote: The ball of moss gives a tinker's tool self-repair. But if the tool is completely broken, it won't repair it.%n%nNote that the flint and steel can take a few times to work.

# Quest: THE NETHER
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB3w.name=§3§lTHE NETHER
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB3w.desc=Now more dangerous with extra hardcore infernal mobs. Have fun and take care. Remember that the flint and steel can take a few times to work, but there are other ways to make fire ...%n%nBe sure to bring a tough companion along to keep you alive. If you have no friends, why not make an Iron Golem and push it through first, or bring the materials for more along with you?%n%nAlso, §lwhen§r you die here, not if, your graves will spawn skeletons because of the darkness. Make sure you light up areas where you might die, and when recovering graves light up the area §lfirst§r so that you don't end up dying over and over and making a mess.%n%nWatch out for some mobs! They'll take minimal damage from any weapon that is not their weakness. So if you seem to not be doing much damage, you probably aren't! Think about other options to hurt/kill the monster.

# Quest: Wiremill v0.2 Alpha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB7Q.name=§3§lWiremill v0.2 Alpha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB7Q.desc=Small gears require a wire cutter to be made, so let's craft one.

# Quest: Ooo, Shiny! (Not Platinum!)
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB7w.name=§3§lOoo, Shiny! (Not Platinum!)
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB7w.desc=To make your first macerator you need two diamonds, and to enter the Twilight Forest you need one. Finding a diamond vein would help you a lot. Go and look for one at Y 5-20.

# Quest: How to Make Rubber
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8A.name=§3§lHow to Make Rubber
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8A.desc=Making rubber is now more complicated - you need raw rubber and sulfur. Finding a sulfur vein in the Nether seems like a good idea, doesn't it? Found on Y 5-20. Later on you can get sulfur from chemicals like hydrogen sulfide or pyrite.%n%n[warn]Sphalerite will be important later for gallium and zinc. Save it until you can fully process it in LV.[/warn]

# Quest: Lit Way to Get Charred
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8Q.name=§3§lLit Way to Get Charred
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8Q.desc=The "Charcoal Pile Igniter" is an alternative option for mass-producing charcoal. It does not consume any power or steam, but generates a lot of pollution. Follow the steps below to get it working.%n%n1. Build a brick floor no bigger than 11x11 in size.%n2. Place 1-5 layers of logs atop the brick floor. No air gaps allowed.%n3. Place the Charcoal Pile Igniter above the top-center log.%n4. Surround the remaining logs in dirt or grass.%n5. The Charcoal Pile Igniter immediately starts processing%n6. After some time, the logs are converted to brittle charcoal blocks.%n7. Break the blocks with an axe for the charcoal (Luck/Fortune has NO effect on the drop rates).%n%nIf this is your first multiblock, read the extended tooltip (hold shift) for construction requirements, or visit [url]wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Charcoal_Pile_Igniter[/url] for more information and step-by-step images.

# Quest: Tool Forge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5Q.name=§3§lTool Forge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5Q.desc=After getting obzinite, it's time to craft a tool forge for making bigger (and better) Tinkers tools.%n%n§Y§3You do not have to use iron to create the forge; you can also use other materials like tin or copper, among others.

# Quest: One Block Mining is so Old School
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5g.name=§3§lOne Block Mining is so Old School
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5g.desc=By making a hammer you are now able to mine a shaft of 3x3 blocks. You can use iron, steel, or obzinite poured from the Smeltery, it doesn't need to be steel. Higher tier metals require the MV extruder. You'll need a hammer head, two large plates and a large rod for your hammer. Be careful in the Nether or you could be boiled in lava very quickly.%n%n§6The quest should accept the tool whatever materials you used.

# Quest: Cutting a Tree log by log is so Old School
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5w.name=§3§lCutting a Tree log by log is so Old School
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5w.desc=By making a lumber axe, you are now able to cut down an entire tree in one hit. Don't forget your backpack when you're cutting a sacred oak down.%n%nProtip: With wooden equivalents of casts, make a lumber axe completely out of netherrack - lower mining speed means less XP needed to level it up. Use the modifier slots to add Reinforced. Once you've leveled it up enough, upgrade the parts for better ones, such as steel, obzinite, or others. The higher-level metals will require an MV Extruder. Keep in mind that the auto-smelt modifier doesn't work, so don't bother with it.%n%nThe quest will accept a lumber axe from any material.

# Quest: Mining Dirt Block by Block is so Old School
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6A.name=§3§lMining Dirt Block by Block is so Old School
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6A.desc=By making an excavator you are now able to mine dirt in a 3x3 area. You can use iron, steel, or obzinite poured from the Smeltery, it doesn't need to be steel.%n%nHigher tier metals require the MV extruder. Don't destroy your whole garden.%n%n§6The quest should accept the tool whatever materials you used.

# Quest: Pollution What....?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFg.name=§3§lPollution What....?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFg.desc=If you are running your bricked blast furnace for a long time you will sometimes get headaches, nausea and other weird effects. Yes this is pollution... from making so much steel. If you can collect some rubber sheets, I will trade you a complete hazmat suit.

# Quest: Rubber Sheets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGA.name=§3§lRubber Sheets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGA.desc=Let's make a mold for the rubber sheets. They are mainly used for conveyors and cables.%n%nAt this stage, making cables by hand with rubber sheets is faster and cheaper in power than the Alloy Smelter recipe for the cables.%n%nWith the sheets, you should be able to craft Piston Boots - a massive upgrade to your mobility. Check out the questline Getting Around to find them.

# Quest: How Can I Carry All These Items?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACLg.name=§3§lHow Can I Carry All These Items?

# Quest: Better Than Iron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADtA.name=§3§lBetter Than Iron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADtA.desc=But not as good as steel. Mostly, this is used in machine hulls, or in tools if you don't want to use steel up for that.%n%nTo make wrought iron, you need a tinkers smelter to melt some iron ingots down and cast nuggets; or use an ingot and a saw to get your nuggets. Now put these in a furnace to get wrought iron nuggets. With the compressor, you can compress the nuggets into ingots.%n%n§3Hint: Crushed or purified iron ore (not a mixed version like pyrite, look for Iron Ore in Chalcopyrite veins) can be smelted to iron nuggets directly.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEZw.desc=With your steel tool you are able to mine obsidian. You can make the Reinforcement which gives a reinforced modifier which increases the durability of your tool. Reinforced level X makes a tool unbreakable.%n%n§3PS: In many cases this is not worth it, since the tools don't degrade that fast, it doesn't cost much to repair, and you get better materials (with higher durability) to make them out of reasonably fast. Plus, by the time you got it to unbreakable, you'd be auto-mining everything with a miner anyway. Just use redstone, or maybe luck/silky. However, there are a few very nice use cases like lumber axes and tools for automation setups.

# Quest: Lapis? Lucky!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEaA.name=§3§lLapis? Lucky!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEaA.desc=Maybe you were lucky and received the luck modifier on your pickaxe.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAXQ.desc=The second item you'll need a lot of. When you want to get fluid out of tanks you'll need one.%n%nAttach it to fluid pipes or GT machines/blocks. Adjust the flow direction and redstone behavior with a screwdriver. Place it on the side facing the tank or machine. When looking at a pipe or machine, you can use the grid to place it on a side already touching another thing. You can use the grid with a screwdriver to adjust a cover on that side as well.%n%nWhen a GT pipe or machine has any cover, including a pump cover, wrenching the machine back into an item keeps the cover on that machine. The cover stays with the machine in the same direction when it is placed down again. This way you can arrange pump and conveyor covers on a machine outside a tight spot and place it there. To remove covers, use the crowbar.%n%nIt can also be further upgraded into a fluid regulator that allows precise control of fluid transfer speed.%n%nYou can access covers interface with Shift+RMB.

# Quest: Electric Macerator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAXg.name=§5§lElectric Macerator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAXg.desc=It is highly recommended to get one of these, as the efficiency in terms of coal/steam used to macerate something is a lot better when using EU.%n%nYou get the first extra slot at HV, then +1 for EV and IV. The 2nd slot is for more byproducts, and is super §osuper§r useful. The 3rd slot is for ore block dusts. The 4th slot is basically only used for recycling stuff.%n%n[note]You can also consider using the steam multiblock instead if you want.[/note]

# Quest: You're Gonna Hate This #3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAXw.name=§5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAXw.desc=A piston, but more... "electrical". The third item you're going to craft a lot of in the future.

# Quest: Saving Redstone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYA.name=§5§lSaving Redstone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYA.desc=Tired of using 4 redstone for 1 magnetic iron rod? Well, good news for you! The polarizer doesn't need redstone, just a little bit of power. You don't need to attach this machine to a permanent power source, it runs fine on battery power, since it uses so little.

# Quest: Avengers, Assemble!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYQ.name=§5§lAvengers, Assemble!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYQ.desc=An absolute must have for fans of the movie. Oh, and to make all the things, of course. There are a number of recipes that take fewer materials to make in the assembler, or can only be made with it, so make it ASAP!%n%nYou can use the battery slot and the other extra slot in the GUI to store unused configuration circuits.%n%nIf you've completed the Silverwood quest on the first tab, you can go to the Twilight Forest after making your Assembler. See the Novice Thaumaturgy tab for details.

# Quest: No More Filing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYg.name=§5§lNo More Filing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYg.desc=Why waste a full ingot to make a rod by using a tool which loses durability and takes even MORE ingots? With this little device, all your rod-needs shall be fulfilled (for now at least, the MV Extruder is the next step for rods).

# Quest: Press All the Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZA.name=§5§lPress All the Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZA.desc=With the basic forming press you can make different food items, glass arrows and some Project Red components.%n%nAt MV/HV stage you can make rotors, various AE components and make copies of your molds and extruder shapes.

# Quest: Mjolnir!!!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZQ.name=§5§lMjolnir!!!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZQ.desc=Not really required, but it is a lot faster than the steam one and it can be automated. If you feel like ore washing is too slow, use this hammer.%n%n[note]You can also consider using the steam multiblock instead if you want.[/note]

# Quest: Cutting Things Apart
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZg.name=§5§lCutting Things Apart
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZg.desc=An absolutely mandatory machine to have. It will cut rods into bolts, plates into casings, logs into planks, and all of that will be done with the highest possible efficiency. Totally worth it!%n%nYou can use water, distilled water, or lubricant to run it. Use lubricant if possible, as it's the best.

# Quest: Getting Ready for Tier 2, MV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZw.name=§5§lGetting Ready for Tier 2, MV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZw.desc=In order to proceed forward, you need to get aluminium. A lot of it. But for now, 8 is enough to complete this quest.%n%nYour first option is alumina dust. Probably the best source for alumina is clay or hardened clay from canyons, however you need an MV machine for that, so you need to find an alternative until you have enough dust for your initial setup. For now, you can get it by centrifuging various impure piles from your ores or by smelting ruby, sapphire, or green sapphire in an EBF with carbon. Check the EBF quest in the Multiblock Goals.%n%nYou will also need an EBF to turn the alumina into aluminium ingots. For that you need cryolite. Go visit the Twilight Forest for that and find a Cryolite vein. The related quest is "Lead, Galena, Silver and Cryolite" is the Novice Thaumaturgy tab.%n%nYour second option is to use aluminium dust. However, you can not smelt that directly yet, even if you have an EBF. That will require higher heat levels. For now, you will have to either use a Tinker's Smeltery or a GT Compressor to turn the dust into raw aluminium which you can then smelt into ingots in the EBF.%n%nBy the time you've completed this, you'll probably be done with most of the tab, but you'll still need Good Circuits (MV) to actually open up the next tier if you haven't done that yet.%n%nYou might also want to check the Getting Around and Without Dying tabs for new unlocks.%n%n[note]If you were exploring Twilight Forest before 2.1.1.4 you won't find any cryolite in existing veins. You'll need to explore new chunks.[/note]

# Quest: Your Magic Progression
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaA.name=§5§lYour Magic Progression
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaA.desc=Now that you're able to produce Aluminium, you may dig into magic. If you haven't unlocked basic thaumaturgy, try to find a Silverwood and a Greatwood sapling.%n%nThere is a coin quest that lets you purchase these saplings. If you haven't found any yet, go check it out!

# Quest: Saving Metal With Bending
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaQ.name=§5§lSaving Metal With Bending
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaQ.desc=Instead of a 3:2 ratio of ingots to plates, this machine allows for 1:1. This saves an enormous amount of metal, so make it ASAP.%n%nBTW if you want foils, just run the plate back through. There are other circuit modes, but you can discover them later.

# Quest: Basic Transport Pipe
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcQ.name=§5§lBasic Transport Pipe
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcQ.desc=These pipes are rather simple and won't do anything on their own. But in combination with transfer nodes, you'll soon find out how great they are.

# Quest: Basic Transport: Items
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcg.name=§5§lBasic Transport: Items
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcg.desc=In order to transfer items, you need so called "nodes". There are some for pushing items into a pipe system, and later you'll have access to nodes that are able to pull items from attached inventories.

# Quest: Basic Transport: Fluids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcw.name=§5§lBasic Transport: Fluids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcw.desc=Just like item nodes, liquid nodes transfer... liquids. But probably the best thing: They can all utilize the same transfer pipe!

# Quest: Alloy Smelter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdA.name=§5§lAlloy Smelter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdA.desc=Upgrade your steam alloy smelter to an LV one.

# Quest: Gotta Catch 'em All
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdQ.name=§5§lGotta Catch 'em All
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdQ.desc=Sure, you can use wheat/potatoes/carrots to make animals follow you back to your base, but that can be tedious. A golden lasso is a proper solution for animal transportation.%n%nYou can use it for §oany§r passive mob, like for getting villagers back to base, or a horse across a river.

# Quest: Basic Monster Prevention
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdg.name=§5§lBasic Monster Prevention
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdg.desc=Monsters spawning in or near your base can be annoying. Especially if you happen to get infernal creepers. Luckily, there's a good way to prevent them from spawning at all.

# Quest: Chemical Rubber Production
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC1g.name=§5§lChemical Rubber Production
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC1g.desc=A much more efficient way to make insulated cables is by making molten rubber in a chemical reactor, which can be applied to a cable in the assembling machine. When you put both machines next to each other you can output the molten rubber directly to the assembling machine by clicking the fluid auto-output button on the chemical reactor. Make sure to set the correct side of the reactor as output side by wrenching it. Also remember to use the right circuit in the assembling machine.

# Quest: Glue
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6Q.name=§5§lGlue
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6Q.desc=To make Good Circuit Boards, you need either glue or refined glue.%n%nYou can obtain refined glue either by centrifuging sticky resin or distilling glue. Note that it is GT glue, not Tinkers' Construct glue.%n%nAlternatively, you can extract glue from slime trees that you can obtain from slime islands in the sky.

# Quest: Diodes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6w.name=§5§lDiodes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6w.desc=Good circuits need diodes. There are two main ways to craft them. You can crush the Gallium Arsenide crystals to dust and combine that with fine copper wires and molten glass. Once you have solar grade silicon you can use it to make silicon wafers in your EBF to make even more. Note that the wafers are much more efficient on gallium and arsenic, so even a reduced amount is still worth it.%n%nMake sure you check all the NEI recipes for advanced items instead of just using the first one you find. You can use annealed copper wires and polyethylene to increase your output even more.

# Quest: Empty Circuit Board
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC7A.name=§5§lEmpty Circuit Board
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC7A.desc=Good circuit boards require wooden pulp and refined glue to make phenolic circuit boards. By adding gold wire you can craft a good circuit board.%n%nThere are more efficient ways to make it if you look in NEI.

# Quest: You're Gonna Hate This #5
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEQ.name=§5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #5
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEQ.desc=The fifth item you'll need a lot of. For the microwave, the scanner, the precision laser engraver, etc.%n%nThe Emitter and Sensor aren't used as much as the other items, fortunately.

# Quest: You're Gonna Hate This #6
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEg.name=§5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #6
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEg.desc=The sixth item you'll need a lot of. For the scanner and the seismic prospector.%n%n[note]BTW, there's technically one more, the Field Generator, but you need higher tier circuits to make it, and it isn't used as often until later tiers.[/note]

# Quest: Scanning Bees, Crops and Moooooore!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEw.name=§5§lScanning Bees, Crops and Moooooore!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEw.desc=Automate your bee, sapling, or crop scanning. For crops, this is the only real way to find the crop's stats until you can craft the Portable Scanner, which needs HV circuits that you can make in the next tier.%n%nLater on, this machine gets very useful for scanning high tier machine parts for the assembly line research data or to fill data orbs with data for UUMatter production. Data sticks with raw prospecting data need a scanner too.

# Quest: Basic Ore Washer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGg.name=§5§lBasic Ore Washer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGg.desc=Macerating ores usually doubles the output. If you want MOOOOOOORE, craft an ore washer and wash out some rare materials.%n%nNote that these both use water, and are painfully slow.%n%nPut crushed ore in them.%n%n[note]You can also consider using the steam multiblock instead if you want.[/note]

# Quest: Round and Round and Round...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGw.name=§5§lRound and Round and Round...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGw.desc=After purification of your ore dust, you can centrifuge it to get even more byproducts out of the dust. On top of that, you can process many items into their more useful byproducts with this machine, such as Sticky Resin and Brick Dust.%n%nIt's always useful to check NEI for Centrifuge and Electrolyzer recipes for any item/fluid you may need. It might just be that you can get that from stuff you already have in your base!%n%n[note]Use the checkbox if you rather use the steam multiblock.[/note]

# Quest: A Truly Sharp Saw Blade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHA.name=§5§lA Truly Sharp Saw Blade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHA.desc=Combining cobalt brass and diamond dust makes a really sharp saw blade for your cutting machine.

# Quest: A New Alloy - Cobalt Brass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHQ.name=§5§lA New Alloy - Cobalt Brass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHQ.desc=If you want to cut diamond blocks into plates, it's time to get a new alloy, Cobalt Brass.%n%nFirst you need to make brass out of zinc (only found in small ores or Tico Zinc Gavel Ore in the Overworld, in Nether Sphalerite, or as a centrifuge byproduct from tin or tetrahedrite) and copper. Mix it with tin and cobalt dust (you can get it as a byproduct of a couple ores, go searching in the nether, or go to the Twilight Forest for Cobaltite) to get the cobalt brass dust.%n%nNow that you've come this far, we think that you're able to look up the ores that you need by yourself with the help of NEI.

# Quest: Electrically Separating Dusts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHg.name=§5§lElectrically Separating Dusts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHg.desc=Using the power of electricity you can get even more out of your dusts. Somehow. With no catalysts, electrolytes, or anything. Look, don't ask me how it works. §oIt just works§r.%n%nAside from that, this is a very important machine to process some items and fluids into other, more useful items and fluids. A basic example of this is electrolyzing Water, which should be completely free to you, to get both Hydrogen and Oxygen, two very important fluids for your progression.

# Quest: C9H8O4...NaCl...H2O...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHw.name=§5§lC9H8O4...NaCl...H2O...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHw.desc=Want to make some cetane-boosted diesel, plastic or some chemical dyes? Then it's time to craft a chemical reactor.%n%nYou can use the battery slot and the other extra slot in the GUI to store items.

# Quest: Compact? Or is it?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIA.name=§5§lCompact? Or is it?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIA.desc=It's a compressor but that doesn't mean it's compact...%n%nIt is highly recommended to get one of these electric compressors, as the efficiency in terms of coal/steam used to compress something is a lot better when using EU.%n%n[note]You can also consider using the steam multiblock instead if you want.[/note]

# Quest: Suction Device... Nice
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIQ.name=§3§5§lSuction Device... Nice
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIQ.desc=I hope you're not thinking about what I'm thinking you're thinking about...%n%nIt's highly recommended to get one of these, as the efficiency in terms of coal/steam used to extracting something is a lot better when using EU.

# Quest: Your Oil is Too Crude? Refine it!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIw.name=§5§lYour Oil is Too Crude? Refine it!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIw.desc=Burning oil in the combustion generator is a very inefficient way of producing power. Every bucket/cell of oil only gives you 20,000 EU. Time to refine it.%n%nYou'll need to use a circuit to pick which of the products you want. Later on you can make a Distillation Tower to get all of them, but that's far away for now.%n%nYou can also distill many other fluids! There are two that are useful, but take a long time to distill, so you should set them up in advance:%nLubricant (from Creosote) and Distilled Water (from Water).

# Quest: Light Sulfuric Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJA.name=§5§lLight Sulfuric Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJA.desc=You can distill your oil into light sulfuric fuel, that has a burn value of 40,000 EU.

# Quest: Light Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJQ.name=§5§lLight Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJQ.desc=By adding Hydrogen to Sulfuric Light Fuel in a Chemical Reactor you can produce Light Fuel with the very high burn value of 305,000 EU per cell. It is also the main component of Diesel, an excellent fuel that becomes available in MV%n%nThe remaining Hydrogen Sulfide can be used to produce Sulfuric Acid for, well, tons of stuff. You can never have enough of it! You can also crack Light Fuel in a Chemical Reactor and then distill it to get Ethylene, for Polyethylene. But Refinery Gas is better for that.

# Quest: H for Hydrogen... the Rest of the Alphabet is Too Complicated...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJg.name=§5§lH for Hydrogen... the Rest of the Alphabet is Too Complicated...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJg.desc=Centrifuge some brown or yellow limonite dust, or use an Electrolyzer with water to get some hydrogen.%n%nThere are many other ways of obtaining hydrogen which you might want to look into. Some are only available much later.%n%nExamples are: chemical processing or electrolysis of methane obtained from organic sources, electrolysis of water or salt water, mixing sodium with water, or eventually siphoning hydrogen directly from a gas giant.

# Quest: Heavy Sulfuric Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJw.name=§5§lHeavy Sulfuric Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJw.desc=You can distill your oil into heavy sulfuric fuel, that has a burn value of 80,000 EU.

# Quest: Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKA.name=§5§lHeavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKA.desc=By adding Hydrogen to sulfuric Heavy Fuel in a Chemical Reactor you can produce Heavy Fuel, with a burn value of 360,000 EU per cell! Aside from this, it's also required for Diesel, in MV, which is a better fuel, and it can also be distilled into three very useful fluids: Benzene, Toluene and Phenol.%n%nIf you want to use Heavy Fuel as a power source, you will need Semi-Fluid generators, unlike Light Fuel and Diesel which use Combustion generators.%n%nIt's honestly not especially efficient to make Heavy Fuel out of regular Oil. You should try to get Heavy Oil to make it, like from Oilsands Ore in MV once you can. Then use it to make Diesel.

# Quest: Hey DJ, Mix it!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKg.name=§5§lHey DJ, Mix it!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKg.desc=The mixer is a very useful device. You can mix all kinds of fluids and items. Useful to prevent dust from falling to the ground when crafting - most mixer recipes give a slight boost over hand crafting!%n%nYou get +3 slots in the EV+ versions, this one has 6.%n%nYou can use the battery slot and other extra slots in the GUI to store anything you like!%n%n[note]You can also consider using the steam multiblock instead if you want.[/note]

# Quest: N Like Nitrogen... Hide, the Alphabet Strikes Again!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKw.name=§5§lN Like Nitrogen... Hide, the Alphabet Strikes Again!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKw.desc=You can get some nitrogen by centrifuging... air. This process takes a long time, especially at LV tier.%n%nYou get that air from compressed air cells, which are gotten from running cells through a compressor. Each one contains 2000L, unlike a normal cell that contains 1000L.

# Quest: Molten Redstone?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQw.name=§5§lMolten Redstone?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQw.desc=You heard that the carpenter needs some molten redstone for a few recipes. Converting redstone dust into a fluid requires a fluid extractor. Let's build one.%n%nIf you want to get that molten redstone into a cell, you'll need a fluid canner instead of a GT tank. Why? Because Reasons.%n%nFortunately, most fluids work properly, but redstone, cracked fluids, and certain other ones do not. Or just use a universal cell.

# Quest: Magnetize Your Rods
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACSw.name=§5§lMagnetize Your Rods
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACSw.desc=Magnetic steel rods will §oneed§r a Polarizer to craft. You'll need them later on for MV Motors and MV hatches.

# Quest: Tetrahedrite, Stibnite and Copper
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVQ.name=§5§lTetrahedrite, Stibnite and Copper
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVQ.desc=Maybe you're wondering why you need tetrahedrite or stibnite. Well, antimony can be centrifuged out of it which is very useful for batteries. Batteries store power, so you can have highs and lows in your power production while still outputting stable power.%n%nThe veins can be found between Y level 80-120.

# Quest: Antimony
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVg.name=§5§lAntimony
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVg.desc=The most efficient way to get antimony for batteries is to run stibnite through a BBF or EBF, burning off the impurities (sulfur), and giving you more antimony. You can also centrifuge it if you want to keep the sulfur. You can also centrifuge tetrahedrite dust if you're desperate.

# Quest: Thermal Centrifuge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVw.name=§5§lThermal Centrifuge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVw.desc=A machine to get different byproducts out of your crushed or purified ore dust. It's useful for getting a bit of Gallium out of crushed Zinc Ore for your Diodes needed in good circuits.%n%nWhen you have IC2 nuclear reactors and want to recycle your depleted fuel rods, it's the only way to do so.%n%nIf you can't produce the 2A of LV power for this machine right now, wait until you get to MV and use transformers to power an LV version.%n%nIn LV, you can obtain the same ore byproducts via different methods. The Thermal Centrifuge only becomes really important in HV when you can combine it with the HV macerator.%n%n[warn]Sending MV power to an LV device, even if it uses more than 1A will cause an explosion, so don't do that.[/warn]

# Quest: A Lead About Lead That Leads to Lead
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACYA.name=§2§3§5§lA Lead About Lead That Leads to Lead
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACYA.desc=The next step of making batteries is to collect some lead. Look at the lead quest in the novice thaumaturgy tab for more info.

# Quest: Analyzing the Soil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_w.name=§5§lAnalyzing the Soil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_w.desc=Tired of looking for ores by hand? Want to find underground oil that will last a long time? A seismic prospector will tell you the ores in the surrounding chunks in a (sorta) handy book you can read, and also the underground fluids beneath you. It doesn't need to be powered.%n%nTo determine which kind of fluid there is in the chunk you need to scan the soil by right-clicking an Advanced Seismic Prospector with 2 Powderbarrels, 4 Glyceryl Trinitate cells, 8 iTNT or 16 TNT. This one doesn't explode the user too on use. Features! There are four types of oil or natural gas for the overworld. See the quest in Tips and Tricks once you've made an oil drill.%n%n1) Right-click explosives.%n2) Use a single Data Stick to extract the data by right-clicking on it after the animation has finished. Each will hold ONE result.%n3) Next you need to put the data stick in a GT scanner to have it analyzed.%n4) Place the analyzed data stick in the bottom right slot of a printer and add 3 paper in the top left slot and make sure you have at least 144L squid ink in it.%n5) Take the printed pages and combine it with a piece of leather in an assembling machine filled with at least 20 mb of refined glue.%n%n[note]TADA![/note] Now you have a book with detailed info about the chunks you scanned. Visual Prospecting adds the information to your map the moment you make the book.%n%n§2Data Sticks are not easy (or possible) to make right now, so do not lose them.§r You can put it in a crafting table to erase it when done.%n%nOre locations are given as the center of the chunk. Ores that are marginal in that chunk may not be found in the center but on an edge. Look at where ores are located and determine the center of the vein. At higher tiers, it scans more chunks for ores. If you just want to know about fluids, use the lower tier version so the book isn't as long.%n%nEach underground fluid field is 8x8 chunks. This starts at 0,0 and continues for 8 chunks east and south, containing 64 chunks. Not all fields have anything in them though. Within the field the amount can vary +/- 25 percent. The amount reported in the book is the minimum and maximum per field across all chunks in the field. The prospector reports on 3x3 fields (as in, 9 fields of 8x8 chunks) at all tiers with the center field where the seismic prospector is located. Fluid extraction rate depends on many factors, check the wiki for details. In general, anything above 300 is really good. The total amount in the chunk is complicated.

# Quest: Mercury
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaA.name=§5§lMercury
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaA.desc=Mercury can be centrifuged out of redstone. If you find some cinnabar ore in a redstone vein or one of the infused stone veins you can use that too.

# Quest: Fluid Canner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaQ.name=§5§lFluid Canner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaQ.desc=The fluid canner used to be the main way to fill cells, single-use batteries, and coolant cells. It was needed because direct interaction with cells was limited.%n%nNow everything is much easier and cells almost always work as expected, so you likely won't need this, even for molten redstone.%n%nHowever, if you want an electric hoe or treetap, you'll need to make IC2 batteries in a fluid canner.%n%nAnother interesting thing about this is it also works as a fluid uncanner. And maybe later you could fill a Lighter with it.

# Quest: Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACag.name=§5§lSulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACag.desc=Combining sulfur trioxide and water in the chemical reactor will give you sulfuric acid for your single use acid batteries. You'll need to make sulfur dioxide first.%n%nOn the other hand if you've made some light fuel you'll have some spare hydrogen sulfide you can also turn into sulfuric acid (after a couple steps), and if you've automated it, you'll be drowning in it honestly. Once you can make an LCR, you can skip directly from HS to SA in one step. Keep in mind that you'll need all that acid for making stuff instead of for single use batteries by then.

# Quest: IC2 Battery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACbA.name=§5§lIC2 Battery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACbA.desc=A few recipes require IC2 batteries. Fill your small battery hull with some molten redstone and you'll get an RE-Battery.

Later on you can get a lot more in different ways.

# Quest: Cadmium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACbw.name=§5§lCadmium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACbw.desc=You can get Cadmium from Sphalerite (centrifuge or thermal centrifuge). Later on you can use GT++ Ore processing chains to get Cadmium from Rare Earths. I don't care how you get it, just get some Cadmium.

# Quest: Basic Canner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACcA.name=§5§lBasic Canner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACcA.desc=The canning machine is used to fill batteries, fill cells with stuff (usually dust, not used that often), or to fill tin cans with any kind of food (HV+).%n%nAt LV-HV tier you can make batteries with sodium, cadmium, or lithium.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACcg.name=§5§lPortable Mob Spawners...? Cool!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACcg.desc=Do you want to move a spawner around and build a cool mob farm? That will be no problem if you get the diamond dolly. You can move 6 spawners before the durability runs out, which is probably more than you'll need right now.

# Quest: Sulfuric Naphtha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACfw.name=§5§lSulfuric Naphtha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACfw.desc=Another distillate you can make out of oil is sulfuric naphtha with a burn value of 40,000 EU per cell in the gas turbine.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgA.desc=Centrifuging Butane or Propane gives you LPG with a burn value of 320,000 EU, the same as naphtha.

# Quest: Naphtha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgQ.name=§5§lNaphtha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgQ.desc=You can process Sulfuric Naphtha to fluid Naphtha which has a burn value of 220,000 EU in the Gas Turbine. Naphtha can be used to get Ethylene for Polyethylene, but it shares this use with Refinery Gas and Light Fuel, so decide for yourself which one you want to use.%n%nIf you choose to make High-Octane Gasoline in EV and onwards, it will need a lot of Naphtha. You can also make Polycaprolactam (Nylon), which doesn't have any useful purpose yet, but it might get some in the near future.

# Quest: Sulfuric Gas
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgg.name=§5§lSulfuric Gas
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgg.desc=Another distillate for your gas turbine you can make out of oil is sulfuric gas with a burn value of 25,000 EU per cell.

# Quest: Refinery Gas
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgw.name=§5§lRefinery Gas
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgw.desc=Refine your gas in a chemical reactor with Hydrogen gas to give it a better burn value of 160,000 EU. It used to be the least useful fraction of oil, but it's now possible to distill it into large amounts of Ethylene if you steam-crack the Refinery Gas beforehand.%n%nThis early, you will have to use a Chemical Reactor to crack it, but later on there's a dedicated multiblock for this purpose, the Oil Cracker. For best Ethylene results, you should severely steam-crack it, and you will get lots of Methane as well.

# Quest: Methane
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAChA.name=§5§lMethane
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAChA.desc=Distilling some "refinery gases" gives you some methane gas. There are many more (and probably better) ways to get methane.%n%nYou will need this in later tiers, for PTFE as an example.

# Quest: Electrotine Battery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAChg.name=§5§lElectrotine Battery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAChg.desc=The electrotine battery is exclusively used in project red machines and the jetpack. Electrotine is made by mixing redstone and electrum dust in a mixer, or mined from the Nether.

# Quest: Basic Arc Furnace
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAClg.name=§5§lBasic Arc Furnace
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAClg.desc=The arc furnace is an alternative to macerating stuff back into dusts and for making wrought iron, annealed copper, and glass (in MV). You get ingots, and sometimes different materials back from recycling than with a macerator. You also have all 4 slots at LV. The recipes use oxygen and 3A of power.%n%nJust ignore the plasma one.%n%nAnd no, you can't just send 1A of MV. That will blow it up.

# Quest: Faster Steel Production
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAClw.name=§5§lFaster Steel Production
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAClw.desc=A faster alternative to steel production is to use the arc furnace and smelt iron ingots (or dust) into wrought iron ingots. Then macerate them to dust and smelt them very fast in the EBF to steel.%n%nOf course, you'll need enough oxygen to do so.

# Quest: LV Extruder
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACoQ.name=§5§lLV Extruder
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACoQ.desc=The extruder is not very useful in LV. But it will extrude your next tier of boat, make rubber sheets more efficiently, get you extra fluid cells, or make §osome§r Tinkers Construct tool parts.

# Quest: Process Some Certus Quartz
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzA.name=§5§lProcess Some Certus Quartz
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzA.desc=For the emitter and the sensor you'll need to get some certus quartz.

# Quest: Good Circuits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzQ.name=§5§lGood Circuits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzQ.desc=Good circuits are an improvement on basic circuits. They're an MV-tier circuit, which is a component of all MV gregtech machines.%n%nTo open MV, you still need to make an EBF and do the Aluminium quest if you haven't already, since §oeverything§r needs aluminium.%n%nThis quest also opens the Project Red quests - one of the early automation options.

# Quest: Dust to Crystals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAw.name=§5§lDust to Crystals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAw.desc=Use the autoclave to crystallize your dust. You can also make Raw Carbon Fibre out of Carbon Dust, and do other things.

# Quest: Basic Circuit Assembler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADGw.name=§5§lBasic Circuit Assembler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADGw.desc=Advanced (HV) circuits require an LV circuit assembling machine. Basic (LV) and Good (MV) ones can also be made much more efficiently with this machine.%n%nHowever, all circuit assemblers need higher tier circuits than the other machines of their tier. This means you have to use MV circuits instead of the LV ones you've been using until now. I know you want it, so make it already!

# Quest: Gallium Arsenide Crystal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADRA.name=§5§lGallium Arsenide Crystal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADRA.desc=The diode requires gallium arsenide, and you may be wondering how to get gallium or arsenic this early in the game.%n%nSphalerite and zinc are the primary sources of gallium at this tier.%n%nYou can find sphalerite in sulfur veins at Y 5-20, and the small zinc ores in the Overworld or the Nether at Y 80-210. You won't find much on the Overworld because of obvious reasons. To get additional zinc crushed ore drops, use a Tinker's Construct tool with the Luck (Fortune) enchant on it, probably the best use for all that lapis you got while looking for calcite. Or use a miner, if you don't mind how slow it is.%n%n- Sphalerite can be electrolyzed for a small chance of a gallium dust. Better put in a lot or you might get unlucky.%n- Zinc crushed ore can be washed and then thermal centrifuged or forge hammered and then centrifuged. But you don't always get the crushed ore as a drop, the impure dust doesn't give gallium.%n%nYou can get arsenic from realgar small ores in the Nether at Y 15-85. Centrifuge the dusts in a centrifuge.%n%nOther sources are Tinker's Construct cobalt ore in the nether and cobaltite ore in the Twilight Forest. You can use your EBF for that. You also need to level up your pickaxe to ardite or make an Ironwood Pickaxe or LV Miner to harvest cobalt ore.%n%nAnother way to get gallium and arsenic is with XP buckets in a crafting grid if you're really desperate.%n%nWith your EBF you can combine these two dusts to make a Gallium Arsenide Crystal.

# Quest: Handle Tiny Piles Like a K1ng
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADRw.name=§5§6§l§5§lHandle Tiny Piles Like a K1ng
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADRw.desc=Don't you hate having to manually compress all those tiny piles? Well, let me show you how to automate that. A combination of type filter, chest buffer (or super buffer in HV) and packager frees you from that annoying task. The chestbuffer can hold up to 9 stacks of tiny piles and the super buffer can hold 256 stacks of tiny dusts, which is more than enough. You can set its mode with a screwdriver on the output side. Set it to 9 to export 9 tiny piles at a time and let the packager compress these into regular dusts.%n%nSuper buffers can be lag sources, so be careful to keep them as empty as possible. If you're using a multiblock packager, be sure to change the buffer from Stocking mode to Transfer Size mode.

# Quest: Butane and Propane
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADSA.name=§5§lButane and Propane
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADSA.desc=You can crack and distill a lot of different fluids out of your already distilled products, such as Butane, Butene, Butadiene, Benzene, Ethane, Ethylene, Helium, Hydrogen, Methane, Octane, Propane, Propene, Toluene, and even more Light Fuel, Heavy Fuel, or Naphtha. You can then crack them down even further too sometimes. Many of these are only used for power. Go check out the spreadsheet for more details than this quest can encompass.%n%nFor now, get some Butane and Propane.

# Quest: Sifting Machine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADZQ.name=§5§lSifting Machine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADZQ.desc=Do you need flawless or exquisite diamonds, emeralds, rubies or other gems? Or, interested in getting more flint, coal, or whatnot out of your ore? Well then it's time for you to make a Sifting Machine.%n%nYou can find small Zinc ores (look in NEI) or you can search the Nether for Sphalerite.%n%nThe Sifter only takes Purified ores, but you can get these easily by throwing Crushed ores into a Cauldron with water.%n%n[note]Note that you need Polyethylene to make this machine![/note]

# Quest: GT Tanks, the LV Version
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADew.name=§5§lGT Tanks, the LV Version
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADew.desc=The next version of GT tanks stores 64,000L in a tank. It actually requires a pump this time, so it's a little expensive. Consider staying with your ULV ones if you only need basic I/O.

# Quest: GT MV Tank...Already?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADfA.name=§5§lGT MV Tank...Already?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADfA.desc=These store 128,000L. The dark steel plates and LV pump make it a little annoying to make, since it needs an EBF.

# Quest: Simple Ore Washer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADgg.name=§5§lSimple Ore Washer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADgg.desc=Too lazy to make an ore washer, yet bored with your non-automatable cauldron? Then the simple washer is the machine for you! It works much faster than a normal ore washer. Of course, you don't get any byproducts, but who cares!%n%nThere are simple washers for every tier up to UV, but the speed doesn't increase much past the HV version.

# Quest: Auto Mining
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADog.name=§5§lAuto Mining
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADog.desc=Automatic mining in LV tier? Wow! This nifty machine will collect ores for you, which can be helpful especially in the Nether, as it won't anger pigmen.%n%nPlace up to two stacks of mining pipes in the right slots. Each pipe can go 1 block, and allow the miner to dig 1 block further. If you're above Y64, you may need to pipe more in.%n%nThis machine only needs 8 EU/t to work, so LV batteries in a batbuff work ok if you don't want to make another generator.%n%nThe miner searches for ores in a 17x17 block work area (adjustable with a screwdriver), and comes with a level 1 fortune bonus! Great for gathering additional small ores!%n%nDon't forget to cover it up! These are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on all sides. And set a waypoint with JourneyMap so you don't forget where you placed it if you place it far away! You'll need to chunkload the miner if you want it to keep working when you're not there.

# Quest: Automated Sticky Resin Farmer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADqg.name=§5§6§l§5§lAutomated Sticky Resin Farmer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADqg.desc=If you're tired of crafting tons of tree taps, how about a machine that uses power but never breaks? Let's craft an electric tree tap!%n%n(If you're looking for better ways to get Sticky Resin, you might want to consider the Stickreed crop from IC2 crops. To get it, plant Sugarcanes on Crops on an X formation, with spaces between them, and then put 2 Crops on each empty slot. For more information, check the crop quests.

# Quest: Automated Farmer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADqw.name=§6§l§d§5§lAutomated Farmer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADqw.desc=Your hoe must be getting worn out by now. Why not craft an electric one which never breaks?

# Quest: Vroooooom...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADwg.name=§5§lVroooooom...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADwg.desc=Tired of standing around to collect all the drops and XP from your diamond spikes?%n%nMake yourself a vacuum hopper to suck up all the drops and XP. Feed the XP into a tank to store it.

# Quest: Brewing, the Industrial Way
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE-Q.name=§5§lBrewing, the Industrial Way
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE-Q.desc=If you want brews or alcohol, I recommend you to build one of these. You might have noticed that you cannot build a brewing stand without Thaumcraft. But fear not, you can still find them in secret rooms on the first floor of some roguelike dungeons or ur-ghast towers. Better get searching...

# Quest: Ferment Your Brew!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE-g.name=§5§lFerment Your Brew!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE-g.desc=What's better than lame brews? Alcoholic brews! Get one of these to make beer, rum or even vodka.

# Quest: Be Sure to Get Your Armpits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECw.name=§5§lBe Sure to Get Your Armpits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECw.desc=Want to use all that delicious XP to raise your levels? Move the tank with XP above you and attach this convenient shower head to take the XP from the tank.%n%nThis thing can be laggy, so be careful about letting too many xp orbs out of the tank. Apply a redstone signal to turn it off.

# Quest: Lubricant
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEPA.name=§5§lLubricant
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEPA.desc=Using lubricant instead of water or distilled water in your cutting machines will increase their speed.%n%nYou can make lubricant out of oil, seed oil, fish oil or creosote in a distillery (or distillation tower later on). If you're able to craft a brewery you can use talc or soapstone to get much more lubricant each cycle.%n%nLube cells are required to make low tier energy hatches, so stockpile a few cells and use the rest to make your cutting machine faster.

# Quest: Time to Dry Out the Nether
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQg.name=§5§lTime to Dry Out the Nether
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQg.desc=Pumps can do more than pump oil and water. You can go to the nether and pump lava from the huge lava lakes too.%n%nOnce you reach HV, lava can be centrifuged for Silicon Dioxide, Magnesia, Quicklime, Gold, Sapphire, and Tantalite. You can get Silicon, Magnesium, Calcium, Gold, Aluminium, Manganese, Tantalum, and Oxygen out of them.%n%nThis is a good use for your LV pumps once you upgrade to MV pumps for oil. If you get into Thaumcraft or Blood Magic, there are ways to produce lava with magic unlimitedly and easily too.%n%n[note]You'll want either ULV tanks and cells, or BC tanks and a dolly to transport your lava.[/note]

# Quest: Diamond Tanks... Ooo, Shiny
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQw.name=§5§lDiamond Tanks... Ooo, Shiny
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQw.desc=After you build a cutting machine you can make some diamond plates for your new 64,000L single block tank.

# Quest: Ardite and Cobalt
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEaw.name=§5§lArdite and Cobalt
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEaw.desc=If you have some time you can look for cobalt and ardite in the Nether.%n%nYou've heard rumors of a special wood only found in another land, a forest of Twilight, that can make tools strong enough to mine them.%n%nRemember, you need an electric blast furnace to process these materials before you can make tools with them.

# Quest: LV Advanced Steam Boiler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEbg.name=§5§lLV Advanced Steam Boiler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEbg.desc=The LV GT++ Steam Boiler is the next machine you can build to produce steam more efficiently than with the High Pressure Boiler. It won't use fuel up unless it starts to run low on steam, so it's very efficient.

# Quest: Lossless LV Cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcA.name=§5§lLossless LV Cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcA.desc=How about lossless 32 EU cables? Redstone alloy is a superconductor and will transfer your energy without any loss.%n%nRedstone Alloy is a new alloy which requires an EBF. Mix redstone, silicon and coal by hand, or in the mixer for a better result.%n%n[note]Remember not to mix it up with Red Alloy, that's the ULV one.[/note]

# Quest: A New Alloy - Magnalium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEfQ.name=§5§lA New Alloy - Magnalium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEfQ.desc=Wondering why you need magnalium now? It's not for GT machines but for a material update for your crossbow.%n%nYou already made some Aluminium dust before. Getting Aluminium will become easier once you get an EBF or MV electrolyzer.%nIf you can't find any aluminium, search for chests in the Twilight Forest or kill a few monsters. %n%nCombine Aluminium and Magnesium in your alloy smelter to get Magnalium.

# Quest: Basic Fluid Solidifier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgw.name=§5§lBasic Fluid Solidifier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgw.desc=To get your molten fluids back to a solid state you need a fluid solidifier. This is handy for processing molten rubber directly from the chemical reactor. It's used for crossbow bolts as well.%n%nKeep in mind that GT fluids are different from Tinker's Construct. You will mainly work with GT fluids going forward.

# Quest: Empty Cells
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEiA.name=§5§lEmpty Cells
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEiA.desc=With your plate bender you're able to make empty cells. The circuit needs to be configured to 12 otherwise you will make foils. Once you have an LV Extruder, you can make cells directly from ingots.

# Quest: Quartzite Veins
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEjg.name=§5§lQuartzite Veins
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEjg.desc=The Nether is full of different kinds of quartz. Go and find a quartzite vein. They're located between Y 80-120. It might be hard to find one, because that area is usually air, you'll just have to keep looking.

# Quest: Lithium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEjw.name=§5§lLithium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEjw.desc=Lithium can be washed out of Lepidolite Ore or centrifuged out of either Lepidolite Ore or Spodumene Ore. At MV you can electrolyze clay dust for it. Look for canyons to find hardened clay and macerate it for dust.

# Quest: Sodium

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAElA.desc=It's even faster and cheaper to make annealed copper in the arc furnace than in the electric blast furnace. Annealed copper is a very good material for cables in MV. It only loses 1 EU per block.

# Quest: Personal Chunkloading
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF-A.name=§5§lPersonal Chunkloading
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF-A.desc=Let's craft a personal chunkloader. It will load a 3x3 chunk area. You need ender fragments, ender pearls, or coins to power the chunkloader.%n%nPersonal anchors can be powered with ender fragments for 1h, ender pearls for 4 hours, and a varying amount depending on the coin used.%n%nPersonal Anchors§r are loaded once the owner visits, and stays loaded while the player is logged in.%n%nPassive Anchors§r are loaded once the owner visits, and stays loaded until the server resets.%n%nWorld Anchors§r are always loaded, even after a server reset.

# Quest: Chemical Bath
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF2w.name=§5§lChemical Bath
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF2w.desc=Wait, what? You want more byproducts from your ores? A cheaper way to make paper? Well, the chemical bath is perfect for you!%n%nYou'll have to provide liquids like mercury to extract different products like nickel, silver, copper, and platinum (only as PMP) from ores.%n%nFor paper you'll only need some water and wood pulp. Maybe you'll find more uses for it!

# Quest: Biomes Everywhere, But Not the One You Want?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF5g.name=§5§lBiomes Everywhere, But Not the One You Want?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF5g.desc=Tired of searching all over the map for that Bamboo Forest or Tropical Rainforest? Desperate for clay dust and need to find a Canyon or Mesa biome? Nature's compass will lead you to the biome you're looking for, if it's within its range.%n%nThe compass menu has the following functionality:%n* When Sorted By: Name, you can filter the list by name or its parts. The search is case-insensitive.%n* You can search by keys and their combinations. For instance, name: bamboo, climate: warm, bh: -1.8, tag: forest.%nAll available keys are:%nname,%nclimate [hellish, hot, warm, normal, cold, icy],%nbaseheight | bh (float, can be negative),%nheightvariation | hv (float),%nrainfall | rain (float),%ntemperature | temp (float),%nhumidity [damp, normal, arid],%ntags.%n%nSome things to keep in mind:%n* Biomes from other dimensions show up on the list, don't bother searching for those unless you're in that dimension.%n* In general, the full list has biomes that are not generated by Realistic World Generator, like Sunflower Plains.%n* Radius 10000 means it couldn't find the biome. In this case after the initial search, its menu will show only the biomes in the 10k radius. Use Shift+RMB to see the whole list again.%n* You can try again at a different location - the range is 10k from your current position.%n* Artificially created biomes count, so remove them if you want to find a natural one.%n* There's lots of different 'versions' of biomes under the same category, so if you want a tropical one for tropical bees, there are actually a bunch of places you can get it.%n* For those who don't mind the freeze when searching, the radius can be changed in a config. The HUD position can also be changed in the config.

# Quest: Portable Tanks Too Small?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF7w.name=§5§lPortable Tanks Too Small?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF7w.desc=How about large steel fluid cells instead? Each holds 8000L, and they can stack to 64. Unfortunately, you have to load and unload them using a machine's interface - like ULV tanks for example - but hey, 512 buckets in a single slot is pretty good!%n%nYou cannot use these cells directly in the world, like BC tanks, or to dump the fluid on the ground.

# Quest: Diamond Spikes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFBQ.name=§5§lDiamond Spikes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFBQ.desc=Diamond Spikes damages mobs (or you!) that touch any side of it other than the bottom. With 7 attack damage, the Spike does as much damage as a Diamond Sword. Mobs will not walk around the block, but will try to walk over it as if it were a regular solid block. Most explosions won't destroy the Spike because it has a very high blast resistance.%n%nThese can also be enchanted with all the enchantments a regular diamond sword would receive. This includes Looting and Sharpness, which function exactly as it does on a sword. Interestingly, mobs killed by the Diamond Spike will return experience as if killed by the player.%n%nThere are weaker versions, but who wants that? If you happen to want the last hit, you might want the wooden ones though.

# Quest: §§Black and Decker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGAQ.name=§§§5§lBlack and Decker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGAQ.desc=Tired of having to replace tools all the time because they constantly break? Now that Steel is available, it's time to make some electric versions of the Screwdriver and Wrench! Charge them up like Batteries, and they'll last much longer than the non-electric versions of these tools.%n%nYou can use Lithium Batteries, or if you're on a budget, Cadmium or Sodium Batteries instead. This does reduce their energy capacity though. Later on, Vibrant Alloy will make excellent tools with great durability. There are, however, a multitude of other great materials that you may have access to, so take a look around in NEI and decide for yourself.%n%nThere are also MV and HV versions, though they require that you can process Aluminium or Stainless Steel, respectively.

# Quest: Magnesium Source
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBA.name=§5§lMagnesium Source
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBA.desc=Magnesite, the source of Magnesium can be found in the Twilight Forest at Y 10-40. Fullers Earth can be found on the Overworld at Y 50-70.

# Quest: Node Upgrades
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGPw.name=§5§lNode Upgrades
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGPw.desc=Nodes can take many upgrades. For now, try building a World Interaction Upgrade. With it, you can set up simple autocrafting.%n%nPut a WIU in a transfer node attached to a crafting table. On the other side of the table, the 3x3 area is now treated as a crafting grid. Place items in inventories on the other side and if they make a valid recipe, the WIU will craft it. To speed it up, you will need to wait until HV for stainless steel.%n%nAlso, if you place a node on a block of cobble that has lava and water next to it, and a WIU in it, it will produce cobble for you automatically. Use upgrades to get more at a time and faster.%n%n[warn]The WIU can NOT be used for infinite water in GTNH.[/warn]

# Quest: Oilsand, or How You Get Heavy Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG_w.name=§5§lOilsand, or How You Get Heavy Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG_w.desc=Oilsand is another way to get heavy oil. Maybe you got lucky and found some in a mountainous biome. With your centrifuge you're able to get heavy oil and sand out of the ore. The veins can be found between Y 50-80.%n%nSadly, you can't use heavy oil until MV, so just stick them in a barrel or something until then.%n%n[note]Until MV it can only be used for lubricant and burning in a semifluid generator.[/note]

# Quest: Enderman Smelterman
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHSQ.name=§5§lEnderman Smelterman
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHSQ.desc=Need enderpearls? Getting them by killing endermen can be dangerous. Instead of doing that, put an enderman into a smeltery with hot fluids and use a gem cast to get guaranteed pearls.%n%nThe higher the hit points, the longer they'll last, so the more pearls you get. If you can find a regenerating enderman, or an enderman spawner, you'll have all the pearls you would ever want. Later on with EnderIO you can even create your own powered spawner to make endermen on-demand. Or just place it in the End and move the mobs inside.%n%nUse a nametag on a regenerating enderman to make sure he doesn't despawn. You'll want to keep him from seeing the sky or else he'll teleport away.%n%nIf you haven't found a regen enderman yet, you can buy enderman spawn eggs to put into your smeltery with coins. Maybe you'll get lucky and get a regenerating one.

# Quest: Electric Furnace
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHXw.name=§5§lElectric Furnace
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHXw.desc=It's, like, faster than a normal one I guess? But uses power.

# Quest: Craftsman Used to Mean Quality
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHdw.name=§5§lCraftsman Used to Mean Quality
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHdw.desc=Now that you have an EBF you can make vanadiumsteel GT tools. With 192k durability they'll last you a long time.

# Quest: Too Much Fluid??
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHfg.name=§5§lToo Much Fluid??
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHfg.desc=Impossible! If you really think you have so much fluid that you want to just get rid of it, make a fluid trashcan. You can route as much excess creosote or whatever into it that you want.

# Quest: Automated Crafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIXg.name=§5§lAutomated Crafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIXg.desc=The Auto Workbench is a simple automated crafting system. You place ghost items in the grid to create the recipe, and place components in the inventory. They will slowly be converted into the crafted item. While not fast and can only do 1 recipe each, it does support automation - only items acceptable to the recipe are allowed in the inventory. It does not use power.

# Quest: Choices, Choices
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIXw.name=§5§lChoices, Choices
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIXw.desc=Need a map on fuel choices? Well, we don't have that, but we have suggestions. You can use Steam up to IV, but beyond MV it gets pretty painful.%n%nIn LV you can start refining oil for either Light Fuel for a Combustion Generator or Refinery Gas for a Gas Turbine. Or you can use Creosote in a Semi-Fluid Generator.%n%nOnce you hit MV, you can switch from Steam to renewable Benzene (Gas) from your logs. Other renewable alternatives are Fish Oil or Seed Oil based bio diesel (combustion). Seed Oil can be sourced from Pam's peanuts, IC2 Rape crop or Forestry tree nuts.%n%nAt MV you can also upgrade your Light Fuel with Heavy Fuel to get Diesel. When you reach HV turn diesel or bio diesel into Cetane Boosted Diesel. In EV, you can make High Octane Gasoline (HOG), but it's complex, and you'll need to rejigger your whole oil distillation setup, since it uses different fluids than Cetane does.%n%nEV introduces the Large Gas Turbine, Large Steam Turbine, Large HP Steam Turbine, and Large Combustion Engine, which are more efficient versions of the earlier ones. The first 3 require turbines.%n%nYou can also make Nukes, or Wind and Water Kinetics.%n%nFor low-power operations, or dedicated players willing to set up autocrafting, you can begin using Solar Panels at MV.

# Quest: Fertilized Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJWQ.name=§5§lFertilized Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJWQ.desc=With a Chemical Reactor, you can make Fertilized Earth. It ticks faster than normal farmland, so crops will mature much faster. As a bonus, it can be tilled away from water and doesn't get damaged when you fall on it.%n%nIt does allow IC2 crops to be placed on them, but will not accelerate the crops.

# Quest: Where Does it All Go?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJYw.name=§5§lWhere Does it All Go?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJYw.desc=The time may come when you finally decide you have enough of a fluid. This overflow cover lets you tune how full a tank can get. You can put it on a smaller tank leading to a bigger tank, and when the bigger tank gets full, the fluid will backup into the smaller tank. Once the fluid level in the smaller tank exceeds the setting on the cover, it will start voiding fluid.%n%nHandy for an oxygen centrifuge setup when you don't want to stop from excess nitrogen.

# Quest: Long Distance Fluid Pipeline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJjA.name=§5§lLong Distance Fluid Pipeline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJjA.desc=Wouldn't it be great if you could transport your oil from a far away oil spout or oil field by pipes to your base?%n%nThis is not a problem anymore. Connect your setup on the start and end point with a Long Distance Fluid Pipeline block. In between use the associated pipe blocks - the total distance between endpoints must be more than 64 blocks apart (4 or more chunks). There can only be one start and end point per pipeline.%n%nTo actually connect it, you need to align the start LDFP block such that the arrows are facing inwards, and the opposite side of it has a LDFPP block. Put a pump on the side of the block that has the arrows and set to import. It will now attempt to import fluid to the endpoint LDFP. §2This will go as fast as you can put fluid into it.§r%n%nDo the opposite on the far side, except you don't need a pump.%n%nNow you only need to chunkload the start and end points and the fluid will be "teleported" to you.%n%nOf course, later on you'll probably use ender tanks to §oactually§r teleport the fluid, especially from other dims.%n%nThis setup is lag-free in the pipe blocks, so it's useful in your base as well if you want to reduce lag.

# Quest: Chlorine, Your New Best Friend
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiQ.name=§5§lChlorine, Your New Best Friend
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiQ.desc=Chlorine is a fluid that is used in significant quantities throughout the game, so you might as well get used to collecting it now.%n%nYou can electrolyze Salt, Rock Salt, Sodalite (finally a use!), or Salt Water for it. Since you'll need so much, you may wish to consider using your first Super Tank to hold it all.

# Quest: Faster Steam Transportation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIQ.name=§5§lFaster Steam Transportation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIQ.desc=Do you think that steam fluid transport is far too slow? Your LV pumps got you down, doing only 640L/s? Then it's time to make the 32 times faster LV steam valves!%n%nThey only work with steam and are just as fast as the valve on a Railcraft tank (if you put it on the bottom side).%n%nThere are also MV, HV, EV, and IV versions.

# Quest: Long Distance Item Pipeline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIg.name=§5§lLong Distance Item Pipeline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIg.desc=Wouldn't it be great if you could transport ores from a far away ore vein by pipes to your base?%n%nThis is not a problem anymore. Connect your setup on the start and end point with a Long Distance Item Pipeline block. In between use the associated pipe blocks - the total distance between endpoints must be more than 64 blocks apart (4 or more chunks). There can only be one start and end point per pipeline.%n%nTo actually connect it, you need to align the start LDIP block such that the arrows are facing inwards, and the opposite side of it has a LDIPP block. Put a conveyor on the side of the block that has the arrows and set to import. It will now attempt to import stuff to the endpoint LDIP. This will go as fast as you can put items into it.§r%n%nDo the opposite on the far side, except you don't need a conveyor.%n%nNow you only need to chunkload the start and end points and the items will be "teleported" to you.%n%nOf course, later on you'll probably use ender chests to §oactually§r teleport the ore, especially from other dims.%n%nThis setup is lag-free in the pipe blocks, so it's useful in your base as well if you want to reduce lag.

# Quest: Prison Gangs are Obsolete
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLQ.name=§5§lPrison Gangs are Obsolete
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLQ.desc=Want lots of cobble, stone, or obsidian? This is the machine for you!%n%nCobble: Water and lava on 2 of the sides.%nStone: Water on a side, lava on top.%nObsidian: Either of the above, and redstone in the machine.%n%nYou of course need to power it. If you don't want to spend power on cobble, do it the ExU way with the WIU.%n%nYou need to toggle the ghost circuit to circuit 1 to get obsidian.

# Quest: Magnets != Magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALSw.name=§5§lMagnets != Magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALSw.desc=Tired of running after ore or other blocks? Use a magnet! It has a limited range, but who cares? Just remember to turn it on.%n%nIn HV you can craft it into the better one, if you still need a magnet by then.

# Quest: Cobalt and Arsenic from Cobaltite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALYg.name=§d§0§5§lCobalt and Arsenic from Cobaltite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALYg.desc=Can't find any Cobalt in the Nether? Too lazy to bother finding some Ironwood in the Twilight Forest, even though it's super duper easy?%n%nYou can make it with your EBF now using Cobaltite Ore from the Twilight Forest and Oxygen to get Cobalt. It's a little complicated, but you also get arsenic out of it.%n%nYou can also just electrolyze it out in MV, which is what you §oshould§r be doing instead of this, but assuming you actually need it this method has higher yields (at the cost of carbon of course).

# Quest: Damascus Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALYw.name=§5§lDamascus Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALYw.desc=Damascus Steel is one of the hardest materials you can get, at your current tier. It's time to craft a stack of Damascus Steel.%n%nYou can't get it through the Mixer yet, but there is a crafting recipe.

# Quest: Aluminium Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALow.name=§5§6§l§5§lAluminium Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALow.desc=If you make some Double Aluminium Plates, you can make a new 96,000L single block tank.

# Quest: Mica Ore
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALpw.name=§5§lMica Ore
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALpw.desc=Mica is a very rare but useful ore. You need it in order to craft your coils for the Electric Blast Furnace. Only for cupronickel coils there is a replacement recipe. If you have no luck in finding this vein yet try to look for it with a Prospector once you get them.

# Quest: Handle Resources Like a Bo$$ #2
betterquesting.quest.JRrD8MoLRuCHCD-fFpeNvQ.name=§5§6§l§5§lHandle Resources Like a Bo$$ #2
betterquesting.quest.JRrD8MoLRuCHCD-fFpeNvQ.desc=A feat of human engineering at your disposal!%n%nThis machine allows you to filter 9 items, and will only output set batches. This allows you to automate processes such as electrolyzing that require different amounts of inputs that may clog the system otherwise.%n%n[note]This will be particularly useful in MV once you unlock more electrolysis recipes![/note]

# Quest: Keeping things organized
betterquesting.quest.b47jlBoHTFGGB3j7nq60Zw.name=§5§lKeeping things organized
betterquesting.quest.b47jlBoHTFGGB3j7nq60Zw.desc=Are you tired of storing Shapes and/or Molds near your Extruders and Solidifiers instead of inside them? Today must be your lucky day, because these item holders let you do exactly that!%n%nThey allow your machines to hold a small number of extra items, though each slot can only store one item at a time. There are three versions of this cover, each offering a different amount of storage:%n%nBasic Item Holder: 9 slots%nGood Item Holder: 12 slots%nAdvanced Item Holder: 15 slots%n%n[note]If that's still not enough space and you are already using the highest tier, you can simply attach multiple holders to your machine of choice.[/note]

# Quest: Refined Firestone
betterquesting.quest.njE33db1TxaiJhEBA16E4A.name=§5§lRefined Firestone§5
betterquesting.quest.njE33db1TxaiJhEBA16E4A.desc=Cut Firestone is the basic shape for producing Refined Firestone.%nUse a Diamond Lens or Flint Lens for cutting.%nIt is then fired with lava in the EBF.%n%nLastly it is thrown into lava and charged by absorbing lava blocks around it.%nIt needs 5000 lava blocks to be fully charged, so a large lava lake is required, preferably in the Nether.%n%n[note]If the firestone breaks, it can be repaired with lava in the EBF and recharged.[/note]

# Quest: Precision Laser Engraver
betterquesting.quest.vV8Pw_lTTSiMmWOLqkyIWg.name=§5§lPrecision Laser Engraver
betterquesting.quest.vV8Pw_lTTSiMmWOLqkyIWg.desc=The Precision Laser Engraver does not have many functions in LV, but is needed to create Cut Firestone which can later be filled with lava.


## Quest Line: Tier 2 - MV
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABA.name=Tier 2 - MV
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABA.desc=Your second voltage tier. Don't mix different voltage levels, or you'll have a fancy new crater. Start thinking about how to expand your base.%n%nBTW, for OCing purposes, this counts as tier 2, ULV doesn't count.

# Quest: Electrolyzing All the Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAfg.name=§6§lElectrolyzing All the Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAfg.desc=Collected a lot of dusts you can't do anything with since you started with macerating, washing and centrifuging ores? It's finally time to get all the useful materials out of them.%n%nThis machine is §overy §o§rimportant for your MV progression. If you find a biome with tons of Stained or Hardened Clay, you can process it here, plus some other machines, into Sodium, Lithium, Silicon, Aluminium and Oxygen!

# Quest: IO, IO, It's Off to EnderIO We Go
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgA.name=§6§lIO, IO, It's Off to EnderIO We Go
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgA.desc=You've probably used EnderIO before. It's quite useful for a lot of things. But the recipes are different and it's not as useful for some things like ore processing. Let's go through what it has to offer. Note that the other half is in HV.

# Quest: Machine Chassis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgQ.name=§6§lMachine Chassis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgQ.desc=All EnderIO machines still require the basic chassis, and it's almost the same recipe as before; Except that you need plates instead of ingots. But that shouldn't be a problem at all...

# Quest: Portable Tanks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgg.name=§6§lPortable Tanks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgg.desc=Until now, you had to use buildcraft tanks with dollies to carry liquids around. Which can be a pain with all that slowness. These portable tanks from EnderIO are able to push and pull liquids by themselves, as they have a built-in pump which is powered by some magic energy source. How convenient.%n%nThe pressurized versions are twice as large.%n%n[note]Just be careful, because it will eat water cells instead of returning them.[/note]

# Quest: Simple RF power: Solid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgw.name=§6§lSimple RF power: Solid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgw.desc=By simply burning coal as fuel, this machine produces RF power. Enough for a basic machine setup. This machine will also accept compressed and multiple-compressed blocks. Want to burn something for 250+ days? Also, with double or octadic capacitors the output will increase and efficiency will improve.%n%nGT wiring can convert EU to RF, but not the other way around. Note that with the eNet changes a GT wire network will need at least one GT energy consumer - a machine hull of the matching voltage will work.%n%nEnder IO machines and GT cables and Wires can be left safely out in the rain.%n%nIt might be useful for Genetics machines since they consume excessive power when attached to GT wiring - Forestry and EnderIO machines work fine (except for the Thermionic Fabricator). Or use a Capacitor Bank.

# Quest: Simple RF Power: Liquids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhA.name=§6§lSimple RF Power: Liquids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhA.desc=This generator requires both water as coolant, and a burnable liquid as fuel. The amount of power it produces depends on the type of liquid used.%n%nFuel           Burn Time (ticks/mb)    Power Output (RF/tick)    Power Output (RF/mb)%nOil                5                          30                               150%nHootch          6                          60                               360%nEthanol        15                          40                               600%nFire Water    15                          80                              1200%nDiesel/Fuel   25                          60                              1500%n%n[note]Rocket Fuel is disabled.[/note]

# Quest: Conduits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhg.name=§6§lConduits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhg.desc=Probably the most awesome way to transport just about anything in multiple different ways. Get some conduits of each type. Higher tiers of each (except item) exist.%n%n[note]There's also ME conduits for when you can do that.[/note]

# Quest: Yet Another Wrench
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhw.name=§6§lYet Another Wrench
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhw.desc=The Yeta Wrench is more than just a regular wrench. While holding it, you are able to switch between conduit types, eventually allowing you to remove one specific conduit type from a bundle of many. Ctrl-Mousewheel will switch modes, also shift-left-click allows you to open the configuration interface even if you don't have access to that side of the conduit.

# Quest: Improving Conduits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAiA.name=§6§lImproving Conduits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAiA.desc=Conduits on their own are pretty awesome, but you can do better. By using filters and speed upgrades, you gain even more control over what they do and how fast they work.%n%n[note]PS: You can't make all of these right now.[/note]

# Quest: Making Things Pretty
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAiQ.name=§6§lMaking Things Pretty
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAiQ.desc=While conduits on their own are already awesome, you can also hide them if you want. There are 2 types of facades, basic and hardened. While basic ones are simple and easy, the reinforced ones are able to withstand explosions and mining with tools. You have to use your Yeta Wrench to remove it.%n%nYou'll have to paint your facades in the Painting Machine first - place the block you want them to look like where the paintbrush is, and the facade on the left. Of course, the Painting Machine needs to be powered.

# Quest: Come to the Dark Side...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAig.name=§5§6§lCome to the Dark Side...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAig.desc=...we have cookies.

# Quest: Brewing Liquids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjg.name=§6§lBrewing Liquids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjg.desc=This machine is not only capable of brewing more powerful burnable liquids, it can also be used to brew nutrient distillation, which might have further usage soon™.%n%nNote that you get different ratios depending on what item you use for recipes that allow alternates. Use what you like.

# Quest: Smelting All-Joy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjw.name=§6§lSmelting All-Joy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjw.desc=This combination smelter allows you to produce fused quartz and quite clear glass of all variants.%n%nIt does §onot§r alloy you to make the EIO alloys though, you'll need a mixer and (probably) EBF for that.

# Quest: Ore Processing, Kind Of...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAkQ.name=§6§lOre Processing, Kind Of...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAkQ.desc=The endless war between macerators and SAG mills rages on eternally, so why does it matter which one you choose?%n%nHV Macerators are still required for the final byproducts on many ore chains, but a SAG mill still shines through with upgraded grinding heads! SAG mills are perfect machine for getting the most from your ores without using bees and crops. You can get bonus outputs with tungsten grinding heads, but that doesn't mean you can dupe materials (like ingots) with it. Plus for many of them you'll get the final output directly without any need for further processing. Handy for processing Redstone to get Chrome!%n%nIt's great for lead, copper, tin, silver, nickel, redstone, ruby, lapis, certus quartz, and malachite ores. Other ores will give you better outputs as well if you use a good enough head.%n%nEven coal, charcoal, bones, wheat, ender pearls, and charcoal non-ores will give bonus outputs.%n%nThat said, the GT ones are still way faster later on.

# Quest: Tasty...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlA.name=§6§lTasty...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlA.desc=Yeah, that is... Well... You are sure it will have a usage for something... some day... eventually... maybe...

# Quest: Fire Water
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlQ.name=§6§lFire Water
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlQ.desc=Too bad, you can't drink it. When used in the Combustion Generator, it will produce 80 RF/t.

# Quest: Hootch
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlg.name=§6§lHootch
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlg.desc=The lowest tier of renewable, burnable fluid. Generates 60 RF/t, but can be automated for "green" infinite power.

# Quest: Simple Item Transfer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmQ.name=§6§lSimple Item Transfer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmQ.desc=Translocators can only transfer items over a distance of 1 block. But they're quite cheap, and a good solution to building compact machine setups. They include a free simple item filter which can be enabled on the input or output side. And they support multiple inputs and outputs! Glowstone will make it transfer faster - try investigating other upgrades.

# Quest: Simple Fluid Transfer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmg.name=§6§lSimple Fluid Transfer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmg.desc=Just like the item translocators, the fluid ones transfer... fluids. Same restrictions apply, 1 block distance. These can also be upgraded.

# Quest: A New Alloy, Soularium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAApg.name=§6§lA New Alloy, Soularium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAApg.desc=There are some... "Darker" uses for machines. Stuff that might be considered "magic". Anyway, for that you need a new alloy: Soularium.

# Quest: A Soul Vessel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAqA.name=§6§lA Soul Vessel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAqA.desc=The Soul Vial is used later in HV Ender IO machines. For now though you may find it convenient to deal with....troublesome mobs. The Soul Vial is reusable. Just right-click any living entity to steal its soul. Right-click again to release it in the environment.%n%nThe possibilities swirl in your head...

# Quest: Venting the Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAzg.name=§6§lVenting the Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAzg.desc=A low tech method to cool down the hot coolant is to use vent covers. Just place the cover on any GregTech block which can contain IC2 coolant and place water in front. The easiest might be just a tank or pipe. This will help until you have access to a Large Heat Exchanger or a Vacuum Freezer.%n%nAn advanced or overclocked reactor vent is much faster than a basic heat vent and can work without a water block in front of it, albeit slower. Unfortunately, you can't make those yet, but you can keep that in mind for later.

# Quest: Clay Electrolyzing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-A.name=§6§lClay Electrolyzing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-A.desc=If you looked through NEI you may have found out that electrolyzing clay dust will give you Alumina, Silicon Dioxide, Sodium, and Lithium dust. And water, but you're probably just voiding that already, right? There are plenty of stained clay blocks found in canyon, mesa, lush desert biomes or several to a couple dozen on mountains that can be pulverized to clay dust.%n%nThere are more ways to get alumina now that you're in MV, enough that it's basically worthless by the time you get to EV.

# Quest: Bio Fuels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC2g.name=§6§lBio Fuels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC2g.desc=You've been using steam, creosote, and possibly oil plus their byproducts to generate power. It's time to start making bio diesel. The first step is to make plant balls out of organic materials. You can use wheat, sugarcane, apples, saplings or, well, practically anything. Indigo blossoms are 4:1 and unlike the rest of the IC2 crops with the same ratio, not really useful for anything else. Realistically, you'll probably just use saplings though, since you'll want/need a tree farm anyway.%n%nBe sure you have a Forestry multifarm, Steve's Carts Farm, IC2 Crop Sticks with a harvester, or whatever, because you need plenty of biomaterials for constant bio diesel production.

# Quest: Plantballs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC2w.name=§6§lPlantballs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC2w.desc=Next you should compress plantballs out of your wheat.%n%nThe MV compressor is twice as fast as the LV. You might think this means using it is a good idea. Well, it depends. Remember it also uses 4x the power. This means you spend 2x the EU in total to get the same amount of EU out. If you overclock too much in your fuel production setup, you end up with an EU deficit! Overclocking once is usually well worth it though.%n%nEventually you want to use multiblocks for better speeds and efficiency!

# Quest: Plant Mass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3A.name=§6§lPlant Mass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3A.desc=Macerate the plantballs down to plant mass for better processing. The HV macerator has an extra slot so you can get more, but it's not worth it power-wise, same for EV and IV.

# Quest: Bio Chaff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3Q.name=§6§lBio Chaff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3Q.desc=Plant mass needs to be centrifuged into bio chaff, the base material to make biomass.

# Quest: Way One: IC2 Fluid Canner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3g.name=§6§lWay One: IC2 Fluid Canner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3g.desc=The first way you get biomass out of bio chaff is to use the IC2 Fluid Canner. One bucket of water and one bio chaff gives one bucket of biomass.%n%n[warn]This option is not really recommended. You should focus on GT machines, not IC2. It also has some buggy interaction with normal cells, you might need to use universal cells.[/warn]

# Quest: Way Two: Brewery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3w.name=§6§lWay Two: Brewery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3w.desc=If you are lucky and find some brewing stands or have started using Thaumcraft to make one, you can craft a brewery. You get 1000mb of biomass out of 1000mb water and 1 bio chaff. Use Distilled water to get a better ratio and a much faster recipe.

# Quest: Fermented Biomass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC4A.name=§6§lFermented Biomass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC4A.desc=Fermenting your biomass allows you to get more products out of it like methanol, ethanol, ammonia, etc.

# Quest: Extrude All the Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5A.name=§6§lExtrude All the Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5A.desc=Now that you've hit MV tier, it's time to get a better ratio when making rods, pipes, wires, plates and many more parts. Most extruder recipes use more than 32 EU/t so you need an MV extruder. After crafting the machine you need extruder shapes for the different types of parts you will want to make.%n%nThere are a few more shapes than the ones listed here. Make sure to have a look.%n%n[note]Most of the Tinkers Gregworks tool parts are made in the extruder. They also have long extrusion times to balance out their usefulness.[/note]

# Quest: Solar Grade Ingots
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6g.name=§6§lSolar Grade Ingots
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6g.desc=To turn your solar grade dust into solar grade ingots you need to use an EBF with kanthal coils and then cool the resulting hot ingots in a chemical bath.

# Quest: Are You Prepared For HV?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC7Q.name=§6§lAre You Prepared For HV?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC7Q.desc=Stainless steel will be the tier material for HV. Use an MV mixer to produce the dust.%n%nManganese can be acquired as ore byproducts from spessartine, pyrolusite and tantalite ore. You can also pull them apart to get even more. Alternatively you can take apart Red Garnet dusts. If you get desperate, you can buy some ore from the Coins tab.%n%nChrome can be electrolyzed out of ruby dust. You can get ruby dust from redstone if the ruby in redstone veins isn't enough.

# Quest: Molten Plastic

# Quest: Speeding Up Slow Machines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIPg.name=§6§lSpeeding Up Slow Machines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIPg.desc=Many mods don't have methods of speeding up their slow machines. For this, you'll need a GregTech World Accelerator. It guzzles amps though, so your power infrastructure better be ready for it. The tooltip will list the performance boost provided. For block-based acceleration, the WA will do an area around it. For TileEntities like most machines, it will only accelerate the blocks directly touching the WA, and will need to be reconfigured with a screwdriver. This uses twice the power though.%n%n[warn]This does not work with GregTech machines![/warn] For those, build more or higher tier ones.%n%nIf you want, you can change the level of acceleration by using a wrench on it. It will go back to the minimum, then increase one tier from there for every usage. It will use that tier's amount of power (and acceleration), increasing as per GT standard of 2x speed (acceleration) and 4x EU per tier.

# Quest: Welcome to the Church of Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIXQ.name=§6§lWelcome to the Church of Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIXQ.desc=If you made it to MV using steam, you're probably wondering how to survive going further. One option is to switch to Light Fuel, discussed in LV. Another option is to use Benzene. Benzene is made from Wood Tar. There are a couple of pathways for that. Both start with logs from trees.%n%nOne path is to use Coke Ovens or Advanced Coke Ovens to make Charcoal, and fluid-extract Wood Tar from it. Then distill the Wood Tar to make Benzene. This method produces less pollution, but will also provide less Benzene.%n%nThe second path is to use the Pyrolyze Oven multiblock and Nitrogen gas to extract Wood Tar and Charcoal. Fluid-extract the Charcoal for additional Wood Tar. Then proceed as above. This method will create pollution from the Pyrolyze Oven, but will provide more Benzene per log.%n%nExcess wood tar can also be turned into Toluene, a key ingredient for explosives that you'll need later on to make rockets.%n%nIf you use the Charcoal Byproducts recipe, you can get a plethora of useful byproducts as well, but you'll need 4 DTs.%n%n[note]Later on you will get an even better option in the form the Industrial Coke Oven.[/note]

First, you need to use some Sulfuric Acid to melt off any impurities in a Chemical Bath, leaving you with Crushed Rare Earth (I). After that you need to process it like a normal ore until you get Rare Earth (I) Dust.%n%nAfter running the Dust through your Dehydrator, you get a number of strange materials, only some of which you recognize. But if you run these materials through an Electrolyzer or through the Dehydrator again, you may get some use out of them. Some of them may take quite a few to do so, but you §o§o§r§h§ohave§r been stockpiling, right? You'll need 204 Rare Earth.%n%nYou believe if you had more powerful acids and machines, you could extract even more valuable materials out of the Rare Earth.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHVQ.desc=Now you can actually make the UUM with a Mass Fabricator. Well, technically you could make it without UUA, but that's way more expensive. To make sure it only runs with UUA, put a programmed circuit (any value) in the machine's slot. UUMatter can be used for some very specific things, such as replicating §osome§r materials (check NEI, mostly/all periodic table), used with crops to create an ore, some specific high-level recipes need it, and...you can also sit in it to get regen.%n%nThe energy usage and overclocking of the Mass Fabricator is different from the usual GT way. To have fixed EU to UUM ratios for all tiers, the machine does perfect 2/2 overclocks. It also starts with a very high amperage in LV. The following chart should make it more clear:%n%nTier  Amps       EU/t         Time%nLV     8A         256          160%nMV     4A         512           80%nHV     2A        1024           40%nEV     1A        2048           20%nIV     0.5A      4096           10%netc.%n%nPut in power (and hopefully UUA), and out comes UUM.%n%nFor now, just stockpile the UU matter.

# Quest: Getting Your First Platinum
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI9w.name=§9§lGetting Your First Platinum
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI9w.desc=Efficient Platinum processing is quite complicated. But for now, we can just smelt it directly into nuggets. This might not be the most efficient route to take, but it is enough for what we want to do next.%n%nAt this tier, your best source of Platinum is Nickel ores from the Twilight Forest, or maybe Endstone Dust if you've managed to survive the End already.

# Quest: Hidden Drawers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJXg.name=§9§lHidden Drawers

# Quest: Controlling Your Drawers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJaA.name=§9§lControlling Your Drawers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJaA.desc=Now that you have MV Circuits and Stainless Steel, you can make the incredibly handy Drawer Controller. This block will make any drawers it connects to in a 4-block radius (including the y-axis) and 50 blocks at maximum as part of a multiblock that allows storage (and retrieval with the right setup) to any of the blocks that make it up. This will allow you to dump the contents of your mining trip into a storage system much easier. Just hold right-click on the Controller front for a second or two, and any items that match what's already in the multiblock will be deposited, while your tools and such won't. Just make sure to place your Controller last so it registers all the drawers.%n%nYou can feed into the Controller (and thus the rest of the drawers) with any kind of piping or hopper equivalent. If using it as part of a Multifarm or Mob Farm, make sure to set the contents of the drawers, and lock them with a key so that it properly stores everything in an organized manner. If the drawers' contents aren't set, it will start filling starting from the ones closest. If you wish to have more than one drawer full of an item, put a void upgrade on the drawer further from the Controller, and it will fill the first one, then the second.%n%nIf you want to go around corners, use the Trim Drawers to extend the multiblock. If you want to have a second point to dump items into, use the Controller Slave (one per multiblock, automation only). Note that you can use a key on the Controller to affect all drawers at once.%n%nOnce you have an ME Network, place a storage bus on the Controller, and the entire inventory will be accessible from the network, with both storage and retrieval. Just remember to set the priority higher than your ME Drives. If you haven't locked them yet expect all your drawers to fill with random items from your ME Network.%n%n[warn]Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will tank TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.%n%nAdditionally, expect all non-backpack interactions to be DISABLED on the official servers. Congratulations, Drawer Cubists, you ruined it for everyone.[/warn]

# Quest: Power of the Sun from Nuclear
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAg.name=§a§lPower of the Sun from Nuclear
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAg.desc=Your good old singleblock Molecular Transformer is gone. So how to obtain Sunnarium? Well there are a couple of ways, but at EV you'll need to radiate Glowstone and convert to Sunnarium.%n%nThe Glowstone rod will slowly charge up if you put it next to any fuel rod in your IC2 reactor. The exact charging speed is (number of rods adjacent) * (floor(hull temperature/3000) + 1) per second. A dual rod will count as 2 rods and quad fuel rod will count as 4 rods for this purpose. The Glowstone rod will neither emit heat, nor cause other component to emit more heat. You can treat this rod as a reactor plating in the IC2 Reactor Planner.%n%nAs you can see, the speed is directly proportional to hull temperature and rods adjacent. At the very extreme you can fully charge up a Glowstone rod in less than half a minute and output one Sunnarium every 10 second (on average, since cells aren't charged at same speed due to different position), but that require very considerable resource to set up. It also involves a vacuum freezer to cooldown the coolant cells and running the reactor at 66000+ hull temperature. Balance your need and your resource situation wisely. In any case, if you just wish to charge it up FAST then here is a possible string for the IC2 Reactor Planner:%n%nerp=bpO50cpsdtJElVqn4hObFJc0tiOE0JpEHYpqTxJHvyezjSKRjUuwgouXzNOlU4a3hFBRygM=%n%nReplace Containment Reactor Plating with actual Glowstone rods and you should be good to go.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMDw.desc=When you inevitably get Samarium Ore, you'll end up getting a ton of this dust. There are a couple of options here: One includes the monazite line and has a higher yield, the other is simpler but has a poorer yield.%nWe'll look at the latter here.%n%nEventually you'll probably want to switch entirely to the monazite option, but for now, supplementing it with this can be a good idea.

# Quest: Finally, Samarium!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEA.name=§b§lFinally, Samarium!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEA.desc=(And Gadolinium)%n%nEasy, right? Not to worry, there's always the bastnasite line to stay your hunger for complex lines!%n%nSamarium can be used to fuel your ever growing Magnetic Samarium Rods needs from LuV up to UHV while Gadolinium is used in the far lategame in the making of powerful Compact Fusion reactors.

Sneak-middle-click to lock the can; while locked, you can't accidentally change the color. Sneak-middle-click to unlock.%n%nNaturally, you'll have to craft the infinite spray can yourself. It's a Dire Crafting recipe, so hopefully you have a dire crafting table. It requires a lot of platinum line materials, of course. And, apparently, a rainbow cactus, so a small detour into magic will be necessary. And a bunch of random-looking AE2 parts. And an IV world accelerator. And... a fence?%n%nIs this really a reward?

# Quest: Thorium 232?
betterquesting.quest.nNTmwkdsQgyE6QAfmIwcvg.name=§b§lThorium 232?
betterquesting.quest.nNTmwkdsQgyE6QAfmIwcvg.desc=So you were looking at Thorium 232 and wondering how to make it?%n%nYou could centrifuge it at a horrible chance rate with a long recipe but there are better ways of obtaining it.%n%nThe better ways are processing chains that can be made in three different paths with the third path being unlocked at a further stage after obtaining Fusion with the Neutron Activator.%n%nThe first path requires the chemical plant multiblock that you might not be familiar with but will become required to create rocket fuel for any tier three or higher rocket. This path is the fastest with only two steps to obtain the Thorium 232, but requires borax which can only be obtained (for now) through mining salt veins as a byproduct or through bees (probably the better option if you already have some).%n%nThe second path is a six step processing chain that requires Chemical Reactors, a Centrifuge, and an EBF. Even though it is longer it offers much better conversion ratio (75%% instead of 25%% in chemical plant), instead of borax it requires nitric acid (4000L per dust if you account for recycling) and 100L of fluorine per dust.%n%nEither way I would recommend using AE2FC as it allows on demand fluid crafting which will assist in both processing chains.

betterquesting.quest.u_-8t2IvRnydvmUx_qdYuA.desc=If you have a stable Samarium resource acquisition, refining Samarium Ore should be the best way to get Samarium.%n%nAs the first step, dissolve some Samarium Ore Concentrate Dust or Crushed Samarium Ore (you probably don't have access to this option yet) in Nitric Acid in a Digester to get Muddy Samarium Rare Earth Solution. Thorium and Phosphate are retained in the form of a solid slag powder.%n%nThen transfer the muddy solution to a Dissolution Tank and continue to soak it in nitric acid. The undissolved powder is then meticulously filtered out, yielding some Cerium.%n%nThen dilute the result with water to adjust the pH.

# Quest: Industrial Water Purification
betterquesting.quest.-2oHGhi4Q22pvhQHb3IaCA.name=§c§lIndustrial Water Purification
betterquesting.quest.-2oHGhi4Q22pvhQHb3IaCA.desc=For a while now, you have been able to get away with cutting and engraving your silicon circuit wafers with nothing but the bare metal of your machines. However, this can cause significant imperfections in the final wafer, so now that you are producing even more advanced circuitry such imperfections are no longer tolerable.%n%nWith the ability to make LuV components, you can now make the Water Purification Plant. This multiblock allows you to make purified water, which will be helpful in making wafers of increasing purity and perfection. For your current Naquadah-Doped Wafers, this is not yet necessary, but using purified water may significantly speed up the process, so it's definitely worth checking out.%n%nThe Water Purification Plant does not run recipes itself. Instead, it provides the core logistics for your water purification line to work. Around it you can build water purification units that link to the Water Purification Plant. The plant then provides power and maintenance to the different units, and synchronizes their recipe cycles.

# Quest: Automated Mining
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyQ.name=§c§lAutomated Mining
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyQ.desc=The QED enables you to assemble the most convenient device for mining: The ender quarry.%n%nAs 0lafe says, "This small black box is life-changing" and "Sympathy for the amount of dense obsidian plates you need."%n%nGuess you better get compressing!%n%n[warn]NOTE: It's best to place your quarry and markers on orevein boundaries.

# Quest: Starting Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEvA.name=§l§c§lStarting Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEvA.desc=Now that your power needs are increasing, you need a way to keep up with demand. To generate over 1A ZPM with a single machine you have two options: solars, and fusion.%n%nWhile solars are simpler to set up, solars cap out at 524288 EU/t. Fusion can reach levels close to eight times that with the right setup.%n%nFor your first reactor, you will need a controller, 2-16 fluid input hatches, 1-16 fluid output hatches, and 16 energy hatches. All hatches have to be LuV tier or better. Each hatch provides 2048 EU/t for the recipe, and has a storage capacity of 10M eu.%n%nThis means you can do any fusion recipe that takes less than 32768 EU/t or less, and has a startup cost of 160M EU or less. Using more fluid hatches means you need less fusion casings. While this doesn't matter as much for the mk1 reactor, this principle helps tremendously with the higher reactor tiers.

# Quest: Getting Europium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEvQ.name=§b§9§d§l§b§c§lGetting Europium

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAErQ.desc=Now that you have some Europium, put it to use by making a MK II reactor.%n%nThis one will require the same block placement, but replaces LuV casings with fusion machine casings, superconducting coil blocks with fusion coil blocks, and uses ZPM tier hatches.%n%nEach of the up to 16 ZPM Energy Hatches adds 8192 EU/t power input and 20 MEU starting capacity. Therefore this reactor can handle recipes up to 320M EU at startup. In addition, if you perform a MK I recipe on a MK II, you will overclock it. Fusion overclocking is different from normal GT. It will take 2x the power and the recipe will go 2x faster.

# Quest: Making Americium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAErw.name=Making Americium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAErw.desc=To upgrade your reactor further and to make UV motors, you will need to get some americium. The recipe is pretty expensive, but once you made the next tier of reactor, you will unlock a simpler and cheaper one. However, to get there you will need a lot of americium already, so better make sure you are producing enough lutetium.%n%nLet's start with just 48 ingots. Enough for a single UV motor.

# Quest: A Vision of the Future (FPS Drop Not Included)
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKSg.name=A Vision of the Future (FPS Drop Not Included)
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKSg.desc=To get to the Toxic Everglades, you'll need 10 Containment Frames and an Alkalus Disk (Activated). You use them like when making a nether portal. The disk can also be used to set special fires. It doesn't spread across the ground that well, but it'll take out a tree real fast. If you want to get rid of a giant tree, this is your tool.%n%nThe dim itself is filled with GT++ ores. If you want the ore distribution to make sense/be greggy, badger Alk about it.

# Quest: Cheaper EV Circuits

# Quest: Wasn't This Only Found in the Center of Neutron Stars?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKbQ.name=Wasn't This Only Found in the Center of Neutron Stars?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKbQ.desc=You'll need Neutronium for UV and the T7 rocket, so let's make some.%n%nTo get Neutronium, go to one of the planets that has the small ores. Then mix it with Helium Plasma to make Raw Neutronium Dust. It can be smelted in a Blast Furnace at 9000K and 491,520 EU/t. This recipe takes a long time and a lot of power. Better make another EBF or Volcanus. Or a few. Or upgrade your Mega Blast Furnace.

# Quest: Data Bank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKbw.name=Data Bank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKbw.desc=By now you probably feel overwhelmed with the number of data sticks needed for your Assembly Line. TecTech has a solution for you: The Data Bank. It allows you to store more than just 16 data sticks and can be connected to multiple Assembly Lines at the same time.%n%nPlace the controller one block above the ground and use the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector to see how it is built. You will need a Maintenance Hatch and at least an EV Energy Hatch, though the power requirements can be much higher if you use many Data Access Hatches and Data Bank Master Connectors, for now you should start with an LuV energy hatch. Trying to run the Data Bank and then scanning the controller will tell you how much eu/t is needed.%n%nYou will need more blocks than what is asked for in this quest, as the number of Data Access Hatches and Connectors is up to you. You can have a maximum of 15 combined.%n%nThe Assembly Line Reception Connector replaces your old Data Access Hatch on the Assembly Line. Connect it to a Master Connector on the Data Bank with Optical Fiber Cable and make sure to color the hatches and the cable.%n%n[note]If you can't figure out what blocks to place, pay attention to the tooltip in the bottom-left when using the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector. In this case the filler blocks are Computer Casing.[/note]

# Quest: Paint-by-Numbers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKdg.name=Paint-by-Numbers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKdg.desc=If you want to color all those fancy cables and such, you'll want to use the humble Paintbrush. To uncolor them, use a bucket of water.%n%nAlternatively, you can also use the IC2 Painter, GT Spray Can, or the AE2 Color Applicator.%n%n[note]The buildcraft paintbrush and GT spray cans can now color many cables or pipes in a row with just a single click![/note]

# Quest: TecTech Multiblocks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKeg.name=TecTech Multiblocks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKeg.desc=TecTech Multiblock Common Functionality%n%nMultiple Ampere and Laser Hatches Compatibility - to ease power distribution.%n%nPower Pass - Allows connected dynamo hatches to take power from the controller and output it, just like the active transformer does (and that is why the controller always need it in its recipe if that function is enabled...). [warn]Be sure to turn off Power Pass if you want to edit your machine and don't want it to explode![/warn]%n%nConstructable Interface - Allows visualizing the structure with blueprints (there is an API to implement that for any block, but almost nothing does).%n%nFrom left to right is 1, then clockwise for the rest in TT multi interfaces.%n%n1) Parameters - They are the way of the controller to communicate with player and parameter hatches. Lights indicate status but more detailed information can be seen when moused over. The tooltip contains ID in form of HatchID:ParameterNumber:Direction, Current Status, Current Value, and Short Description.%n%n2) Uncertainty status - These 9 blocks indicate uncertainty status of the machine. If the lights are on, this machine requires an uncertainty resolver. Red = Bad, Green = Good. You need to do the absurd puzzle before using the machine.%n%nControl buttons - Buttons might change their behavior and appearance depending on machine but usually they work like this, starting from top:%n%n3) Power Pass - Toggles Power Pass.%n%n4) Safe Void - Currently unused.%n%n5) Power Switch - Soft Mallet with your finger...%n%n6) Input slot - Standard functionality.

# Quest: Configuring TecTech Multiblocks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKew.name=Configuring TecTech Multiblocks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKew.desc=Many TecTech multis can be customized by adjusting certain internal numbers called parameters. You can directly adjust them in the GUI.%n%nIf there are lit up sections in the parameters part of the multi interface (see the TecTech Multiblocks quest), you can configure the multi, otherwise there is nothing to do.%n%nWe'll be using the Quantum Computer as our example, since that is what you probably want it for.%n%nFirst we need to understand the parameter naming, like ID:0:1:I. The first number represents the parameter block. For the QC only block 0 is used. Each such block can have up to 4 used parameters, 2 inputs and 2 outputs. The letter at the end specifies if a parameter is an input or output with I or O and the number in the middle distinguishes the 2 parameters of this kind in the block. It is either 0 or 1.%n%nInputs are something that is either set or is a default. Outputs give information that the machine sends to you, that indicates things. (like heat or Computation)%n%nAnd lastly, the Parametrizer Memory Card lets you copy settings from one machine to another easily.

# Quest: Lasers Solve Everything
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKqg.name=Lasers Solve Everything
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKqg.desc=Laser hatches are a high-end way of sending lots of amps of power, so much in fact, that it starts at 32A. This goes 32/64/96/128/256+ and continues from there. They're also so powerful that only a few machines support them outside of the ever §owonderful§r TecTech: LSC, MBF, MVF, and PSS. Remember to paint the Laser Vacuum Pipes, the Source Hatch, and the Target Hatch. Also, Source = Output, Target = Input. Laser Vacuum Pipes do not split or bend, to turn your laser use [note]Active Transformer[/note]. Later on you can use Laser Vacuum Mirror to bend your Laser Vacuum Pipes, this will however not allow splitting.%n%n[note]Laser hatches can have their operational amperage adjusted in their GUI.[/note]%n%nLaser Converters are basically: Laser Source (on machine) -> Vacuum Pipes -> LC -> 5x output split into X amps, 32 for the first. Make sure to put it into receive mode. Or do it the other way around if you want to go up. It's basically a transformer that converts laser to/from cables. You can also use them to turn the lasers if you don't mind 3x the loss on device output (and not sending all the amps) compared to the Active Transformer (because of loss on each output). Just remember to put a battery buffer in between if you want it to work.%n%n[note]You can use the Low Power Laser Pipes if using a 'Low Power' Hatch or Converter, but keep in mind you'll need to connect them with wire cutters yourself after coloring them.[/note]%n%n[warn]Be careful with using very high amp hatches as every Laser Hatch has 1EU/s * max amps passive power loss. For example, a 256A Laser Source Hatch and 256A Laser Target Hatch will both lose 256 EU/s regardless of the amount of power flowing through.[/warn]

# Quest: Enriched Naquadah Ingot
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALZw.name=Enriched Naquadah Ingot
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALZw.desc=Ah, you made it.%n%nYou can choose to smelt it with zinc in an EBF or electrolyze it. Either is fine but you can fully recycle the zinc, so the EBF recipe is better if you want the ingot.

# Quest: Enriched Naquadah Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALaA.name=Enriched Naquadah Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALaA.desc=The enriched naquadah line is much shorter than the naquadah line, and easier. It's used for fuel or Neuro Processing Units which are UV content, so if you don't want to build a line for it, just ignore these quests.

# Quest: Concentration

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALhg.name=N.N.Q.Q.N.Q.Q
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALhg.desc=Do you want some naquadria?%n%nUnfortunately, the naquadria dust has become repulsive naquadria oxide mixture dust because of a NERF. You have to build a line for it, like the naquadah.

# Quest: Purification
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALhw.name=Purification
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALhw.desc=The barium will react with sulfuric acid and become insoluble dust so we can remove it.

# Quest: Recycle Indium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALiA.name=Recycle Indium

# Quest: Disproportionation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALiQ.name=Disproportionation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALiQ.desc=The chemical properties of naquadria are a bit weird.%n%nThere's nothing known that can precipitate it. The only way to get naquadria from the solution is to use high energy particle to bombard it.%n%nHowever, only a part of the output naquadria can be used for further processing and you have to re-purify the rest.

# Quest: Once again
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALig.name=Once again
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALig.desc=The miscibility of P-507 and naquadria is still very perfect like naquadah. Most naquadria can be concentrated again.

# Quest: pH Neutralization
betterquesting.quest.eon8hLumTS-E7MYJ4TFT3w.name=pH Neutralization
betterquesting.quest.eon8hLumTS-E7MYJ4TFT3w.desc=If you want to process your Europium-Doped Wafers with a significant speed boost, this machine is for you. Using the pH neutral water you get from this machine, you can process wafers twice as fast.%n%nThis is the first real complex automation challenge in the waterline, it's up to you to figure out how you want to deal with the pH neutralization process. Have fun!%n%n[note]This multiblock is very picky about where its hatches for acids and bases go. If you can't figure out why it's not forming, chances are you forgot to place these hatches in the correct location. Use the hologram projector to see where they go.[/note]

# Quest: Superdense
betterquesting.quest.sB_lbhZZRnmZNjJiF8-1Hg.name=Superdense
betterquesting.quest.sB_lbhZZRnmZNjJiF8-1Hg.desc=The advanced machines you are now creating require more advanced materials, as well as more advanced ways to process them. In ZPM, you can construct the Hot Isostatic Pressurization Unit, an upgrade to the Large Electric Compressor. This multiblock heats material to extreme temperatures under extreme pressure, allowing it to create superdense plates with minimal imperfections.%n%nThe HIP Unit heats up while it is running, and must be given some time to cool off. If it reaches its maximum heat threshold, it will significantly slow your recipes or even void the inputs. Use better coils to increase how long it will take to overheat, and use Heat Sensor Hatches to automate it properly.%n%n[note]Can perform compression recipes which say "Requires HIP Unit" in NEI.[/note]

# Quest: Flocculation
betterquesting.quest.sZ9d2SzSSLSc9tccXG_L4g.name=Flocculation
betterquesting.quest.sZ9d2SzSSLSc9tccXG_L4g.desc=You want to start using your new Europium to make even better wafers, but it turns out that your old methods of creating purified water are no longer enough. You will need to use the Flocculation Purification Unit to make even better purified water first. To run this machine, you will need large amounts of Polyaluminium Chloride, but luckily you can get all your Chlorine back if you properly recycle the waste liquid.


## Quest Line: Tier 8 - UV
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALQ.name=Tier 8 - UV
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALQ.desc=Ultimate Voltage! This is the final tier in normal GregTech, but here in GregTech: New Horizons, we pierce the heavens to go beyond the limit! You have done something that only a few players are capable of doing. Welcome to the Endgame!

# Quest: Upgrading the Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAErg.name=Upgrading the Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAErg.desc=A MK II is nice, but why not make a MK III? This time you will need UV or above hatches, as well as the Fusion Machine Casing MK II.%n%nEach of the up to 16 UV Energy Hatches adds 32768 EU/t power input and 40 MEU starting capacity. Therefore this reactor can handle recipes up to 640M EU at startup.%n%nWhen using it for lower tier recipes, the reactor will double the power needed per recipe, while cutting the processing time in half, both for each tier difference.

# Quest: I Put Fusion in Your Fusion so you Can Fusion While You Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsg.name=I Put Fusion in Your Fusion so you Can Fusion While You Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsg.desc=To make Oganesson, you'll need to make Californium. To make that, you'll need Beryllium and Plutonium 239, all in the Fusion Reactor. After the two fusion chains, you'll have the best noble gas in the pack, which is used in several places.%n%nIn this tier, you can send it to Void Miners, to increase their ore production speed, or EBFs, to make them run faster, although the EBF option is too weak right now (changes coming soon). Later on, Oganesson will be used in other places, like the optical circuit line, or to produce Metastable Oganesson, which is needed in much larger quantities later on.%n%nOganesson replication is on the way out, and the fusion recipe has improved a lot, so there is no longer an incentive to replicate and your Fusion Reactor should keep running for Og.

# Quest: Time for Another Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsw.name=Time for Another Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsw.desc=While one reactor is nice and all, why not make another? This time you can use the MK3 americium recipe to make it easier.%n%nCosting just 1 ingot of Plutonium, and 2 cells of hydrogen, this recipe is much easier and faster than the MK2 version. By making americium plasma, then putting it through a turbine, you will get americium in the liquid state. You will need at least 132 plates for the controller and the fusion machine casings.%n%nPlus, free power!

# Quest: Americium Doped Wafers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH-Q.name=Americium Doped Wafers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH-Q.desc=These boules are the last ones, and are the most efficient when making wafers out of them.

# Quest: Quantum Computer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH1w.name=Quantum Computer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH1w.desc=The Quantum Computer (QC) is an incredibly complicated machine used to generate computation for the Research Station and a few other multiblocks. There are a few things you need to understand before using one.%n%n§lCONSTRUCTION§r. Much like an assembly line, the QC is built as a series of slices. The first and last slice are the only valid locations for hatches. The slices in between are primarily for computer racks. The Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector shows the minimum length QC, but holding multiple in a single stack will show/build longer versions up to the maximum length of 16. There is also a mandatory air block in front of the computer heat vents.%n%n§lOUTPUT§r. Computation is nothing more than an integer input for certain recipes--much like EU. There may exist a minimum throughput requirement, a threshold to reach, or both (NEI will tell you everything). Computation is generated every second by the QC, transmitted by an Optical Transmission Connector, received by an Optical Reception Connector, and "consumed" by the machine or process that needs it. There is no storing computation and there can only be ONE transmission or reception hatch connected to the same Optical Fiber Cables at a time. If absolutely necessary, the Network Switch with QOS can split/join connections but know that it takes both power and maintenance to run.%n%nAdditional QC can be chained together using another set of Optical Transmission and Optical Reception Connectors between machines, but they cannot wallshare the same Optical Transmission Connector.%n%n§lUNCERTAINTY§r. The QC has a unique maintenance requirement that can only be corrected by balancing the Schrödinger Matrix inside an Uncertainty Resolver--an additional hatch that must go on either the first or last slice of the machine. Start with the basic Uncertainty Resolver, but know that there are two more tiers unlocked later on that lower the difficulty of the puzzle, or not?%n%nThe interface of the Uncertainty Resolver has the Schrödinger Matrix in the middle and two sets of 8 buttons on the left and right. Clicking on one button and then another will switch the states of the two corresponding cells in the matrix. This means switching their blinking speed (in the basic Uncertainty Resolver) or their shade/color (in the Uncertainty Resolver X). The goal of the puzzle is to balance the states of the matrix around the glowing LED lights, turning all of them green.%n%n§lPARAMETERS§r. In the GUI of the controller, there are two configurable parameters, overclock and overvolt, that change how computation and heat are generated. Higher overclock values contribute the most to computation and higher overvolt values contribute the most to heat. Alone, this would encourage the player to make overclock as high as possible and overvolt as low as possible, but there is a penalty to computation for large differences between these two parameters. Furthermore, overvolt values <1 will cause the QC to randomly drop computation proportional to its distance from 1. It is highly encouraged to play around with these parameters, as all the best setups do.%n%nSee the adjacent quest for more information on computer racks and generating computation.

# Quest: Research Station
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH2A.name=Research Station
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH2A.desc=Now that you've started building up your precious Quantum Computer, how about the Research Station? Once again, using the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector will tell you how to build this Multiblock. There should be 3 empty blocks beneath it so you can see the whole blueprint. Once it is nearly assembled, place down an Energy Hatch, an Optical Reception Connector, and a Maintenance Hatch all on the back side.%n%nOnce fully assembled, you can begin operating recipes at any time, so long as the Quantum Computer is also active and connected. The Research Station requires you to put the item to research within the Object Holder, then a data stick in the Multiblock interface. Once the Computation is fully completed, the data stick that houses all the data of the completed item will be inside the Multiblock Interface.%n%nStill confused? Good, that's the spirit of learning! Always make sure to test these things in creative single player if you wish to find exact measurements and such. Don't forget to ALWAYS COLOR THE OPTICAL HATCHES AND FIBERS!%n%n[note]Note that some researches require a significant amount of power, so keep that in mind.[/note]

# Quest: STERILIZE!, STERILIZE!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKWQ.name=STERILIZE!, STERILIZE!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKWQ.desc=Turn your Raw Growth Medium into Sterilized Growth Medium in an IV Fluid Heater, and then you can use it in the Wetware Lifesupport Circuit Boards or the Neuro Processing Unit. But you'll also need to use it to make stemcells, so let's do that first.

# Quest: The Board that Keeps Life
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKWg.name=The Board that Keeps Life
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKWg.desc=To make Wetware Circuits, you'll need to make a Wetware Lifesupport Circuit Board. Making this board is quite a different process than making all the other Circuit Boards you've made, because making it actually requires materials!%n%nTo actually use it in circuits, you need to etch it. I guess by now, you know how to etch a circuit board, so I won't tell you and you have to use NEI :P

# Quest: This is Not How You Make Cheese
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKWw.name=This is Not How You Make Cheese
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKWw.desc=In order to make Wetware circuits, you'll need Sterilized Growth Catalyst Medium and Stemcells.%n%nTo begin, you will first need Bacteria which you can get through the Bacterial Vat or the Brewing Machine. The vat recipe is more efficient, but you need a culture for it so you need to start with the brewing recipe. The Bacterial Vat needs at least Bismuth rods in the Radio Hatch for the proper Sievert and at least EV-tier glass to make Bacteria. There are also 3 different recipes, so you can use a higher tier one later if you like.%n%nYou'll also need Mince Meat and Agar. You'll want a stable supply of meat such as a fish farm, a standard animal farm, or IC2 Meatrose/Goldfish farm.%n%nAgar has a more complicated processing chain, but it's nothing compared to Platinum. You'll need even more meat for it.%n%nUse some of the Bacteria to create an Ova Evolutionis culture (15%% chance), and then place that in the Bacterial Vat's controller. The Bacterial Vat also needs at least Uranium rods in the Radio Hatch for the proper Sievert and at least IV-tier glass to make Raw Growth Catalyst Medium. There are higher tier recipes for this as well.%n%n[note]Cultures are NOT consumed in the Bacterial Vat.[/note]

# Quest: Which Doctor? THE Doctor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKbg.name=Which Doctor? THE Doctor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKbg.desc=If you haven't made one before, go check out the quest in MV linked from the Robot Arm about how they work. This one gives the maximum boost, 256x, and uses between 1.5M-3M EU/t, so make sure your power grid can handle it, or dial it down.

# Quest: Neutrons From Space
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKcQ.name=Neutrons From Space
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKcQ.desc=Now let's make Cosmic Neutronium, a material that is used in a lot of late game stuff.%nCentrifuge Black Plutonium to get a Pile of Neutrons. It can then be compressed to Cosmic Neutronium Nuggets in an Implosion Compressor.%n%nCompress the nuggets again to make a Cosmic Neutronium Ingot.%n%n[note]Avaritia's Neutronium and GT Cosmic Neutronium are oredicted together, it's not the same as normal GT Neutronium. It goes back to being called SpNt if you craft it into something, like a plate.[/note]

# Quest: Quantum Mechanics is Hot
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiw.name=Quantum Mechanics is Hot
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiw.desc=The QC has 2-24 computer racks depending on the length of the machine. Each rack has four total slots for either circuits (to generate heat and computation) or vents (to dissipate heat). Although conceptually similar to a nuclear reactor, the location of the components inside does not matter at all. Every rack is also completely independent from every other rack which means it is not possible to have one rack with all circuits and another with all vents.%n%nThe computation of a rack is the sum of all the components' individual computation. For example, two APU (Tier 3) and two Cooling Cores have 240 + 240 + 0 + 0 = 480 base computation per second. However, computation changes significantly depending on the values for overclock and overvolt:%n%n[note]Computation = Base * (1+overclock^2) / (1+(overclock-overvolt)^2)[/note]%n%nThe heat of a rack is a value between 0 and 10,000 and is reported in the interface of the QC or by using a Portable Scanner on the rack. Every component has a certain heat limit which if exceeded will void that component. Breaking or wrenching a rack while it is hot (>2000) will similarly void the components inside. The QC will explode if the heat exceeds 10,000 but no component has a heat limit greater than that, so don't worry too much about ruining your base.%n%n[note]Heat α HeatConstant * overclock * overvolt^2[/note]%n%nThe power consumption of a rack is 1A ZPM regardless of the components inside. This is in addition to the 1A ZPM of the QC itself. However, these EU/t values are directly proportional to overclock and overvolt which should increase as you unlock better circuits. Be sure to turn on the QC before the research station and only when you need it.%n%n[note]EU/t = 131,072 * overclock * overvolt * (racks + 1)[/note]%n%nTo get you started, craft 4x APU (Tier 3) and 4x Cooling Cores. Place two of each component in the two racks and the QC will safely produce 1,920 computation/s for just 393,215 EU/t (0.75A UV) which is more than enough for researching the Wetware Mainframe. If you would like to further increase the computation/s at the cost of power, adjust the overclock and overvolt values to 1.44 and 1.03, respectively. This will generate 2,526 computation/s at a cost of 583,217 EU/t (1.11A UV).%n%nIf the APUs are too bothersome to craft, try Crystal Mainframes instead but you will need different overclock and overvolt values to get the most out of them. That goes for every unique combination of circuits and vents.

# Quest: Fluids for Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKlw.name=Fluids for Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKlw.desc=Ok, so let's say you've made some kind of culture, but you want more of it? You only need one per Vat, but they're consumed when making DNA Samples, so you should probably learn how.%n%nTo start off, you'll need to get an eColi Culture.%n%nUse that to make the eColi Bacteria Fluid. [note](I know the name is completely different, deal with it)[/note]%n%nCentrifuge that to make Liquid DNA.%n%nAnd combine it with Radon in the Mixer to make FluorecentdDNA.%n%neColi Bacteria Fluid can also be Centrifuged for Plasma Membranes (10%% chance) and EnzymesSollution, so do that as well.%n%nAnd then Centrifuge the EnzymesSollution again for Polymerase.%n%nYou should expect to need a significant amount of eColi Bacteria Fluid if you plan on copying a lot of cultures, or making the hard to make ones.%n%n[note]To search for items related to copying cultures, search for 'culture', 'dna sample', or 'plasmid'. You can't do this for the Data Orbs, you have to check the uses of DNA Samples.[/note]%n%n§5A bunch of the fluids have incorrect spelling, don't blame me for it.

# Quest: DNA Samples for Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmA.name=DNA Samples for Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmA.desc=To copy cultures, you'll need to make a DNA sample first. Many of these have low chances, but this one's 100%%. I'm sure you can figure it out yourself, but keep in mind that the Modules are not consumed, and that you may wish to use one of the IC2 Crops for the Detergent materials.

# Quest: Data Orbs for Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmQ.name=Data Orbs for Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmQ.desc=After getting your sample you need to encode the information to a Data Orb. Again, many times you'll have to do it repeatedly (the Data Orb is given back if it fails), but in this case it's 100%%.%n%n[note]Look at the uses of the eColi DNA Sample to see the recipe.[/note]

# Quest: Actually Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmg.name=Actually Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmg.desc=To copy a culture, you'll need%n1) A Sterilized Petri Dish%n2) A Plasma Membrane (made from Stemcells, or gotten while making EnzymesSollution)%n3) Stemcells%n4) A Data Orb with the appropriate data on it%n5) Liquid DNA%n6) A UV Bio Lab%n7) A Clonal Cellular Synthesis Module%n%nYou can change out the Data Orb for one with whatever culture you wish to copy. Keep in mind that it might be easier to make a second culture the normal way, and that there's generally an alternative recipe that uses the fluid it produces to make it with a higher chance.%n%nPS: This recipe is the only one in NEI that uses this module, so you can find it if you look, but the number will change, so I can't specify which page.

# Quest: General Purpose Fermenting Bacteria
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmw.name=General Purpose Fermenting Bacteria
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmw.desc=So if you looked in NEI and tried to figure out how to make this, you were probably confused by the fact that you use the fluid it produces to make it. This is where NEI is lying to you. Like the previous recipe, NEI doesn't show it correctly (they should be around the same page in NEI, they both also appear to produce Sterilized Petri Dishes, (even if that's not true) and both use unique Modules).%n%nIn order to make this, you'll need to make the Rotten Flesh Bacteria culture, get the DNA Sample, and then get the Data Orb. It changes its name to beta-Lactamase, that's normal.%n%nThen, do the same thing for Common Yeast (get the right Yeast!).%n%nThen you need to use the recipe to combine the information from the Data Orbs and get the Common Yeast Plasmid from that.%n%nLastly, use the Rotten Flesh Bacteria culture, the Common Yeast Plasmid, Penicillin (make it by centrifuging Common Yeast Fluid), and Distilled Water. You want the Transformation Module for this. It's a 100%% chance.%n%nYou'll want to use the normal recipe to make more cultures, since it also becomes beta-Lactamase once you turn it into a DNA Sample.

# Quest: Kevlar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0g.name=Kevlar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0g.desc=There is a new material that can be used for some high tier crafts. The production line is long and tedious but you should know how to use NEI by now, right?%n%n[note]Hint: If you don't feel like automating a 52 step chemical line, you could also have a look at the Kevlar bee and the new QFT if you are sufficiently high tier.[/note]

# Quest: Space Elevator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0w.name=Space Elevator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0w.desc=The Space Elevator is a modular structure. It can be equipped with Space Elevator modules, which then can take on different tasks.%n%nInitially, your Space Elevator has 6 module slots that can be used. You can later upgrade that to up to 12 with Mk-II and Mk-III motors. The motor tier also determines the module tier that you can use. The I/O is not shared between modules, each module only sees their own I/O slots. Energy is only provided to the central structure of the Space Elevator and then automatically distributed to all modules.%n%nAfter a module has been inserted and supplied with the right I/O, it can be configured further using parameters.%n%nYou can see in NEI which fluids are pumpable with the Space Pumping Module. It consumes 1A UHV to work. The Gas Type and Planet Type are parameters.%n%nNEI also has an overview of all the ores you can obtain with a Space Mining Module. It needs to be supplied with a drone, which will act as catalyst, a set of input items, computation and either Helium, Bismuth or Radon plasma. The plasma will boost both the recipe time and the amount of bonus stacks you get out of a recipe. With its parameters you can adjust parallels, overdrive, and distance. When multiple recipes have the same input and you have the distance set to a value that they share, the module will pick a random one, taking the recipes weights into consideration.%n%nThe space elevator also lets you travel to other planets, but it doesn't get you back though so better keep that in mind!%n%nThe mining module also got a cycle mode. In static mode it will hold its distance while in cycle mode it will change its distance after each recipe check (and you can configure the range and step size of that).%n%nHere's a good spreadsheet to check material chances and other values, across motor tiers, for this multi: [url]https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xRApa3HnQiJDstr8I5csIi24Mx4mJNsalRJh8PVa52M/edit#gid=1497391303[/url].%n%n[note]Teleportation can be accessed though the controller.[/note]

# Quest: Extract what you want

betterquesting.quest.LzCq9t0cT4-_TizIr_Iq_A.desc=Directly dissolve and chlorinate of lanthanide ores in Degister to get the concentrated solution of the corresponding ore. Then use the corresponding Extracting Nano Resin to extract the main material in the solution. The rest (Chlorinated Rare Earth Concentrate) is still rich in useful lanthanides.%n%nYou can use any type Extracting Nano Resin to extract the useful things in the rest. What Nano Resin you use, what lanthanide you'll get. Every bucket of Chlorinated Rare Earth Concentrate can do this extraction 3 times. First Concentrate to Enriched Solution, then Enriched Solution to Diluted Solution, then waste liquid.%n%nAfter extracting, the Nano Resin will be "Filled". Put them "Filled" into Electrolyzor then nanites will transfer the "Particles" out from the resin under the influence of electric field. And you can get the Nano Resins and let them go into the next work round, again and again without breaks.%n%nYes, Rare Earth will not be Rare. Bless the Nano Tech.

betterquesting.quest.gKMT2pblSg69VL5tAtlfxA.name=Nano Resin - Particle Extractors
betterquesting.quest.gKMT2pblSg69VL5tAtlfxA.desc=Arrange Nanites in P-507 and label them with target particle information in the high-energy laser beam environment of a laser engraver. Then we get the Extracting Unit called "Nano Resin".%n%nThese Nanites automatically capture the target particles in solution and store them in the resin. It is worth noting that the actual production rate will be limited by the number of Nanites. So if you want to use this method to produce lanthanides in large quantities, you need to prepare more extra Nano Resin.%n%nHere are all 15 types of Extracting Nano Resin.

# Quest: Purifying Water With Plasma
betterquesting.quest.pMGI_sXdQSKWWFFxTunqvA.name=Purifying Water With Plasma
betterquesting.quest.pMGI_sXdQSKWWFFxTunqvA.desc=As usual, before you can make use of your Americium to make better wafers, you will need better water. This time, we're going to use plasma to rapidly heat up the water and then cool it back down.%n%nSome of the mechanics may seem similar to how you set up the pH neutralization process, maybe you can expand on what you learned there?%n%n[note]This multiblock is very picky about where its plasma and coolant input hatches go. If you can't figure out why it's not forming, chances are you forgot to place these hatches in the correct location. Use the hologram projector to see where they go.[/note]

# Quest: Advanced Crystal SoC Production
betterquesting.quest.yo1cuNvYSU2JAczbJLAfjg.name=Advanced Crystal SoC Production
betterquesting.quest.yo1cuNvYSU2JAczbJLAfjg.desc=We can process Crystal Processing Units in a Laser Engraver to get the Crystal SoC. But as our demand for circuits gradually increases, this method of production is becoming untenable. We need a more advanced way to mass produce Crystal SoCs!%n%nFor that we use a new material, Cerium-doped Lutetium Aluminium Garnet (Ce:LuAG). LuAG has better performance when making Crystal SoCs - in fact it is a laser crystal material.%n%nFirst, mix Lutetium, Aluminium, Oxygen, and a little Cerium to get the material blend. Then put the blend with Molten Lutetium into an Autoclave to get a regular LuAG gem. If you have already got Oganesson you can also directly use that. As the second step, use the LuAG gem and more of the blend to produce Exquisite LuAG Gems.%n%nAfter you get the first gem, you can also use your Autoclave to grow crystals. Using Vacuum Furnacee might be a better choice to produce Exquisite LuAG Gems.%n%nLutetium, Lutetium, it needs a lot of Lutetium. How will you get a lot of Lutetium?

# Quest: One Ingot, Infinite Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKcw.name=One Ingot, Infinite Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKcw.desc=Here at Questbook, Inc. we are seriously worried about your health if you got here legitimately. Playing this much might be bad for you. You can always go outside, you know?%n%nBy the way, to make the ingot, it's just a simple Dire Crafting Table recipe. Remember that you were the one that chose to be here.%n%n[note]A number of endgame recipes have now opened up. Check the Endgame Goals tab or NEI recipes for the Table to see what they are.[/note]%n%n[note]Something else to note is that there's an automated DCT if you happen to need a lot of these (hint: you will).[/note]

# Quest: Collecting Neutrons the Alternate Way

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKdA.desc=Now that you have Infinity, you can use the Avaritia Neutron Collector to get Piles of Neutrons. It does not use any power.%n%n[note]Warning: This machine is extremely slow, so you might want to use something to help with that...[/note]

# Quest: Soldering's Not Working Anymore
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKdw.name=Soldering's Not Working Anymore
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKdw.desc=After all these advancements, it looks like some things just aren't meant to be. Every machine that your Assembly Line has crafted works, but the most advanced ones so far seem to be... a bit rough around the edges. Further inspection revealed that Indalloy just isn't good enough. It seems that Infinity's neverending vibrations destabilize the joints where the soldering happens, your living circuits have been offering resistance to this crude soldering alloy, however that happens...%n%nIt's likely that new materials will completely break Indalloy's ability to get pieces soldered together. Because of that, it's about time for a new development in this technology, and the previous rejection by your living circuits has given you an excellent idea. Any new material can have some new behavior that will ruin assembling for you, but what if the solder itself learns about these complications and learns how to adjust to them, mutating for them?%n%nThat's right: §aMutated Living Solder§r.%n%nThis sort of chemistry is only possible in a full-scale Chemical Plant, equipped with the most advanced casing: Botmium. On top of that, the catalyst you need to use has been consumed so thoroughly that you were forced to use Infinity for it, on top of the mutating Naquadria. Your Infinity will be lost to the crafting, still, unless you manage to put [note]Tungstensteel Pipe Casings[/note] and [warn]Awakened Draconium Coils[/warn] in your Chemical Plant, which prevent the catalyst from losing durability. Any better coils also have the same effect.%n%nThe new solder itself is a different story. Wetware technology is too primitive for this, and your Bio Cells have refused to bond with any fluid that would serve as its carrier for soldering. When you tried a mixture of hot Tin and Bismuth, it finally worked, but the soldering didn't actually work. It looked like the Bio Cells hadn't learned how to fulfill their new job, which could be fixed by adding an example material as a test subject, something simpler like Infinity Catalyst... but it seemed impossible to bond the cells to the dust. You need more energy... not just loads of EU, something concentrated, hot, fizzling with energy!%n%nYes, everything alive died instantly when you decided to add plasmas instead of hot fluids. No surprise there. However, Bio Cells did survive inside hot fluids, so we just need some temperature control here, and some separation between cell and plasma... yes, Gravi Stars can be used for this. We still need to cool down the plasmas, so that the enhanced cells can mix with them in liquid form, and EU alone would be too expensive. Gelid Cryotheum has proven to be surprisingly efficient, perhaps due to its origins, as a component of a living being, the Blizz.%n%nThere we go! The Mutated Living Solder is now complete. The highly intelligent Bio Cells are energized by the concentrated heat of the plasmas, while keeping a distance from them due to the Gravi Stars' influence, and they analyze the Infinity Catalyst Dust to learn about material instability. This is a very slow process, but it happens at the same time as the plasmas are slowly cooled, using Cryotheum and EU, until the learning process is complete and the Bio Cells fall into the Tin and Bismuth, now in the liquid form that was shown to work before. Finally, armed with their new knowledge, the cells flow through the Naquadria-based, Infinity-reinforced catalyst so that they can mutate in real-time after researching the material they're soldering.%n%nThis should work for any future soldering need, regardless of material. Let's hope so, at least...

# Quest: Industrial Scale Seaweed Production
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKeQ.name=Industrial Scale Seaweed Production
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKeQ.desc=So you probably noticed that the amount of seaweed you'll need to make Bio circuits is kind of...intense. Collecting them yourself is a huge pain, and who wants to program robots? Plus servers. Fortunately, there's now a way to make seaweed.%n%nThe first thing you need is...Seaweed! Use that with Unknown Water you pumped from the same planet to make the culture. Expect this to take a while, as the chances are super low. You'll also need the max tier Bio Lab.%n%nOnce you have the culture you can make SeaweedBroth, by combining it with UnknownNutrientAgar and some other stuff. This can then be made into seaweed.

# Quest: Beyond the Limit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiA.name=Beyond the Limit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiA.desc=To make living solder for your UEV components or bio-circuits, you will need a chem plant with Rugged Botmium Casings. These are not easy to make!%n%nYou can certainly figure out the rest by now, but the Advanced Nitinol may confuse you. You make it out of blocks of Nitinol 60 with a Quantum Anomaly in a Laser Engraver. This means you need to make a UV Cyclotron, and hit several low chances in a row, so good luck with that!

# Quest: Xenoxene Xenoxsis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKnQ.name=Xenoxene Xenoxsis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKnQ.desc=To make the next tier plastic, Radox, or the next tier of SMDs, you will need Xenoxene.%n%nGetting the Xenoxene Xenoxsis culture is a bit tricky. The recipe is similar to the General Purpose one. Remember that all recipes in this chain are low probability recipes.%n%nYour first step is to make the Barnardafis culture, then the DNA Sample, and then the Data Orb. If you didn't grab the saplings and dirt previously (to grow more trees for logs), head back to Barnarda C.%n%nUse the same recipe as for the General Purpose one, but use the Data Orb for Barnardafis instead of Common Yeast. You should get the Barnardafis Plasmid.%n%nAgain, it's the same recipe for the next step, but with the TCetiEis Fucus Serratus culture and the Barnardafis Plasmid, this should produce the Xenoxene Xenoxis culture. It's a 7.5%% chance.%n%nYou should probably use the normal alternative recipe to make more cultures, since it's easy to fail copying it too.%n%nYou should be able to figure out yourself how to make Xenoxene once you have the culture.%n%n[note]After many years, the transformation recipe now even has NEI support![/note]

# Quest: Optical SMDs

# Quest: Wait, PBI wasn't the last plastic?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsQ.name=Wait, PBI wasn't the last plastic?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsQ.desc=Let's make a brand new plastic! The trees that you found on Barnada C have very interesting properties. Still, you can't just use the extracted radox substance raw. Some serious refining steps are in order!%n%n§6You'll need it for a ton of stuff like UIV and UMV superconductors, UEV+ hatches, or parts of the Dyson Swarm.§r%n%nCompared to the previous plastics, most of the steps required here are not chemical reactions. They are also very slow, so you might want to use a mega multiblock to help with that. This production line also underlines the necessity of large-scale plasma production. You will only need more going forward.%n%n[note]Super Heavy Radox will be needed for Dimensionally Shifted Superfluid, so store some for later.[/note]%n%n[note]The Heavy Radox you get as a byproduct can be used for MkV Naquadah Fuel.[/note]

betterquesting.quest._vOu6ZYdRiOqLN_5-uBU_A.desc=Now that you have the bioware mainframe, you have unlocked the first of the stargate trophies!%nYes, there's multiple of them, one for each major iteration of the stargate recipe.%nThese trophies are just that, trophies, and you can try to craft them if you want to compare the costs to today's stargate standards.%nTo complete these quests you have to submit two stargates' worth of materials.%n%n§3Now, let me bestow upon you a short history lesson about this point in GT:NHs past.%n%nThe year is 2020. The bio mainframe was pretty much the end of GT:NH progression at the time, not much above UHV existed or was craftable. This was also the point in the pack where you'd start scaling for stargate, as that too was tiered at UHV. Technically UEV parts were craftable, but their only uses were singleblocks for PAs (which only held up to 16 UEV machines) and the Deep Dark Portal. UEV-UMV energy hatches were craftable, but their recipes were simple hull + wire crafting table recipes%n...and that was about it for UHV+ content.%nWith the recent addition of void miners, the previously thought to be impossible started to seem actually attainable, a set of stargates. Specifically, to §ocraft§3 a set of them, not just find them like others have before.%n%nOne group in particular, known as the §aGigaplex§3, gave it their all and actually managed to do it, to prove that crafting stargates is possible with enough determination.%n%nThus, on the §a16th of February, 2021§3, the first set of crafted stargates had been born.%n%nP.S.: If you want to be as faithful to the challenge as possible, try completing this quest without using any of the modern functionality that didn't exist back then.%nHere's a non-exhaustive list of major things that didn't exist (in no particular order):%n-PCB Factory, Space Elevator, Component Assemblyline, AAL, PrAss, EEC, EIG, Compact Fusions, MCR, MABS%n-Any bee related GT machines%n-Any UEV or above multis%n-XL Turbines, Naq fuel, LEG%n-Sub 1-tick OC, Batch Mode, inbuilt Void Protection on multis%n-Level Maintainer, AE Fluid Crafting, Stocking Buses/Hatches, Crafting Input Buses, ME Output Buses/Hatches, non-recursive AE component recipes%n-Shift-clicking recipes into AE patterns (pain)%n-Early-Midgame QoL such as ghost circuits, visual prospecting, reprogramming circuits with a screwdriver, seeing Assline recipes in NEI before having crafted them, and more%n%nP.P.S: This quest is missing the chaotic capacitors on purpose, because the chaotic core recipe requires spacetime now, but the chaotic capacitor recipe did not change at all since then. All in all the cost for these banks was completely negligible back then and still is today, they only serve as a magic gate for SG.

# Quest: Dragonblood
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsA.name=Dragonblood
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsA.desc=For your first batch of Hypogen you will need some Dragonblood. Maybe you already have some lying around somewhere from killing the dragon a long time ago. You have 2 other options though. Bees and the DE Fusion Crafter.%n%nFor the bee path you have to go very deep into the breeding tree, but maybe you have already done that? Check the Bee Breeding tab either way.%n%nIn the DE Fusion Crafter you have 2 recipes. The better one uses an Infinity Egg from Witchery. Without any Witchery you can also just a normal dragon egg for the weaker recipe.%n%nOnce you have a bit of Hypogen you can then use that as a starting point to make more in your DTPF without any Dragonblood. I don't know why it works that way, complain to Colen.%n%nHowever, you will still need more Dragonblood eventually for UMV superconductors.%n%n[note]There is actually another way to get Dragonblood which is similar to the DE Fusion Crafter recipes but in the mixer instead. It's even slower and less resource efficient. In particular, the dragon egg does not survive the process. So only use that if you are absolutely trying to avoid magic and bees.[/note]%n%n[note]Just a reminder: a fluid task just needs you to have the fluid in some container in your inventory. (cell, universal cell, large cell, volumetric cell, etc.)[/note]

Time for stargate trophy number two.%nOnce again, to get your trophy you have to submit two stargates' worth of materials.%n%n§3Trophy number two brings us to chapter two of our journey through GT:NHs past, the early UEV era.%n%nThe year 2022 has just begun and the UEV tier, albeit still quite empty, has become more useful than before. UEV-UMV energy hatches now have proper recipes (although with UEV parts) and optical SMDs are a thing now, hooray.%nThere finally are better powergen options than regular plasma turbine spam, namely naq fuel and compact fusions + XL plasma turbine spam. Technically dyson too, but that is horribly bugged and its 'legit' power output reasonably can't exceed around 6 billion eu/t (around the same as a compact MK4 running helium plasma).%nSome useful newly introduced multis are the PrAss, MCR & Mega Oil Cracker and overclocks past MAX voltage are possible on megas now.%nStargate has once again become a distant goal, as it now required exorbitant amounts or infinity catalyst and bio circuits, requiring to utilize the new tech to its fullest.%n%nTwo players, §aPhineasor§3 & §aGDCloud§3 were determined to be first to completing this goal, and after months of a close friendly race, the winner had been decided. §a%nGDCloud§3 won the race and conquered this round of nerfs on the §a27th of May, 2022§3.%n%nP.S.: Once again, if you want to be faithful to the challenge, try completing it without these additions:%n-PCB Factory, Space Elevator, Component Assemblyline, AAL, EEC, EIG, MABS%n-Any bee related GT machines%n-Any UEV or above multis (except weak dyson and naq refineries)%n-LEG%n-Sub 1-tick OC, Batch Mode, inbuilt Void Protection on multis%n-Level Maintainer, AE Fluid Crafting, Stocking Buses/Hatches, Crafting Input Buses, ME Output Hatches%n%nP.P.S.: Again the chaotic capacitor banks have been left out for the same reason as stated in the UV gate quest. Oh and the stargate parts used to be UXV recipes, but since UMV hatches are not craftable in UEV anymore, they have been downtiered to UIV to make them craftable in UEV.

betterquesting.quest._TtL1y6-SfCCNKRrWSvrNQ.desc=At last, you have done it. The DTPF is a mighty multiblock fueled by large amounts of power and catalyst. Running it constantly for 8 hours or longer reduces catalyst consumption by 50%%, so you will want to find a way to automate this to save on expensive catalyst.%n%nYou will need 2112 coil blocks in total. Accepted coil tiers are%n%n- Awakened Draconium%n- Infinity%n- Hypogen%n- Eternal%n%nWhile you can start with Awakened Draconium coils, you will need at least infinity coils to make tesseracts for UIV, so it may be worth it to skip to those immediately%n%n[note]Perhaps it can be used to bake exotic cookies?[/note]

Not a single quark is out of place in Grade 8 Purified Water. Thanks to this purity, even more advanced processes are possible, starting with reducing the processing time of Optical Boules and increasing yield on Optical Chips.%n%nWhile the tooltip is certainly a lot less intimidating than the one of the Degasser, automating this process will not be an easy challenge.

betterquesting.quest.gOySBVKnSAiJk0Fie9k55A.desc=To run the DTPF, you will need to feed it excited catalyst. There are four tiers of catalyst you can make right now, and one more to unlock later. Making these catalysts requires a lot of power and time, so you will almost certainly want to passive this with many machines.%n%nIn UIV, you will unlock the §p§oplasma mixer§r, a dedicated multiblock that can make catalyst much faster than you currently can, although this comes at an enormous power cost.

betterquesting.quest.0YrjX7i4QfeSo98gSE0SWg.name=§b§lHeliofusion Exoticizer
betterquesting.quest.0YrjX7i4QfeSo98gSE0SWg.desc=Using large quantities of graviton shards creates regions of space so extreme that exotic forms of matter can exist with far greater stability than usual. Unfortunately, this region is so extreme that it is essentially spatially disconnected from the rest of the Forge, unable to utilize existing upgrades to the structure and its other modules.%n%n[note]The fourth and final module of the Godforge, Heliofusion Exoticizer allows for the production of Quark Gluon Plasma and Magmatter. Initially only Quark Gluon Plasma is possible, with Magmatter requiring a much later upgrade. Consult the Godforge Information section of the UI to read how to produce these materials.[/note]%n%n[note]Usage of this module requires the QGPIU upgrade.[/note]

# Quest: Pseudostable Black Hole Containment Field
betterquesting.quest.6OibD9bRQwq_hBPWz-y9xQ.name=Pseudostable Black Hole Containment Field
betterquesting.quest.6OibD9bRQwq_hBPWz-y9xQ.desc=As the materials around you achieve transcendental properties, you have found that traditional modes of compression like pistons or gases will not be enough to compact them as densely as you require.%n%nThe solution? Using the sheer force of gravity. By using extreme amounts of explosive force on your fourth-dimensionally engineered tesseracts, you can tear tiny rifts in the fabric of space, enough to create a seed which can birth a black hole. If you can build a machine which can harness it, it will be able to compress even the strongest materials to the most dense states possible.%n%nTaming a black hole is no easy task - even with all of your precautions, it defies your efforts to stabilize it and attempts to collapse itself constantly. Meaningfully extending the lifespan of the black hole will be extremely difficult. By bending spacetime through carefully aligned glass, you can reverse the flow of hawking radiation back into the black hole and keep it completely stable - problematically, however, the amount of spacetime required to maintain this process increases at an exponential rate.%n%nAs the black hole decays, it becomes even more powerful - but be wary, as it will eventually become unstable and you will no longer be able to recover your items from the edge of the event horizon. To safely close the black hole and restart this process, you have engineered a collapser out of the same fourth-dimensional materials.%n%n[note]The Pseudostable Black Hole Containment Field is the most powerful compressor in the game, capable of creating superdense plates out of any material, as well as being able to perform more advanced neutronium compressor recipes that will save incredible amounts of resources.[/note]%n%n[note]You must use programmed circuits in the input buses to determine if the machine will act as a Compressor or Neutronium Compressor![/note]

betterquesting.quest.GslQBIW9QKaCz7FFpkrv6g.desc=As usage of the Forge continues, more data on graviton shards is gathered. It has been found that they can stabilize the outputs of the Forge, allowing for the direct extraction of molten material while it is still close to the heart of the star.%n%n[note]The second module of the Godforge, Helioflux Melting Core allows processing EBF recipes by directly outputting molten metal when possible. This may not always be as efficient as other methods, but the time and scaling saved from Vacuum Freezer steps often more than makes up for this.[/note]%n%n[note]Usage of this module requires the FDIM upgrade.[/note]%n%n[warn]Helioflux Melting Core <3[/warn]

# Quest: Star Fuel and Dark Matter

betterquesting.quest.Jk9jZtb6SXSLNX9SND_J0A.desc=Transcendent Metal is the primary metal used in UIV components.%n%nThis metal is a bit different from the ones you have been processing so far. You need to macerate your tesseracts to get the dust and then blast it at such high temperatures that you'll need a coolant to help manage the heat.%n%nDue to the impossible nature of the tesseract particles, you'll need a medium to enable them to form 3D shapes. Tungsten, for some reason, works very well for this purpose.%n%nThe ingot itself is also not very stable; therefore, a coating of titansteel must be applied during the cooling process.%n%n[note]Consider passively generating it.

However, through continued use, one can slowly upgrade and expand the range of abilities of the Forge, and learn the power hidden in the most extreme parts of the universe: [note]Graviton Shards[/note].%n%nThis esoteric material can only be found where conventional matter and degenerate neutronium crust matter on the surface of a neutron star meet. At this point in space, gravitons are far more common and irradiate this material mixture to create highly unstable graviton shards, which can be used to internally upgrade the Forge. While these shards cannot yet exist outside the extreme conditions of the Forge, with continued research and utilization it may be possible to eventually isolate and extract them outside the Forge - but for what purpose?%n%n[note]Click on the logo in the UI to read more on how to operate the Godforge.[/note]

# Quest: Convergence
betterquesting.quest.XoEzTtuPQjyeHTyqp9eY8Q.name=Convergence
betterquesting.quest.XoEzTtuPQjyeHTyqp9eY8Q.desc=Running your Dimensionally Transcendent Plasma Forge for an extended period [note](8 hours)[/note] allows the Multidimensional Spaces to align perfectly.%n%nWith your newly acquired technology, you can now tap into these spaces in perfect sync, enabling your plasma forges to operate at incredible speeds.%n%nThe Transdimensional Alignment Matrix allows the DTPF to run with Perfect Overclocks. To achieve this, you need a full discount, and the extra power cost is offset by using more of the same catalyst.%n%nOverall, it is more efficient and totally worth it.%n%nThis process is extremely catalyst-hungry. Ensure you're producing enough to sustain it.%n%nFor recipes without a catalyst, you must specify the catalyst in the GUI by right-clicking the Convergence button, otherwise it will default to Crude.[/note]%n%n[note]Math for the curious:%n%nTo clear up what exactly happens in the background, here's an explanation on how the extra catalyst values are calculated using an example:%n%nThe example recipe of choice is the molten neutronium recipe using prosaic catalyst, running at 64A UMV (8,589,934,592 EU/t).%nThe recipe uses 14,753L of Prosaic catalyst and 36,484,545,600 EU per recipe without OCs or the catalyst discount. With the discount, the catalyst amount gets cut in half, meaning 7,376.5§ L of catalyst, which are rounded to 7,376L, and due to the 64A UMV the machine is supplied with the recipe overclocks 3 times, meaning each recipe actually uses 36,484,545,600 * 2^3 = 291,876,364,800 EU.%n%nKnowing the amount of OCs and the base voltage of the recipe, the difference of the needed EU per recipe with and without perfect OC can be calculated, that being 291,876,364,800 - 36,484,545,600 = 255,391,819,200 extra EU due to imperfect OCs.%nTo get the value of needed extra catalyst, this extra EU value has to be divided by the energy density of the relevant catalyst, prosaic in this case.%n%nThe division equates to 255,391,819,200 EU / 66,768,460 EU/L = 3,825.037 L, rounded to 3,825L extra prosaic catalyst per recipe. For the final step, this value has to be multiplied by 0.5 as it's affected by the discount, meaning the total extra catalyst that gets added to the recipe is 3,825L * 0.5 = 1,912.5 L, rounded to 1,912L.%n%nTo summarize it all in a formula:%nAmount extra catalyst per recipe = (B * ((2^x) - 1))/2L%nwhere:%nB is base total EU of the recipe%nx is the number of overclocks%nL is the EU/L of the relevant catalyst [/note]

I must be able to craft all sorts of cool endgame things with this... right?%n%n[note]Currently, besides EOH casing upgrades, White Dwarf Matter is not used anywhere on its own, often paired with Black Dwarf Matter or other later materials. Save it up for now and keep upgrading that EOH![/note]

# Quest: Black Dwarf Matter
betterquesting.quest.bPYTUdlkSCiRi0eDHHw7tw.name=Black Dwarf Matter
betterquesting.quest.bPYTUdlkSCiRi0eDHHw7tw.desc=Reinforcing your casings with matter from white dwarfs was a good idea.%n%nYou can now accelerate a solar system until a black dwarf forms.

# Quest: Subspace Cooling
betterquesting.quest.hybMIjq9Q9mxxWKEE8gBWQ.name=Subspace Cooling
betterquesting.quest.hybMIjq9Q9mxxWKEE8gBWQ.desc=Cooling exotic ingots proves to be a much bigger challenge than smelting them.%n%nFortunately, reinforcing some of the casings with your new materials allows you to inject exotic coolants that capture extreme heat in miniature tears of spacetime, helping to cool your ingots a bit faster.%n%nWith Subspace Cooling, you can enable the Vacuum Freezer to achieve Perfect Overclocks… at a cost.%n%nTier 1 will consume SpaceTime in liquid form at [warn]7500 L/s[/warn] and allow for 1 Perfect Overclock.%n%n[note]This cost is very high but static, remaining the same for each recipe being run. So, be selective about cooling your ingots.%n%nThe faster the recipes, the more efficient the cost, so find your optimal balance.[/note]%n%nThe Infinity Cooled Casings replace the Frostproof casings, so you don't need to worry about damaging your setups.

Depending on your GUI scale it might have multiple pages.[/note]%n%n[note]Well... it explains mostly everything. The Eye of Harmony has an inbuilt pity system to make sure you don't lose your mind. Here's a quick rundown on how it operates:%n%n(All chances are decimals here)%nThere is a counter C that starts at the current recipe success chance P. If a recipe fails, (1-P)*P is added to C. If C reaches >= 1, the next roll is guaranteed to succeed and C resets to P. %nIf a recipe succeeds before C reaches >= 1, it resets in a similar manner.%nIf you switch recipes, C will be reset to P of the new recipe, even if the next roll would be a guarantee.%nThe guarantee can be cancelled out by overflow penalties as they apply after the pity does. However, they do not reset C, so the guarantee is shifted to the next recipe cycle.%nIf parallels are > 1, pity doesn't apply.[/note]%n

# Quest: Analyze Your Crops
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBQ.name=Analyze Your Crops
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBQ.desc=The cropnalyzer is a powered tool used to analyze IC2 crop seedbags. Charge it by placing it in an MV machine; it is recommended to also place an MV battery in it to keep it fully charged. To fully analyze a seed bag, you will need to put it through the cropnalyzer four times. If the crop is already planted, it is better to analyze it with the portable scanner instead of breaking it just to scan it - you have a chance of losing the seed every time you break it.%n%nThe cropnalyzer also has a feature called the IC2 Crop Calculator, where you can find the mix of outputs of breeding together any crops. To access the calculator, hit the IC2 side inventory key while holding the cropnalyzer. You can select any crops available and discover what plants have decent percentages of a result. And no, you can't do the reverse, search for the crops.zip on discord for that (it doesn't have micadia though).%n%nYou can choose up to four crops to breed together. Then click "process" and the bottom row will show the possible crossbreeding outputs, and their weights. You can use the + and - gui buttons to scroll through the row(s) of crops. You can also use a button in the GUI to sort the rows by tier or weight. You can invert the sorting by hitting the sorting button while holding shift.%n%nWhen trying to get a specific crop, you generally want to maximize its percentage. Do this by breeding 2-4 of the same plant together (more is faster). There is no advantage to crossing plant types, it just reduces the %% chance of getting what you want, contrary to what you might think.%n%nUse the crops guide at [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/IC2_Crops_List[/url] for more details.%n%nA large field of stickreeds has a good chance at making lots of valuable crosses. This is because it's decently high tier (they randomly mutate to tiers nearby mostly), and it's really fast, so you can get it to a high stat fast, which you should probably do first. Mutations are random, you can get transformium from stickreed, so keep that in mind. You do tend to get similar crops, so if you want metals, get the metal crops for example. Go to the wiki or spreadsheet (not up to date) to see the attributes that govern similarity.

# Quest: Crop Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBg.name=Crop Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBg.desc=The Crop-Matron is a LV machine that will monitor crops in a 11x11x3 area and automatically apply fertilizer, Weed-EX, and Water as needed. Water can be pumped in directly or use IC2 Universal water cells, normal cells aren't returned when they're used.%n%nThe Crop-Matron is rainproof, but make sure you cover up your power supply (you might find a fancy way to do this), or use an LV battery. A Lithium Ion will last about 2 hours.%n%nTilled dirt still requires a nearby water block to be hydrated as the Matron will only water the crop, not the soil. Try putting a lily pad on top so it isn't annoying to walk on, or using Garden Soil instead.

# Quest: Weed Ex
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBw.name=Weed Ex
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBw.desc=Weed-EX is used to prevent the growth of Weeds on empty Crop blocks at the cost of some weed-EX. Damage to the crop's quality is illusory, and not true. We have people that have looked at the code, we assure you. §oUnless§r it counts as a weed (venomilia Gr 8+, any other crop Gr 24+), then it loses maybe 1 stat. Maybe. And you can just increase it again too. And it might not take effect even then if you don't apply too much, like a crop matron won't.%n%nUsage:%nWhile holding Weed-Ex, right-click on a Crop to apply it. It can also be placed in a Crop-Matron to automatically apply it to your crops.

# Quest: Reed and Resin
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQA.name=Reed and Resin
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQA.desc=One of the first useful crops you'll get is Stickreed. It's fast growing, and can produce sticky resin and sugarcane (harvest before it reaches full maturity). It's also great for crossing with other crops to raise their stats. One of the best strategies is to get these to around 20/31/10, then breed out from there. Most people will say 23/31/10, but 24+ act like weeds, so it's better to have some wiggle room.%n%nI'll trade you some fertilizer for 2 stacks of each.%n%n[note]PS, you don't really need rubber trees if you can get these.[/note]%n%n[note]You'll need a Basic Scanner to scan your Stickreed seeds once you get them, though any set of stats will work. See the quest in LV, and note it requires MV circuits.[/note]

# Quest: Metals From the Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQQ.name=Metals From the Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQQ.desc=With higher tier crops you can even increase your ore production. Mixing some of these fibers and leaves with crushed ores can quadruple your output, and some can even be converted directly to dust. Later you can mix these materials to make purified ore with some UU matter.%n%nShow me your ability to get these metal crops and I'll give you some more fertilizer and some decent stat seedbags of rarer crops. Good source crops are essence berries or any of the oreberries.%n%nYou will need the proper oreblock beneath the crop to reach 100 percent maturity. For best growing conditions use dirt in between the oreblock and the crop.%n%nFor Ferru and Aurelia you will have to use a block of metal instead of a GT oreblock - a vanilla oreblock automined from the Twilight Forest will however work. You can also buy some from the coins tab. WAILA will tell you if the crop will accept the block you are using.

# Quest: Water, Water, Everywhere
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQg.name=Water, Water, Everywhere
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQg.desc=Even though you have to plant crops near the water, they don't actually get any hydration unless you apply water manually. Make a hydration cell and use it on your crops to increase their growth speed.%n%nYou can recycle empty cells in an extractor.

# Quest: Feeling a Little Like a Noob...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQw.name=Feeling a Little Like a Noob...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQw.desc=So could you grow me some essence berries so I can level up? You can plant the ones you get from the bushes, or breed up some.%n%nAs a reward, I'll give you a silly seed a friend of mine came up with. It will definitely keep you on your toes.

# Quest: Put the Petal to the Metal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRA.name=Put the Petal to the Metal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRA.desc=... with the Bio Diesel you produce from Canola!%n%nYou can try getting it from dandelions, cocoa, potatoes or lemons.

# Quest: Better Than Milk
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRQ.name=Better Than Milk
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRQ.desc=I haven't been feeling well lately. Would you grow me some Terrawart? They're better than milk, since they only remove negative effects, and stack to 64. Really nice when fighting that Alchemist infernal!%n%nThey also have Auramx8, Praecantatiox4 and Victusx4 essentia on them, very useful for the budding thaumaturge. And you can get them by placing a snow block under your netherwart and waiting instead of mutating to get them.

# Quest: Sweet Tooth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRg.name=Sweet Tooth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRg.desc=Sugarcane or Reed not keeping up with your sugary needs? Sugar beets give 8 sugar per beet. Potatoes or carrots should easily give you sugar beets.%n%nHmm, now I want some candy. Give me some sugar from your beets. I'll share some with you.%n%n[note]Electrolyze the sugar into O2 for an easy source.[/note]

# Quest: More Useful IC2 Crops

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRw.desc=Once you get into crops, consider trying other crops that may be of interest. Don't underestimate them, they can be quite strong if used well!

# Quest: More Red, Less Wheat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGyQ.name=More Red, Less Wheat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGyQ.desc=When breeding together crops for an output crop, try to get crops that are close in tier to the output crop, and have similar attributes to the output crop.%n%nFor example, Redwheat has "Red", "Wheat" and "Redstone" attributes and is tier 6. Netherwart has "Red" and is tier 5. Use the cropnalyzer crop prediction mode to see how many points Redwheat has using two Netherwart.%n%nYou'll also want to make sure the light level is between 5-10 for this particular cross breeding to occur. Honestly, it's the worst, condition-wise.%n%nReally though, once you get to MV it's better to make a Glowstone crop and centrifuge it for redstone. Or a redstone block crop. Or just mine it, honestly. Red wheat == Dead wheat.

# Quest: Turning Dirt into proper Soil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAQ.name=Turning Dirt into proper Soil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAQ.desc=With an Assembler and some Seed Oil, you can turn Dirt and Sand into Garden Soil. This optimal Soil does not require nearby water, and Crops won't break when you fall on or run near it.%n%nHowever, unlike watered Farmland, it doesn't contribute to the humidity stat or speed up IC2 crops, so it's not useful for min-maxing.%n%nThe same goes for Enchanted Earth, the Lamp of Growth, Sprinklers, etc.

# Quest: Crop Stats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAg.name=Crop Stats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAg.desc=With the portable scanner, you can get the crop's stats and environmental info while it is still in the ground by right-clicking it. It also stays scanned after getting the seed. Look for the portable scanner quest after the EBF in Multiblock Goals. About those stats:%n%n§aGrowth§r:%nHow fast it grows, with higher = faster. Specifically, it increases the growth points your crop gets per growth tick. If it gets to 24+, your crop acts like a weed, so most people say to stay at 23 or less. However, it will only weed other crops under certain conditions.%n%n1) Is in a cardinal direction on the same Y level. 2) Will only affect dirt/grass, or cropsticks or crops 3) If there's a crop there that is §oalso§r a weed, if it's at a maturity level > 1, it §owon't affect it§r 4) If it affects the crop, it'll be replaced with a normal weed%n%n§9Gain§r:%nInfluences chances of how many drops you get, and whether you get any at all. 31 is the best for sure.%n%n§eResistance§r:%nThis stat is responsible for a couple of crops' properties: chances for getting a seed while punching crop, resistance of your crop to trampling (jumping on it), decreases chance of crop dying due to lack of environmental stats, and resistance of crop to weed spread. It also reduces mutation chance as it goes up (apparently). Aim for around 10 for balance.

# Quest: Metals From the Sky
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAw.name=Metals From the Sky
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAw.desc=You can even create metals not found on Earth using crops! You'll need the proper metal block beneath the crop in order for them to fully mature.%n%nBTW, higher tier crops have a lower chance of dropping seeds, so consider breeding a second one before you try breaking them, ok?

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHnw.desc=Need an infinite source of knightmetal? It will be a hard plant to grow. Make sure you provide plenty of nutrients, clean air, fertilizer and water. Don't cry to me if it dies. Any oreberry is a good source crop, with Cobalt and Ardite best, then iron and the rest.

# Quest: Do You Taste Metal?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI2A.name=Do You Taste Metal?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI2A.desc=Metal oreberries are a great source of new seeds. You can breed some or buy some from the Coins shop. I need some Copper myself, so give me some berries please.%n%nMetal oreberries require a block of that metal to fully mature, but you can harvest a reduced amount before then. Pretty much everything else that needs a block can't be harvested before maturity though. Look at the seedbag to see what it wants. You can also go to the wiki for the exact blocks. Usually, you can use an ore or metal block for those that have them.

# Quest: Deep Blue Sea of Sapphires

# Quest: Wax On, Wax Off
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJZQ.name=Wax On, Wax Off
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJZQ.desc=You can take vanilla tree saplings and place them directly on crop sticks. This will give you a "bonsai" tree. Bonsai trees will give you drops just like a tree, but without the wasted CPU of placing all the tree blocks just to chop them down again.%n%nThis can be significant overhead on a server, so if you want to be nice, breed some bonsai trees for your pyrolyze ovens. They also drop a ton and are fast, especially statted up, so there's no reason not to if you can automate them.

# Quest: Even More Stats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK0Q.name=Even More Stats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK0Q.desc=There are seven more stats to worry about too.%n%n§7Fertilizer§r, §9Water§r, and [warn]Weed-EX[/warn] are all about how much of these is on the crop stick rather than the crop itself. They're all about how much was applied, and is left of that.%n%n§2Nutrients§r, §1Humidity§r, and §6Air Quality§r are all about the environment. They're also affected by the Fertilizer and Water stats.%n%nNutrients and Humidity are mostly about the right biome, with swamp and rainforest types (hot+humid) being the best, but you can also get some extra stats by setting up right.%n%n§2Nutrients§r:%n3 possible free points from dirt under the farmland block, 2 for plants that require a specific block. So optimally always make sure that the required block is at the bottommost bottom in the column, because it checks in chain, not certain height. For example: cropstick -> farmland -> dirt -> oreblock -> dirt, it will only register 1 dirt, ignoring the one below the oreblock.%n%n5-10 possible points from fertilizing your crops. You can use fertilizer on a crop to increase its nutrient stat. Fertilizer caps at 199 which gives 10 nutrients, but can be applied again only if the crop drops below 100 fertilizer points. So for high stat crops it's safe to assume and make tests for 100 fertilizer points as it's a given constant unlike 199->100 values. You can apply bonemeal, IC2 fertilizer and Forestry fertilizer to a crop by hand. Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron does this automatically when supplied with fertilizer (the multifarm needs fertilizer to harvest crops as well).%n%n§1Humidity§r:%n2 free points from using dirt as farmland, as when farmland gets hydrated by water(turns darker) it gains 2 humidity points. This is why other blocks for this suck, since they don't give this bonus.%n%n10 possible points from hydrating your crop. Similar to fertilizing, water can be applied to crop up to 200 points, which is 10 humidity points, although unlike fertilizer it does not need to drop below value of 100, water can be applied over and over keeping it at constant 200 points. You can apply water to your crop by using IC2 hydration cells by hand, or let your Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron do it automatically. The multifarm needs water to harvest crops as well though.%n%n§6Air Quality§r:%n4 potential free points from empty space around crop. A crop checks for empty spaces to calculate bonus air quality points, it gives up to 4 points, 1 point for each 2 empty spaces. It only counts full blocks or cropsticks though. If you like looks, you'll probably have to sacrifice this.%n%n4 free points from height of your farm. You get 1 free point every 15 blocks startng at Y79.%n79 - 1 point%n94 - 2 points%n109 - 3 points%n124 - 4 points%n%n2 free points from no opaque blocks above the crop. You can place glass above and you won't lose the bonus since it's a transparent block. You cannot use dark glass, several layers of water, or gaseous tenebrae to get around this if your crop likes the dark. Unless you only let it grow at night I guess.%n%n§aGrowability§r:%nYour crop will require a certain level of NHA, try to reach or surpass this, or the crop will either not grow, or even die (disappear). Each crop is different, and higher tiers (and stats) require more. It's generally easy to meet though, as long as you're in a good biome.%n%nGrowability is determined by the difference between what the crop needs in terms of NHA, and what it actually has. If you have more than what you need it grows faster. This is why you don't want a maxed resistance stat, since higher stats will slow it down.

# Quest: Min-Maxing Crops
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK0g.name=Min-Maxing Crops
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK0g.desc=Breed stickreed until it's around 20/31/10, then create other crops with it, they inherit the stats. Crossbreeding with the ones you got on the way to raise their stats is also good.%n%nSet up camp in a swamp/jungle type biome around Y130, or use the biome changing methods to make one. This is way faster when breeding crops, not just growing them for drops.%n%nUse multifarms, always. You can use them together with the harvesters if you have super fast crops. Or just use more farms. Or add more gearboxes.%n%nDark glass is nice for oreberry crops.%n%nTo avoid weeding, checkerboard up and down on your multifarm. It may look stupid, but no weeds, Gr 23->31, and +2 AQ!%n%nUse fertilia to create more fertilizer.%n%nYou can replace mob farms with crops if you don't care about the other drops. Infernals drop special stuff though.%n%nUse WAs in TE mode to accelerate crops if you need it. Mostly useful for breeding, statting up, and for the primordial berry crop.%n%nAs you tier up, you can create 31/31/0 crops with the machines and UUM. It's up to you whether it's worth it though.%n%nGo do bees if you want something higher than EV tier materials.

# Quest: Barley Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKpQ.name=Barley Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKpQ.desc=It's time to plant some barley to make some bread. If you can't find wheat, barley is a good alternative source to make flour.

# Quest: Genetically Modifying Your Plants
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKqQ.name=Genetically Modifying Your Plants
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKqQ.desc=There are 3 machines crucial to doing this. You'll also need bucketloads of power, and the same (literally) of UUM.%n%nAll 3 can only work on crops up to a certain tier, determined by the tier of the machine you made and the crop you're working with. Basically, it's (crop tier+2)/2, rounded up. So an LV machine can work on T1 crops, but an MV one can work on T3.%n%n[note]LV=T1, MV=T3, HV=T5, EV=T7, IV=T9, LuV=T11, ZPM=T13, UV=T15, UHV=T17.[/note]%n%nFirst is the Crop Gene Extractor:%nIt takes an existing crop seedbag, an empty §2Data Orb§r (See EV quests), and §61A§r while running. Use a circuit to determine what stat to copy to the Data Orb. You'll probably want either 23-31-0, or 31-31-0 for max speed and output, since you won't be breeding from these. Remember to take proper precautions if going over 23, as they will attempt to weed everything around them. There's a significant number of crops, so you'll probably need a ton of Orbs too, unless you want to reuse them. [warn]Remember to keep a Data Orb or seedbag backup![/warn]%n%nSecond is the Crop Synthesizer:%nIt takes §24 Data Orbs§r, one for each of the types from the CGE, §51000L of UUM per crop tier/2§r (this is not rounded), and §616A§r while running. It will create a new crop seedbag with the desired stats.%n%nLastly is the Crop Replicator:%nIt takes an existing crop seedbag, §51000L per crop tier of UUM§r, and §66A§r while running. After finishing, it gives you back two of the same seedbag, duplicating it. This takes twice as much UUM, but less power, it's up to you whether that's worth it.

All storage spaces for items are the same, so don't bother making a ton of fridges unless you really want to. Supply water to the sink to get water for recipes.%n%nYou can store some cooking tools in the oven. You can store the rest on tool racks to auto-use them all in recipes. This includes stuff like the GT soft mallet if you can't make all the Pam's tools yet.%n%nThe oven has 3 input slots and 3 output slots, and can work on 9 items at once. It's basically a furnace. You can request items be cooked from the cooking table too.%n%nThe Cooking Table will automatically show you all recipes that can be created with the existing ingredients, and you can click on them to craft them. Make all the food, and get all the hearts!%n%nYou can use dye to color the kitchen, except for the oven.%n%nNote that the implementation is not finished, so there are some problems. Upgrades like powering the oven with RF/EU are not in yet. And so on. But we finally have a toaster so you can make TOAST!%n%nPlease report any bugs/problems to the CFB-specific GTNH issue tracker at [url]https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/CookingForBlockheads/issues[/url]%n%n[note]There is no cow in a jar, it will not come back.[/note]

# Quest: Electric Boat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACnw.name=Electric Boat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACnw.desc=The electric boat works mostly like a vanilla boat, chugging through the water at a decent pace. It will hopefully drop itself once you crash, which is slightly nicer than the usual sticks. That's all well and good, but what if we utilize the electric engine? Wearing an energy storage device in your chestplate slot, like a batpack or energypack, will cause the boat to drain energy from it and propel you forward at supersonic speed! Doing this will consume about 100 EU per block traveled, so even a decent batpack won't last long!

# Quest: Boat Shape?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACoA.name=Boat Shape?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACoA.desc=Really? Yes for the more advanced boats you need a new shape form.%n%nYou need to make an Extruder first to progress further.

# Quest: Crowbar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACpA.name=Crowbar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACpA.desc=The crowbar comes in a Railcraft (and thaumcraft versions of RC) and a gregtech variant. It is used to manipulate machines from railcraft, remove plates and any other covers (pumps, conveyor modules, etc.) from gregtech pipes and machines as well as breaking certain objects faster, such as tracks. This tool is also used to access certain inventories from Railcraft.%n%nHold a crowbar and shift-right-click to attach carts. Click the starting cart then continue to click to add more carts to the link. Carts will act slower the more connections are made.%n%nThe crowbar can be used as a weapon, though it costs twice as much durability on attack (just like any other non weapon tool...).

# Quest: Minecart
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACpQ.name=Minecart
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACpQ.desc=After you craft your first cart the journey can begin...%n%nWell, not really. You will need some kind of tracks first.%n%n[note]We here at QuestBook, Inc. do not guarantee the usefulness of minecarts or trains in any way. Especially since you can mine out a vein in a single session once you have a hammer and backpacks.[/note]%n%n[warn]WARNING: Unprotected carts can be knocked off their rails by lightning. Cover the area with blocks to prevent carts from disappearing.[/warn]%n%n[warn]Also, make sure to keep your cart in one chunk, or use chunkloaders covering the whole area the cart works within. Loading/unloading chunks may cause carts to disappear or duplicate.[/warn]%n%n[note]You should only make these if you want to have fun with them, as anything they can do is better done by other methods, including the Long Distance Fluid Pipeline. Excessive minecart and train use on servers may cause lag and you may be asked to switch later anyway.[/note]

# Quest: The Transcontinental Railroad
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADYg.name=The Transcontinental Railroad
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADYg.desc=All the different mining veins that have been found seem to be really far apart. One way to shorten the travel time is to create a railroad from your base to the different mines. Sadly this requires a large amount of both iron and creosote. Let's not forget to place the last symbolic rivet on one of your new train lines.

# Quest: Jetpack v.0.1 Alpha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADag.name=Jetpack v.0.1 Alpha

# Quest: Fluid Loader and Unloader
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEng.name=Fluid Loader and Unloader
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEng.desc=If you plan to automate the oil transport from your oil field far away, you need a fluid loader and unloader. A locking track will stop the train as long as oil is loaded or unloaded.%n%n[note]PS: You should probably use the Long Distance Fluid Pipeline once you can make it in LV unless you really love trains.[/note]%n%nFull details on how to use these may require online research (GTNH changes the recipes, not normal Railcraft functionality), but here is a simple list of things to do:%n%n1. Make a loop of track from your base to the oil well.%n2. Place a locking track near the well, and put a fluid loader two blocks above it. The track should be in Locking Mode - use a crowbar to change it.%n3. Use the tank car on the filter in the loader and set it to Immediate mode.%n4. Connect the well to the loader as normal.%n5. Put a fluid unloader under a locking track at your base, and set it the same as the loader.%n6.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIWg.desc=Nobody likes an untidy base. You can craft a spray can and later fill it with Chemical Dye made from sulfuric acid to color coordinate your carpets, cables, wires, and machines. But for now, have a couple of freebies.

# Quest: Carpenter's Blocks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIcA.name=Carpenter's Blocks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIcA.desc=Yet another custom block system! Carpenter's blocks are crafted blank and placed in-world, and then plain block textures applied to them. The blocks must not be Tile Entities, so Botany blocks don't work correctly with them, but GT Stones like Red Granite, and any colored clay or vanilla glass block will work. Some Chisel glass types will work, and Ztones blocks and Tinted Glass also work.%n%nThe Garage Door requires a block at the top to hang "down" from, but can pretty much be any length. A redstone signal on any block next to the Garage Door blocks will open or close the door. The open/close will propagate across multiple vertical doors, so you can set up non-square doors. Sneaking and right-clicking with an empty hand will change the door's polarity.%n%nThe pressure plates are player-only activation, making them great for doors into your base.%n%nThe hatches must be clicked on the side of a block to place. They can be handy for protecting you from crucible...byproducts.%n%nThere is a lot more block shapes possible, check NEI for "Carpenter's" to see the options.%n%nThe Chisel allows you to chisel blocks while attached to a Carpenter's block.%n%nThe Hammer allows various functions.%n%nHammer on door - changes door shape type%nSneak Hammer on door - Changes from iron to wooden behavior%nSneak Hammer on lever - Changes polarity (which direction is on/off)

# Quest: Catwalks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM3g.name=Catwalks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM3g.desc=The Catwalks Mod adds several cosmetic blocks to deck out your factory.%n%nScaffolds and Builder's Scaffolds are useful for building up in the air before you get access to flight. They can be climbed like ladders, and break instantly when punched. You will also not fall off of them if you let go of movement keys while climbing. If you right-click the Builder's Scaffold with a solid block, the scaffold will be replaced by that block.%n%nCatwalks can connect to each other to form a wide passageway. You can decorate them by attaching Caution Tape or Rope Lights, the latter provide dim lighting.%n%nCaged Ladders give you a way to move up and down without a risk of falling off. Climbing them is much faster than vanilla ladders.%n%nSupport Columns are purely decorative. They connect to each other in all directions. They also work as ladders.%n%nSturdy Rails let you run minecart tracks across gaps without supports. Right-click the Sturdy Powered Rail with a Blowtorch to power it permanently, you don't need a redstone torch. If you don't have enough distractions already, use them to build a rollercoaster!%n%nThe Blowtorch lets you remove railings or even the floor from a catwalk by right-clicking. Use it to make an opening to let you walk onto the catwalk, or if you don't know what an "OSHA violation" is. The same function can be performed by a GT or Forge-compatible wrench, so you don't actually need to make this.

# Quest: Obsidian Chest

# Quest: Forestry Core Block
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQQ.name=Forestry Core Block
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQQ.desc=This sturdy casing is the basis for almost all machines in Forestry, essentially being the Forestry equivalent of a machine casing.

# Quest: The Carpenter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQg.name=The Carpenter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQg.desc=The carpenter is similar to an automatic crafting table. It has an item input slot and a storage slot for the recipes. Some recipes need an additional fluid like water, creosote, honey or molten redstone. With the carpenter you can make farmblocks, woven backpacks, bee and tree analyzers and many more.%n%nThe carpenter needs power to work. You can use a GT cable or a battery box to connect to the machine or make some forestry, railcraft or buildcraft RF engines.%n%n[note]PS: Yes it's a pain in the ass to automate, just make one for each thing you want to make.[/note]

# Quest: Thermionic Fabricator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRA.name=Thermionic Fabricator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRA.desc=The thermionic fabricator is used to craft electron tubes and stained glass. It requires redstone flux (RF) energy to run.%n%nIt is your first machine made in the carpenter. Once warmed up, it needs to maintain a certain heat level to operate. The amount of power supplied will determine how much heat will be generated. If you do not supply enough power to maintain the current temperature it will slowly drop. It will continuously draw power, so disconnect it if you don't need it.

# Quest: A Series of Tubes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRQ.name=A Series of Tubes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRQ.desc=Before you can craft your first farm block you need apatite tubes. Make some apatite rods first with a lathe, then use a forge hammer to join them into long apatite rods. You need golden bolts and a red alloy plate.%n%nPut some glass or sand into your thermionic fabricator and make your first tubes.%n%n[note]You can also use the circuit assembler for a better output. Why did we have you make the TF again?[/note]

# Quest: The Multifarm
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRg.name=The Multifarm
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRg.desc=The smallest farm you can build requires 36 farm blocks (3x4x3 - the largest is 5x4x5 or 100 farm blocks). Place the underlying blocks corresponding to the farm type you built. In this case, Stone Bricks. You can place these blocks beside or under the multi structure, but not the layer above. It will search 6 blocks above these for dirt/farmland/sand/soul sand/humus depending on farm type, with the appropriate crops, saplings, etc. on top of that.%n%nYou can use different modes to collect different crops. Arboretum for trees, infernal for nether wart and so on. You can even mix and match modes on the same farm - cutting trees down for wood in part, and collecting fruit from trees without destroying it in another, for example. So long as they're on different sides, at least.%n%nYou may need to experiment a bit to see what works, but [url]https://ftbwiki.org/MultiFarm#Managed_Farms[/url] has a decent list, though it doesn't specify cotton for managed crop farms for example. It might be a GTNH change, I dunno. A number of crops have an added IC2 crop version as well, so you may prefer those for the higher yield if you level them up. Orchard mode works with Pam's, and Witchery, just to save you some time. Pam's nether crops however don't seem to work at all though.

# Quest: Farm Logic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRw.name=Farm Logic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRw.desc=This chip allows you to select the farm type (when combined with the right electron tubes), and not use the default of growing trees. Unless that's what you want, in which case you don't need it.%n%nFor each circuit tier, you can configure 1/4 more of your farm.

# Quest: Changing Your Foresty Circuit Configuration
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACSA.name=Changing Your Foresty Circuit Configuration
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACSA.desc=The (forestry) soldering iron is a tool used for attaching electron tubes to circuit boards in order to manipulate how an electrical engine works or to program multifarms, as well as upgrading the squeezer or centrifuge. Honestly, you'll probably only use it for the multifarm though.%n%nOnce electron tubes have been attached to a circuit board they cannot be removed, only replaced. The circuit board is automatically crafted as soon as the basic recipe requirements are met, so it's best practice to first place your electron tubes and then add the circuit board.%n%nThe soldering iron can also be used to remove the circuit board from electrical engines, multifarms, squeezers and centrifuges by opening the machine's GUI and left-clicking with the soldering iron on the circuit board slot.

# Quest: Heating Coils
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACSQ.name=Heating Coils
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACSQ.desc=Your thermionic fabricator needs heating coils to function. So combine some magnetized (requires polarizer) steel rods with some copper wire and make some.%n%n[note]Why is this a separate quest again?[/note]

# Quest: Finding Apatite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTA.name=Finding Apatite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTA.desc=It's now time to search for some ores. Apatite is the most important material in Forestry. You can make fertilizer, farm blocks and other things with it. The vein is found between Y 40-60.

# Quest: Multifarm: Hatch
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTQ.name=Multifarm: Hatch
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTQ.desc=You can supply and extract items from the farm by using farm hatches that are connected to pipe systems.%n%nSupplying items%nThe farm hatch is clever enough to know which item goes where. If an item isn't appropriate for the farm's configuration, the hatch will simply reject it.%n%nExtracting items%nAny item that is harvested by the Multifarm is automatically ejected by the farm hatches into inventories or pipes. Pipes can be used to extract from other sides. You may need more than one, or a better conveyor if it isn't extracting fast enough for you.

# Quest: Multifarm: Valve
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTg.name=Multifarm: Valve
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTg.desc=Most farms require water for hydration purposes. Although you can do it manually by supplying it through liquid containers (such as cans), you can also automate the process by using farm valves.%n%nBy connecting fluid pipes into the farm valve and supplying water, you can automatically fill the farm's water tank.%n%nIf it hasn't rained for a while, the required water will go up, up to 1500%%. Use an Everfull Urn, or Reservoir (RIO) for serious water needs.

# Quest: Multifarm: Control
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTw.name=Multifarm: Control
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTw.desc=You can control which fields of your farm work by applying a redstone signal to the control block. You can either shut down the whole farm by applying a redstone signal from top or below or you can disable a specific side by applying a redstone signal on the matching side of the control block.

# Quest: Multifarm: Gearbox
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACUA.name=Multifarm: Gearbox
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACUA.desc=To power your farm and have it automatically harvest crops, you will need at least one farm gearbox to supply power. You can use either RF or EU. If you use EU, make sure to use a cable to allow conversion. Farm operations can be hastened with additional gearboxes.%n%nTesting has shown that splitting the amps to 4 gearboxes (4A ULV) works better than sending 1A LV to 4 gearboxes.%n%nA max sized IC2 Crop farm (5x4x5) using all space possible with max stat seeds (31/31/0) on a fast crop needs only 6A ULV to keep up.%n%nSimilarly, a max sized small farm (3x4x3) using all space possible with max stat seeds (31/31/0) on a high tier, moderate speed crop needs only 4A ULV.%n%nSending more power to the same gearbox doesn't work. If it can get to max RF capacity but your farm can't keep up, sending more power won't help, so add more gearboxes.%n%nIn addition, you lose 2 EU from the energy emitting device for every Amp of ULV (which is only 8 to begin with), so it's not nearly as efficient as using LV or higher. Just keep in mind that more A to more gearboxes is better than to the same one.%n%nOf course, if you mix your slower crops with your faster ones, you aren't likely to need to min-max to this extent.

# Quest: Enhanced Farm Logic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACUQ.name=Enhanced Farm Logic

# Quest: The Centrifuge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4g.name=The Centrifuge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4g.desc=The Forestry Centrifuge is able to centrifuge up to 9 items out of bee combs. It uses RF energy.%n%nLatter bee combs need the GT one though, so keep that in mind.

# Quest: Clockwork Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEvg.name=Clockwork Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEvg.desc=Producing RF Power by hand is a good idea for making one or two recipes in the Forestry machines. The turrets can be charged with it too.

# Quest: Bio Gas Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEvw.name=Bio Gas Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEvw.desc=Producing RF power with lava is possible with the help of the biogas engine. You need water, fruit juice, liquid honey, milk, seed oil, or forestry biomass in the other slot. After a brief warmup time, the engine outputs up to 50 RF/t depending on the fluid used.%n%nThe possible fluids give the following power:%n%nWater: 10 RF/t for 1k ticks%nFruit juice: 10 RF/t for 2.5k ticks%nLiquid honey: 20 RF/t for 2.5k ticks%nMilk: 10 RF/t for 10k ticks%nSeed oil: 30 RF/t for 2.5k ticks%nBiomass: 50 RF/t for 2.5k ticks

# Quest: Peat Fired Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEwA.name=Peat Fired Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEwA.desc=Peat fired engines use Peat or Bituminous Peat to run. Peat burns for 5000 ticks and produces 10 RF every tick, 1 peat makes 0.66 Ash, so you get 2 Ash for burning 3 peat. Bituminous Peat burns for 6000 ticks and produces 20 RF/tick.%n%nPeat Farms can be set up by using a managed farm with tin electron tubes. It is possible with a manual farm too.

# Quest: Copper, Tin, Bronze Tubes

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI1w.desc=If you're tired of constantly replacing branchcutters, this Industrial Grafter is rechargeable.%n%n[note]Or you could just make better ones.[/note]

# Quest: Another Path to Ethanol
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIAw.name=Another Path to Ethanol
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIAw.desc=Using a fermenter with excess saplings or other garbage will give you Forestry biomass. Higher Sappiness trait on your trees will get you better results.

# Quest: Why No, This is Not Fit For Human Consumption
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBA.name=Why No, This is Not Fit For Human Consumption
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBA.desc=Taking the biomass from the Fermenter and using it in a still will give you Ethanol. Not really worth it for power, but useful if you want to turn it into ethylene. You could set it up on an old steam setup with nothing better to do to get a more useful power source out of it, or use the Ethanol to power the setup and the forestry farm.

# Quest: Better Fermenter Outputs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBw.name=Better Fermenter Outputs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBw.desc=With a Squeezer you can boost the output from your fermenter, saving on Fertilzer or Mulch and getting more per sapling. There's a variety of crops you can use to make fruit juice, so have fun breeding.

# Quest: Such Pretty Leaves...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIw.name=Such Pretty Leaves...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIw.desc=Now that you have entered MV you can begin breeding Forestry trees the smart way. Start by getting a Treealyzer, and scan the vanilla trees. They will transform into the forestry versions. You will need to gather honey or honeydew drops from bee combs to power the Treealyzer.%n%nIf you want to bulk scan saplings, you can feed them through a GT scanner filled with honey.%n%nYou can also try the Genetics mod to modify them. It's on the first bee tab.

# Quest: Collecting the Hybrids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIJA.name=Collecting the Hybrids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIJA.desc=If you got lucky and found some bees in a village, put them in their houses next to some trees. Over time the bees will slowly pollinate the leaves of the trees. Using a grafter you can break the leaf blocks to retrieve a sapling 100%%, useful for getting the forestry saplings. This doesn't seem to work with magical trees though. You can trade with villagers to get proven grafters that have a longer lifetime. Also investigate magic, you have heard rumors of long lasting grafters available to magicians.%n%nGregTech also offers a really nice tool, the Branch Cutter.

# Quest: Seeing the Fruits of Your Labor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIJQ.name=Seeing the Fruits of Your Labor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIJQ.desc=It can be difficult to see which leafy blocks are pollinated. Craft a pair of spectacles to get a better view.

# Quest: Orchard Apple
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINQ.name=Orchard Apple
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINQ.desc=The Orchard Apple tree has a couple of nice traits. The Faster maturity trait means it will turn from sapling to tree quickly.

# Quest: Speak For the Trees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAISg.name=Speak For the Trees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAISg.desc=You'll need to find a bunch of vanilla trees to start your breeding program. To convert them directly to Forestry trees, you can use a Treealyzer - but you'll need a carpenter and aluminium from MV for that. Alternatively, you can just grow a bunch of vanilla trees and surround them by good pollination bees in bee housing. Spectacles will help you see the fertilized leaves to harvest with your Grafter or Branch Cutter.%n%nCompleting the quests will require scanned trees, but you can progress on breeding while waiting for your GT Scanner or Treealyzer to be made.

# Quest: Silver Lime
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAITA.name=Silver Lime
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAITA.desc=Silver Lime, a basic tree breed. Breed it by mating Silver Birch with Apple Oak.%n%nNote: For all tree breeding quests, the required tree must be a pure species, not a hybrid, and must be scanned.

# Quest: U-238 Tu-Wait, Seriously?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK0w.name=U-238 Tu-Wait, Seriously?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK0w.desc=If you want IC2 crops to work with the multifarm, you now need this. Get the U-238 from thorium, and the endereyes from either your crops, villagers, or the normal way in HV. It also only searches 6 blocks above the farm structure block to prevent lag. So goodbye MF stacking, you always looked dumb, and didn't make any sense.%n%nThe largest size supports ~1100 crops, while the smallest supports ~600 depending on your layout if you use it for IC2 crops. This is because it will look for crops up to 5 blocks out further than normal in this mode (In the cardinal directions, it's further out in the corners. Just try it out, it's hard to describe). They're the same size as in previous versions, so you don't need to rejigger them.

# Quest: BEGONE, LAG! Also, Bats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK1A.name=BEGONE, LAG! Also, Bats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK1A.desc=Lag = Butterflies in this case, since they like to pile up just outside of chunk loading range. Also, they're annoying since they convert regular trees into more forestry ones, one leaf block at a time. Which causes more of the buggers to spawn. Fortunately, the settings we use prevent too many from being present at once, but still, they're annoying.%n%nThe solution to this is to kill them. Also, the bats. Stupid Thaumcraft warp. Use the (potentially unfinished) Pest Killer to do so.%n%nNotes: Hydrogen Cyanide has a recipe now. Both it and Formaldehyde require a Chemical Plant. It doesn't appear to use any of the Formaldehyde up though. The range is apparently 5x5 chunks, not blocks. It also only runs once every 30s or so?%n%n[note]PS: If you experience problems using it (more than already mentioned), raise a ticket on GitHub.[/note]

betterquesting.quest.9Pc7p99ASnybsIbWmmg0LQ.desc=Finally, to actually get some ICs, use your photons in a Target Chamber.%n%nNote that the EU/t value listed in TC recipes is only a minimum, as recipe time is entirely determined by the Amount of photons you give the multi.%n%nMore specifically, you can get the recipe time by dividing recipe Amount by your input beam Amount, then multiplying that by 5s.

# Quest: Multiblock Tanks... Railcraft Tanks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALQ.name=§6§lMultiblock Tanks... Railcraft Tanks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALQ.desc=576 buckets of fluid, that should be enough to store all the creosote you have accumulated thus far. If that isn't enough you can make this tank bigger. The smallest tanks are 3x4x3 while the biggest are 9x8x9.%n%nFluid will auto-output without any pumps if you place a valve on its bottom side at the center. The output rate is 1000 L/t so twice as fast as a GT HV Pump Cover. You can color the tank with Buildcraft paintbrushes and the GT spray can.%n%nIf you still use Railcraft tanks in later tiers, you boost the output rate by using pumps.

# Quest: The Water Dilemma
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASw.name=§6§lThe Water Dilemma
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASw.desc=Finite water is a problem. But fear not, there are solutions! I shall guide you to a steady supply of water. The Railcraft water siding tanks provides enough water to last the early game.%n%nThe humidity of a biome is very important and will increase the base fill rate. If it is raining, the tank will fill much quicker. One block of the water siding tank must see sky for the maximum output. The best part is that you don't need a pump to extract water. Tanks and pipes placed next to it will be autofilled by the water siding tank.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATQ.name=§r§6§l§5§l§o§l§r§6§lEBF-Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATQ.desc=In order to get aluminium ingots, you need an Electric Blast Furnace. It's another very important step towards victory, so let's get started.%n%nGetting the Mica for the heating coils might be a little tricky, but you can use a substitute for the first tier of coils.%nYou need 2 LV hatches with 4A of 32V total, or 3 LV hatches with MOOOORE power if the multiblock is not fully repaired.%nIn order to not scrape by for Nickel, check out the quest Source of Nickel in the Novice Thaumaturgy tab.%n%n§rA few recipes produce CO2/SO2 as a fluid. This fluid can be collected by placing a fluid output hatch on the top layer of the EBF. You could also enable fluid voiding in the EBF controller block GUI. For recipes with such a C02/S02 output you must do one or the other or the EBF will not start.%nThe amount of fluid recovered depends on the tier of the muffler hatch.%n%nBart's Platinum Series recipes output fluids on the BOTTOM and are NOT affected by the muffler hatch tier, so if you want to do Platinum Stuff later, remember that.%n%nMoron always says - Make Muffler Moint Mup. Or point up, anyways. Before the launch, don't forget to fix maintenance issues and put a programmed circuit if necessary.%n%nIf you want a really fancy EBF, you can add more input fluid hatches and store different fluids in each one.%n%nThe EBF also has a heat adjustment of 100K for each power tier above or below MV. You can only make LV energy hatches right now, but installing two LV energy hatches will overclock the EBF to MV power, eliminating the 100K penalty and setting the initial heat to 1801K.%n%nAs you upgrade your EBF over the course of the game, this heat adjustment will increase. Two MV energy hatches (overclocking to HV) will add +100K, two HV energy hatches (overclocking to EV) will give +200K, and so on. Coils only set the base value. This adjustment does not apply to the Volcanus.%n%nIf the pollution gets really bad, check in GT++ Multiblocks for a pollution scrubber, or upgrade your Muffler.

# Quest: More Heat - Kanthal Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATg.name=§6§lMore Heat - Kanthal Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATg.desc=Better materials need higher temperatures. You can just exchange the old coils with the new ones. Kanthal coils let you reach 2700K. You can even reuse the old coils in your Pyro or to make other machines, how fancy is that! If you don't have any other place to use them, you can macerate or arc furnace them too.%n%nIf you don't have a Vacuum Freezer yet, then cool the hot ingots in an MV Chemical Bath with Coolant.%n%nRemember that you can get an upgraded OC (4/4) instead of a regular one (4/2) if your coils are 1800K above the recipe temperature, as well as an EU discount. This applies to every 900K or 1800K above, so you should try to upgrade your coils as soon as you can.

Therefore, we present you the vacuum freezer. It should be good enough to cool your hot stuff.%n%nIngots that go through the EBF above a certain temperature will come out as hot ingots that need to be cooled.%n%nYou will need a minimum of 16 frost proof machine casings, the rest depends on your setup.

# Quest: An Unexpected Bonus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUg.name=§7§6§lAn Unexpected Bonus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUg.desc=Because we're nice developers, we decided to add a little bonus if you happen to compress charcoal. Use it in the bricked blast furnace, or in a boiler, it yields 10 times the burn time of a piece of charcoal. So one charcoal for free. This bonus only occurs on the first compression step. (But for fanciness, you should definitely get a quintuple one!)%n%n[note]Of course they're kinda useless unless you're using BBFs or boilers, though you can use them to make industrial diamonds.[/note]

# Quest: High-Speed Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUw.name=§6§lHigh-Speed Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUw.desc=Sure, those coke ovens are nice, but they aren't even remotely fast enough to keep up with a large steam boiler.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABdQ.desc=§6§lExtreme Entity Crusher§r is your new and probably the §lbest§r spawner/grinder, with this you are not only able to get drops without any §lTPS§r issues but also with style and §lextreme§r efficiency.%n%nOf course that depends on the quality of your sword, damage and looting are the only stats that matter (weapon is optional since structure requires spikes and if you want to use it, put it into the dedicated slot in controller).%n%nIf normal drops aren't your thing then you can build blood magic ritual "Well of Suffering" on top of the multiblock (you still get items but at a very slow rate).%nAlso generates liquid xp (always 120L) and can spawn infernal mobs if possible (uses x8 power with every infernal spawn so you need to take into account that energy usage will spike once in a while so be prepared for that!).%n%n§lNotes:§r%nIn case of any problems with multiblock animation just use soldering iron on the machine to disable it.

# Quest: Powderbarrels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-Q.name=§6§lPowderbarrels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-Q.desc=Powderbarrels are pretty bad in the implosion compressor. They are good for prospecting though. Craft one stack.

# Quest: TNT
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-g.name=§6§lTNT
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-g.desc=TNT is much more powerful than the powderbarrel but much harder to craft. There are LV and HV ways to craft. At LV you need heavy or light fuel to make some toluene which can be solidified to gelled toluene. Alternatively you can use sugar and plastic dust in a chemical reactor to make toluene more efficiently. Mix it with sulfuric acid to make TNT.%n%nThe HV petrol way requires an oil cracking unit to make all kinds of cracked fuel or cracked naphta and a distillation tower to extract toluene from that.%nThough you can also go the wood tar route in mid-MV.

# Quest: iTNT
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-w.name=§6§liTNT
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-w.desc=Industrial TNT is the HV variant of TNT. It explodes with more power, and you can't pick it up. Not by hand anyway

# Quest: Better Than Duct Tape
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC8w.name=§6§lBetter Than Duct Tape
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC8w.desc=Using a soldering iron tool to remove the "burned out circuits" message is cheaper than duct tape.%n%nThe soldering iron requires one soldering material item and 10,000 EU. Valid soldering materials are fine wires, rods, and ingots made from either tin, lead, or soldering alloy. The soldering iron will consume the first such material it finds in the player's inventory. Since you'll likely have more than enough, Fine Wires of Soldering Alloy are probably best.%n%nYou can also use it to adjust the redstone strength from weak to strong emitted by GT machines.%n%nAlso, while holding it all pipes, wires, and cables will look very small, so that you can see everything past them, and also be sure of the exact connections.%n%nIn order to "complete" the quest you'll need to charge the soldering iron after you craft it.%n%nFor the other problems other tools are necessary. Keep in mind that you can put all needed tools in a toolbox to fix all problems in one click.%n%nPossible problems                Tool to fix%n"Pipe is loose."

# Quest: Low-Pressure Boiler Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACLw.name=§6§lLow-Pressure Boiler Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACLw.desc=The low pressure boiler tank is the easiest way to make steam with an RC boiler. The firebox needs this tank on top to produce steam. The bigger the boiler the slower it heats up, but it will produce more steam when heated up.%n%nExtract steam by attaching a pipe to the boiler tank.%n%n[note]This variant is very useful for inconsistent operation. It has lower efficiency but heats up significantly faster than the high pressure variant meaning the fuel will be used more efficiently at the beginning of the operation, the drawback is that this variant is 50%% as efficient as the high pressure one is at max temperature. If instead you want to have a constant high-throughput steam generation use high pressure variant instead.[/note]%n%n[warn]Actual fuel usage depends on the machine size and other factors such as machine temperature, if you want to know the actual number you will need to test it on your own setup.[/warn]

# Quest: Railcraft Steam Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMA.name=§6§lRailcraft Steam Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMA.desc=As an alternative way to make steam you can use the railcraft boilers. They require at least one firebox.%n%nMore than one size is possible: (1x1 which the quest gets you to make) 2x2 and 3x3.%n%nProvide water and coal to the firebox. Make sure you don't run out of water or...BOOM.%n%nEach boiler needs 1, 2 or 3 layers of tanks on top, equal to the size (1x1x1, 2x2x2, or 3x3x3) - see the quests linked below.

# Quest: Liquid-Fuelled Firebox
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMQ.name=§6§lLiquid-Fuelled Firebox
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMQ.desc=Cresosote oil into steam! After you make your first steel you are able to craft a liquid fueled firebox.%n%nDiesel, ethanol, creosote and bio diesel all work well here. This will also require a boiler tank - see the quests linked below.

# Quest: High-Pressure Boiler Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMg.name=§6§lHigh-Pressure Boiler Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMg.desc=After you make steel you are able to craft a high pressure boiler tank. The upgraded version increases the temperature and produces more steam than the low pressure version. It will take longer to warm up, so make sure to keep it well fed!%n%nExtract steam by attaching a pipe to the boiler tank.%n%n[note]This is better than the low pressure variant only if you keep it working for very long time, if you intend to turn it on and off all the time this will waste a lot of resources! If you keep it at top temperature it will use ~2x more fuel than low pressure and will give ~4x more steam per sec making it 100%% more efficient! If you can't sustain the fuel drain or want a more flexible power source instead use the low pressure variant.[/note]%n%n[warn]Actual fuel usage depends on the machine size and other factors such as machine temperature, if you want to know the actual number you will need to test it on your own setup.[/warn]

# Quest: Dynamite

# Quest: Time to Drill for Oil!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_Q.name=§6§lTime to Drill for Oil!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_Q.desc=Pumps are nice but you're going to reach a point where you'll want MOOOOOOOOOOOOORE oil. This multiblock will help with that but you'll need to search for oil using a seismic prospector. You can find raw, light, medium, and heavy oil. There's also a chance to find natural gas.%n%nHigher tiers of power will drill faster. You need to upgrade the energy hatch corresponding to the power tier.%n%nLater you can upgrade the oil drilling rig so it extracts from more than one chunk at a time.%n%nYou need mining pipes in the controller. If you need more than 64, you can use an input bus.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on any side. And set a waypoint with JourneyMaps so you don't forget where you placed it!%n%nSpace dims can also have fluids beneath bedrock. For info, check the Tips and Tricks tab.

# Quest: Let's Get Crackin!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_g.name=§6§lLet's Get Crackin!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_g.desc=Cracking oil products like light and heavy fuel with the oil cracker is faster and more efficient than using a chemical reactor, producing 25 to 50 percent more output, depending on which cracking method it's doing (steam does 50%%, hydro does 25%% but consumes 20%% less hydrogen). Cracked products will result in additional by-products in the distillation tower. It is a smart idea to get this multiblock since you are going to need TONS of industrial TNT from Toluene for advanced tier rockets.%n%nThe 16 coils form 2 vertical rings of 8 on either side of the controller. The casings between the rings can be replaced with a hatch for steam/hydrogen input. Energy hatch and maintenance hatch can replace any of the casings. The input product hatch and output product hatch must replace one of the casings outside of the coils.%n%nHint: Only GT/Railcraft steam can be used, not ic2 steam. You can use a fluid heater to make it instead of a boiler.%n%n[note]The circuit goes in the controller.[/note]%n%n[note]PS: I listed all the cracker recipes on the spreadsheet for you to look at in a convenient format. Now you can easily compare which oil path to take![/note]

# Quest: Automation, Tier 1
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACtw.name=§6§lAutomation, Tier 1
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACtw.desc=Do you want to automate your smeltery because you're planning to make stacks and stacks of glass blocks?%n%nNo problem, craft a large bronze pipe and place it under the faucet. Make sure to connect the pipe to the faucet using a wrench. Now the molten fluid will flow inside the pipe. Under or next to the pipe you have to place the casting basins or tables.%n%nA hopper and a chest underneath will auto-output products from the casting blocks.%n%nNOTE: Faucets will output precisely 144L each activation if you toggle it off immediately. That's going to have some uses later on...

# Quest: Automation, Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACuA.name=§6§lAutomation, Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACuA.desc=You want a better automation than using pipes? Sure, craft a comparator and link it with redstone dust placed on the ground. The redstone needs to be adjacent to the faucet to activate the crafting process.

# Quest: 2x Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACuQ.name=§6§l2x Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACuQ.desc=Steel production is so slow. If you got enough bricks and clay, build a second BBF. Build it attached to the first one, so they can share a wall and you will save some bricks, clay and concrete.%n%n[warn]Note that this will generate twice as much pollution in total - consider moving them further away.[/warn]

# Quest: 4x Steel

# Quest: Why One Coke Oven When You Can Have Ten?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACuw.name=§6§lWhy One Coke Oven When You Can Have Ten?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACuw.desc=Your bricked blast furnace uses coal like hell and your steam boilers do too? Well it's time to make more coke ovens and automate them a bit. Wooden fluid pipes and tin item pipes will help you reach your goal. You can use either faucets with redstone clocks or LV pumps to empty the creosote. For the charcoal, hoppers are easy to get once you have an assembler.%n%nUnlike GregTech multiblocks, coke ovens must have 1 space separating each oven.%n%nSearch NEI for a more efficient way to make coke oven bricks.%n%nRemember that tin item pipes require a steel wrench to dismantle them.%n%nThe whole coke-oven process generates a lot of pollution, so consider putting it further away.

# Quest: Still Not Enough Charcoal?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDQ.name=§6§lStill Not Enough Charcoal?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDQ.desc=This oven is the best way to get charcoal and creosote (x50 faster than Railcraft's coke oven) and other byproducts. You will need tons of bronze, iron and steel to build it, but it's worth it. Finally, it will be possible to dismantle the charcoal pit.%n%nWith Cupronickel coils the oven is a bit slower. Each coil tier speeds up the charcoal production.

# Quest: It's Time to Get More Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEA.name=§6§lIt's Time to Get More Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEA.desc=As soon as you have the ability to store energy in large quantities, it would be necessary to have a way to generate energy in large quantities. You need a large bronze boiler. But in order to make this boiler, you will need a mountain of bronze. This boiler produces 800L of steam per tick. This is enough to run 10 basic steam turbines.%n%nThe large boiler can use either water or distilled water. Water is consumed at a rate of 1L of water per 150L of steam.%n%nTo make a large boiler you must make a 3x3x5 structure with Bronze Pipe Casings in the center of the middle 3 levels. The lowest level must contain at least 1 or 2 input hatches, 1 or 2 input buses, 3 or 4 fireboxes, 1 muffler, and one maintenance hatch. The lowest level can not contain any plated bricks. All hatches, buses, and mufflers must have their back side touching a firebox. The output hatch can be placed on any of the upper 4 levels.%n%n§c§cWarning: Different from other boilers, Large Boilers must contain water at all times while active. If at any point the Boiler runs out of water while it is active, it will explode.

# Quest: Steam is Never Enough
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEg.name=§6§lSteam is Never Enough
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEg.desc=Now you can make Advanced Circuits, which means it's time to build a Large Steel Boiler. Each one of these produces 1000 EU/t in Steam, which means you will need several Steam Turbines to convert it all to power! Keep in mind that the MV ones are less efficient, so calculate your losses when building your setup.

# Quest: Moooooore Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEw.name=§6§lMoooooore Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEw.desc=The Titanium Large Boiler is a distant cousin to the Bronze and Steel Boilers, and it has a significant difference. Instead of accepting just about any burnable fuel, it will only accept specific ones and reject all others. You can see which ones are accepted by looking at the appropriate NEI tab, but the Solid Super Fuels are guaranteed to work.%n%nThis is a big downside, but the upside is that these boilers output respectable power even in these tiers. Without any other inputs, this boiler produces Superheated Steam at a flow rate matching 4000 EU/t, on turbines running at 100%% fuel efficiency. If this becomes 150%%, then the steam output will produce 6000 EU/t, almost the same as a boosted Large Combustion Engine!%n%nTo get all the power from this, though, you will need an HP Steam Turbine, followed by a regular Steam Turbine, or more than one of each if the flow rate is too big for the turbine material you've chosen. Make sure to send the Distilled Water back to the boilers!

# Quest: Even More Steam? Are You Sure?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADFA.name=§6§lEven More Steam? Are You Sure?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADFA.desc=The Large Tungstensteel Boiler is the biggest and baddest of the four. Like the Titanium one, it is a specialized boiler that only accepts specific fuels, mainly the Solid Super Fuels, but it will produce Superheated Steam at a rate equivalent to 16000 EU/t, at 100%% fuel efficiency. If you have good Steam Turbines, especially Oriharukon ones, you will get much more power than that, around 24000 EU/t or more.%n%nDepending on how many of these you build, you might need a huge amount of turbines. To solve that problem, consider going a bit above the optimal flow on each turbine, or even switching to Loose mode, although this is only a good choice if you can match the optimal flow in that mode.

# Quest: Smelt All the Things...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADZg.name=§6§lSmelt All the Things...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADZg.desc=Smelting up to nine items at once sound nice? With a bit of steel you can make a railcraft Steam Oven. 2x2x2%n%nHint: All furnace recipes work just fine, but you cannot use it to make charcoal from wood.

# Quest: Cleanroom
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADrA.name=§6§lCleanroom
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADrA.desc=If you want to make more advanced (and cheaper!) circuits, you will need a Cleanroom. The Cleanroom is an interesting multiblock, because you will be placing other machines §oinside§r of the room!%n%nThe cleanroom is a hollow multiblock between 3x4x3 and 15x15x15 (WxHxL) blocks. The base does not need to be a square; a rectangular shape is fine. The top layer is built out of Filter Machine Casings, except for the edges, which are Plascrete Blocks. The controller needs to be in the center of the top layer. If the width or length of the room are even, then it can be any one of the two (or four) middle blocks. The rest of the structure is built out of Plascrete Blocks.%n%nUp to 30%% of those Plascrete Blocks can be replaced by other valid blocks or materials:%n%nA Reinforced Door lets you get in and out of the cleanroom. Make sure to keep the doors closed, or the cleanroom will rapidly lose efficiency. Travel Anchors and Elevators also work, you can even embed them in the floor if you want to.%n%nIn order to automate power and item transport through the walls, you can use Cable Diodes or Machine Hulls. Just be really careful when upgrading your machines to a higher voltage. Be sure to remove the machine hulls and diodes and replace them with the new power tier, or else you will be very sad. You don't need to do this for ones you only use to pass items through.%n%nIf you want to see inside, you can use any EV+ tier glass (for example, Reinforced Glass or Managlass). If the Cleanroom does not form, mind the 30%% limit: often the problem is that you added too much glass.%n%nFinally, the Cleanroom itself will need a Maintenance and Energy Hatch to run. The power usage of this multiblock is a bit unusual. It starts out at 40 EU/t and then gradually goes down. But even when it uses 40 EU/t - which is usually MV - a single LV energy hatch suffices, as long as you give it enough power. Just keep in mind that this makes the Cleanroom an exception, not the rule.%n%nLet's build a 5x5x5 room for now. You can expand it later as needed. Give it power and let it run until it reaches 100%% efficiency. Below 100%% efficiency, machines inside the cleanroom have a chance to void outputs, so you want to keep the cleanroom running at all times!%n%nAny maintenance issue reduces the maximum efficiency by 10%%. Monitor your cleanroom with a Hand Scanner, Industrial Information Panel, or using a Needs Maintenance Cover and a Redstone Powered Light or Howler Alarm.%n%n%n[note]Multiblocks such as the Large Chemical Reactor or Hyper-Intensity Laser Engraver don't need to be in a cleanroom. However, you will still need the cleanroom later on for other machines, like Bio Labs.[/note]%n%n[note]Other helpful hints: you can use an AE Wireless Connector or a Transvector Interface for item transport to avoid machine hulls, and use a higher tier energy hatch to reach 100%% efficiency faster.[/note]%n%n[warn]Keep in mind that you can not use anything in the cleanroom that causes pollution, or the cleanroom will stop working.[/warn]

# Quest: A Very Useful Scanner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADrQ.name=§6§lA Very Useful Scanner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADrQ.desc=The portable scanner is a tool capable of showing advanced information about almost every block in the game. In order to function, the tool needs to be charged first. It can hold up to 400k EU and accept 128 EU/t or less. This is MV tier.%n%nIt can scan crops by right-clicking it to fully scan it, unlike a cropnalyzer which needs a seed bag in your inventory, and takes multiple goes. Crops that were scanned in the world will drop a scanned seed bag.%n%nIt can scan machines from GregTech, giving information about current progress, the stored energy, efficiency, problems and CPU-load - be sure to check the full chat window for additional details.%n%nFor any block in the game it scans, it gives information about its ID, Metadata, position in the world and hardness value. It also gives information about pollution level in the chunk the scanned block belongs to.%n%nIn addition it shows when the cleanroom has reached its 100 percent efficiency level.

# Quest: The 'Water Problems' Are Solved
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADug.name=§6§lThe 'Water Problems' Are Solved
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADug.desc=After entering the HV age you've found a way of making a water reservoir which solves the finite water problem. Craft it with some fused quartz glass, HV pumps, and cauldrons.

# Quest: EBF Info
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEmw.name=§6§lEBF Info
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEmw.desc=You can use a scanner to manually check how your EBF works, or you can make an information panel from nuclear control and always see the status. Make a GT sensor kit and use it on the EBF controller. Place the sensor card in your info panel. Enable it with a redstone signal.%n%nThe GregTech sensor card can monitor GregTech machines like the EBF, Turbines, and Pyrolyse ovens. This is handy for keeping an eye on maintenance issues for multiblocks.%n%nIf you want to put the panels far from the machines they are monitoring, you will need range upgrades.%n%n[note]There's also a more advanced version.[/note]

# Quest: Assembly Line
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFhA.name=§6§lAssembly Line
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFhA.desc=The Assembly Line (or 'Assline') is an important machine for high tier components in LuV tier and above for making Motors, Pistons, Robot Arms, Pumps and many more.%n%nThe multiblock can be 5-16 blocks long. The minimum length required depends on the number of components and fluids required by the recipe it's crafting. A length of 11 blocks will fit 80 percent of all recipes in GTNH.%n%nThe bottom layer must have on one outer side all the Input Hatches for fluids (4), in the bottom middle layer Input Buses for items (10), and on the end 1 Output Bus. Also on the bottom outer layer must be one Maintenance Hatch. The rest is Solid Steel Machine Casings.%n%nThe second layer on the outer sides left and right are Reinforced Glass and in the middle center Assembly Line Casing.%n%nThe third layer has on the left and right Grate Machine Casings and in the middle Assembler Machine Casings (Note the name change!). The Assembly Line control block and Data Access Hatch are on the opposite edge from the Input Hatches - not at the end with the Output Bus.%n%nThe fourth layer is a single line of Solid Steel Machine Casings in the middle (11), with two Energy Hatches for power. Once you have it built, you can replace the two IV energy hatches with 1 LuV energy hatch.%n%nAutomating the assline is a difficult challenge! You can use advanced tools like SFM or OpenComputers, but maybe you can figure out how to do it with Enderio or just AE2.%n%nFor more details on using the Assembly Line, check out the wiki page [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Assembly_Line[/url]%n%n[note]BTW the input buses are ULV to help with your automating, if you don't want to automate it, you can use higher tier ones, unlike the CAL.[/note]%n%n[note]You can have up to 16 input buses. If you use the full 16 you should put the output bus to the side.[/note]%n%n[note]When using buses of a higher tier than ULV it will look for items starting at the top left slot, down to the bottom right slot.[/note]

# Quest: Data Access Hatches
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG-w.name=§6§lData Access Hatches
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG-w.desc=So, if you want to do more than one recipe in your Assline, you want a Data Access Hatch. There are 3+1 versions.%n%nData Access Hatch: It holds 4 data sticks, so 4 recipes.%n%nAdvanced Data Access Hatch: It holds 16 data sticks. Ironically, you can make this right away.%n%nAutomatable Data Access Hatch: It's UV, but it allows I/O of the sticks. Skip it.%n%nThe Data Bank Multi: Can be connected to multiple Asslines, and can contain more than 1 DAH. This is the best way, when you can do it. Look in ZPM for the quest.%n%n[note]You only need to make one.[/note]

# Quest: Time to Drill For Ore!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGCQ.name=§6§lTime to Drill For Ore!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGCQ.desc=Auto Miners are nice but you're going to reach a point where you will want MOOOOOOOOOOOOORE ores. This multiblock will help with that. It will also pre-macerate your ores and give you a little bonus crushed ores as well.%n%nHigher tiers of power will drill faster. You need to upgrade the energy hatch corresponding to the power tier. You will also need an energy hatch, an input hatch, and an output bus - at least MV but you can choose.%n%nLater you can upgrade the ore drilling plant so it extracts from more than a 48 block radius. If you don't want to mine that far away, adjust the range with a screwdriver. Each tier of the controller also gives 1 bonus fortune for small ores starting at 4. At tier 3 you'll want to spread the wealth to multiple compressed chests!%n%nThe multiblock miners have been upgraded so that they will chunkload the area they dig in. They will NOT chunkload themselves however. They will dig §odown§r in the chunk they're in like normal, and then dig §oup§r one chunk at a time in other chunks within its range.%n%nYou need mining pipes in the controller and drilling fluid in the fluid hatch. You can also feed mining pipes into an input bus.%n%nYou'll need to make lots of Drilling Fluid. 64 is a tiny amount to get started with! Plan to make thousands of buckets - perhaps onsite, or pumped in via Long Distance Fluid Pipes.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain (and meteors!) on any side. And set a waypoint with JourneyMap so you don't forget where you placed it!

# Quest: Thermal Boiler - Lava you long time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH6w.name=§6§lThermal Boiler - Lava you long time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH6w.desc=If you want energy from Lava and the byproducts, the Thermal Boiler is the perfect solution. It processes Lava super fast for Steam, and with a Lava Filter will provide some centrifuged lava byproducts as well. A great source of Copper, Silver, Gold, Tin, Tantalum, and Tungstate, better outputs than regular lava processing in a Centrifuge.%n%nYou can get even better efficiency pairing it with a Large Heat Exchanger. The LHE will turn normal vanilla Lava into Pahoehoe Lava, which will provide Steam and byproducts in the Thermal Boiler. Win/Win/Win!

# Quest: Electrum Flux Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHGQ.name=§6§lElectrum Flux Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHGQ.desc=To process more advanced materials like Cosmic Neutronium, Tritanium and Awakened Draconium you need more than 9000K. Upgrade your EBF to 9900K.

# Quest: Grinding With Wind
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHKA.name=§6§lGrinding With Wind
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHKA.desc=The Windmill is a grinder that uses the force of wind to macerate Items and Blocks. You will only get one crushed Ore from it sometimes. However it does give a bonus when you try to macerate other things. That bonus depends on the item inserted, for example Netherrack has a chance to give two instead of one dust and Wheat will always give one and a quarter flour.%n%nThe dispensers replace a clay block in the walls. Put anything you like in the interior - a bed, stairs, torches, etc.%n%nNormal multiblock rules apply - do not cross chunk boundaries with this multiblock.%n%nIf this is your first GregTech multiblock, as with all the rest you will need to whack the controller with a soft mallet to activate it.%n%nIf you have troubles forming the multiblock, try breaking and replacing the controller block.%n%nThe controller can be fed items via hoppers etc. to allow for larger batches. Just don't allow the dispenser to fill up or it will void outputs.%n%nThe rotor blades will run if the controller is disabled or has no recipe. Remove the blades when not in use or else they'll be used up.%n%nSpeed and output will be affected by wind speed, recipe, and rotor.%n%nMacerates 16 items at a time.%n%nHigh wind speeds will decrease output.%n%nThe durability will decrease according to the wind speed.

# Quest: Awakened Draconium Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHKQ.name=§6§lAwakened Draconium Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHKQ.desc=To process the most advanced materials like Infinity Catalyst or Infinity you need more than 9900K. Upgrade your EBF to 10800K.%n%n[note]With the heat adjustment included, you can get up to 11601K if you OC with UHV hatches. Not that you need it or anything.[/note]

# Quest: Helium is Not Just for Balloons
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHcA.name=§6§lHelium is Not Just for Balloons
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHcA.desc=Higher tier superconducting wires and energy hatches will require helium. Compressing air and liquifying it requires 1802 compressed air cells to get 1 He cell. It's probably better to get it from end stone dust or monazite from the Moon. Another option is to have a look at your oil processing and see how you can get Helium from there.%n%n[note]PS: If you've progressed far enough in the TF, you can also chip off parts of the snow queen's lair. She won't mind, right?[/note]

# Quest: Hot Hot Hot!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIFQ.name=§6§lHot Hot Hot!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIFQ.desc=Once you build your vacuum freezer, you're going to have to carry around hot ingots all the time (assuming you don't automate it). Your old gloves are falling apart, and take up both hands. I think there's a way to glue them together so you can carry hot items with just one hand. Give me some parts and I'll do it for you.%n%n[note]PS: The particle effect is active all the time, so if you don't like that, don't do this quest or don't wear them.[/note]

# Quest: Playing With the Big Boys, Chemically
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJXQ.name=Playing With the Big Boys, Chemically
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJXQ.desc=This facility will process certain chemical recipes you'll need later on, like Rocket Fuels. Keep in mind that recipes can only be made after meeting the required Chemical Plant tier.%n%nIt will need a minecart load of resources, so start mining!%n%nCatalysts are needed in some recipes, place them in the Catalyst Housing. They use durability, this includes ones that don't look like it.%n%n[note]You can make Silicon Carbide in the mixer, you don't need the ABS.[/note]%n%nValid solid casings: (Determines CP Tier for recipes)%n1 Strong Bronze Machine Casing%n2 Solid Steel Machine Casing%n3 Sturdy Aluminium Machine Casing%n4 Clean Stainless Steel Machine Casing%n5 Stable Titanium Machine Casing%n6 Robust Tungstensteel Casing%n7 Vigorous Laurenium Machine Casing%n8 Rugged Botmium Machine Casing%n%nValid machine casings: (Determines maximum hatch/bus tier)%nLV-UHV Machine Casing, UHV unlocks any hatch/bus.%n%nValid pipe casings: (+2 Parallels, -20%% chance to consume catalyst durability per pipe casing starting with 2 parallels and 100%% chance for the first one.)%nBronze%nSteel%nTitanium%nTungstensteel%n%nAll coils from Cupronickel to Eternal are valid. Each one increases speed by +50%%, starting at 50%% speed for Cupronickel.%n%n[note]Additionally: If you have at least Awakened Draconium Coils and Tungstensteel pipe casings, then no catalyst is consumed at all![/note]

# Quest: Better Glass Upgrade, EV Glass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ_A.name=§6§lBetter Glass Upgrade, EV Glass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ_A.desc=The next tier of Borosilicate glass is Titanium (4). Make it to allow higher tier recipes in the Bacterial Vat, higher tier Energy Hatches in the MBF, or better Capacitors in your LSC. Or just use it for machine recipes, whatever.

# Quest: IV Glass

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ_Q.desc=The next tier of Borosilicate glass is Tungstensteel (5). Make it to allow higher tier recipes in the Bacterial Vat, higher tier Energy Hatches in the MBF, or better Capacitors in your LSC. Or just use it for machine recipes, whatever.%n%n[note]PS: If you just want to use it to make machines, check out the Thorium Yttrium glass blocks.[/note]

# Quest: LuV Glass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ_g.name=§6§lLuV Glass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ_g.desc=The next tier of Borosilicate glass is Rhodium-Plated Palladium (6). Make it to allow higher tier recipes in the Bacterial Vat, higher tier Energy Hatches in the MBF, or better Capacitors in your LSC. Or just use it for machine recipes, whatever.

# Quest: UV Glass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAA.name=§6§lUV Glass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAA.desc=The next tier of Borosilicate glass is Osmium (8). Make it to allow higher tier recipes in the Bacterial Vat, higher tier Energy Hatches in the MBF, or better Capacitors in your LSC. Or just use it for machine recipes, whatever.

# Quest: Bacterial Vat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAQ.name=§6§lBacterial Vat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAQ.desc=The Bacterial Vat is a unique multiblock machine with its own recipes. But it also has advanced versions of many brewery recipes.%n%nThe Vat isn't mandatory in this tier, but there are many useful recipes and you'll need it later on, so let's build one!%n%nAll recipes require a §cculture§r, some recipes require a specific §cGlass-Tier.%n%n§rThe culture is made in a BioLab and §lput in the controller.%n%n§l§rThe Glass-Tier is calculated as LV = Tier 1, so this quest requires you to make tier 3 glass.

# Quest: Sievert for the Vat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAw.name=§6§lSievert for the Vat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAw.desc=Some Vat recipes require a certain Sievert (radioactivity) value. So attach this Radio Hatch to your Vat to input radioactive material!%n%nThe Radio Hatch holds rods/long rods of radioactive material and uses them to produce Sievert. The input item determines the Sievert value and how long it lasts. Items stored in the hatch will be used continuously even if machine not active, so make sure you want to craft something before putting items in.%n%nYou can check the stats of an inputted item with a portable scanner. Higher tiers of hatch hold more, from 1kg (HV) to 6kg (UV). Rods are worth 1kg, while long rods are 2kg.%n%nSome recipes require [warn]exact[/warn] sievert, you can use the screwdriver to access the radiation shutter control to adjust how much sv is blocked from being sent to the vat. For example, you need 100sv to make SeaweedBroth, so you'd use Naquadah rods, and block off 30sv.%n%nRod Stats:%nMaterial-Sievert-Apprx. time until used up%nBismuth                 83sv   198s%nUranium 235           92sv    80s%nUranium 238           92sv    80s%nPlutonium 239         94sv    66s%nPlutonium 241         94sv    66s%nNaquadah             130sv   14.5s%nEnriched Naquadah 140sv   10.5s%nNaquadria            150sv     8s%n%nThere are more radioactive materials than these, but these are the main ones.

# Quest: Making the Vat More Efficient!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKBA.name=§6§lMaking the Vat More Efficient!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKBA.desc=Looking at the Vat's recipes you are likely discouraged by the small amount of fluid being produced per recipe. Don't worry! Fluid consumption and production shown in NEI are just the baseline for the lowest efficiency. The efficiency of Vat depends on the amount of fluid in the Output Hatch.%n%nThe efficiency gradually increases as the output hatch fills up and reaches maximum efficiency when it is §cexactly half-filled§r. If the hatch fills even more, the efficiency goes down again, so try to keep it close to half! At maximum efficiency the amount of fluid consumed and produced per recipe is multiplied by 1001. The items and culture are not affected.%n%nThere are different means to keep it at half, including OC (not SFM, it doesn't like BW fluids), fluid detector+machine controller, or a fluid regulator, as well as more off the wall ones such as frames or block-sharing. If you choose the fluid detector route, remember that using a larger output hatch will make it easier to keep it close to half-filled.

# Quest: Something From Nothing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKbA.name=§6§lSomething From Nothing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKbA.desc=Void Miners are basically the same thing as regular ones, except that they draw from the whole pool of ores for the dimension without there having to be any nearby. In addition, you can speed them up by supplying Neon, Krypton, Xenon, or Oganesson.%n%nYou can get Neon reasonably easily from Bartimaeusnek Ore from Ross 128ba. Krypton and Xenon can be produced from centrifuging fuel rods. All three can be produced from the EV liquid air distillation method. Remember you need the Liquid Air Fluid Hatch to actually put in enough liquid air. If you want all the produced gasses from the first 4 slots, you'll need to use the Giant Output Hatch.%n%nTo get Oganesson, you'll need mk3 fusion.%n%nAll four fluids can be replicated, so you'll probably end up doing that.%n%n[note]If you want the Deep Dark's ores, you HAVE to use a Void Miner.[/note]

# Quest: Higher Precision

# Quest: What Even is This?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKyA.name=What Even is This?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKyA.desc=In addition to being a dehydrator multi, it's also a Vacuum Furnace, for which no singleblock exists. It's supposed to be used with the IsaMill Grinding Machine multi and the Flotation Cell Regulator multi for the purposes of ore milling, an advanced method of ore processing that needs a lot of infrastructure, but which gives many new outputs for each ore it supports.%n%n[note]This multi is LuV now![/note]

# Quest: Do I Really Need to Make This?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKyQ.name=Do I Really Need to Make This?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKyQ.desc=Oh wait, yes, you actually need this now! That was supposed to be a rhetorical question!%n%nThe main thing you will probably get out of it is the Quantum Anomaly.%n%n[note]This multi is LuV. But you don't need it until UHV.[/note]

# Quest: TFFT
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKzQ.name=§6§lTFFT
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKzQ.desc=The TFFT is very useful if you don't want to have a bunch of Super Tanks, it also has a modular structure so it can be up to x4.33 times bigger than numbers in this quest.%n%nWith the tier I storage field block, it consumes 27 EU/t but only has about 0.27x the storage capacity of a Super Tank I per fluid.%n%nWith the tier V storage field block it consumes 1134 EU/t and has about 0.54x the storage capacity of a QT III per fluid.%n%nWith the tier X storage field block it consumes 0EU/t (only tier X uses 0) and has about x3.3 capacity of T7 YOTTank (divide by 25 to get per 1 fluid)%n%nYou can use the multi hatch to access all the fluids at once with an ME Fluid Storage Bus or Fluid Ender Conduit.%n%n[note]Remember to turn auto-voiding on if you need it.[/note]

# Quest: Expert MB-Construction
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1g.name=§6§lExpert MB-Construction
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1g.desc=Right-click the controller while sneaking will invoke an action called §osurvival autoplace§r. This will attempt to build the multiblock with items from your inventory, provided the area this multi occupies is clear of obstacles. Again, like hologram spawning, multiblocks that accept multiple types of tiered components or has variable length, the number of MSHPs you hold in hand will decide which tier of blocks will be placed. It will place correct amount of hatches for you, but will usually orient the hatches towards you, not perpendicular to the surface. It will just place casings for you if you don't have any hatches in inventory, unless this spot requires the use of a hatch (e.g. the top center spot of EBF).%n%nSurvival autoplace can also take from your alternative inventories, or items that contain/link to an inventory. Currently, this includes:%n- adventure backpacks, either worn or as an item in inventory%n- AE2 portable cells%n- ME networks connected via any AE2 wireless terminal with item access capabilities%n- Forestry backpacks%n- ender chest inventory, if you have the Ender Backpack from Backpacks mod. Note: ordinary backpacks from the Backpacks mod are NOT supported at the moment.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALeA.desc=You will need machine to process the naquadah in the future.%n%nThis machine is different from most multis. It needs to use [warn]Neutron Accelerator[/warn] this special hatch instead of energy hatch to keep it running.%n%nThe accelerator will increase its Neutron Kinetic Energy (NKE) and when the NKE is between the requested number which you can see in NEI, the machine will work and output the right products. However, if you turn on the Neutron Activator when NKE doesn't meet the requirement, it will still consume your input material but output trash. So be careful with the NKE when you run this machine.%n%nWhen all Neutron Accelerators aren't running, NKE will decrease 72keV/s.%n%nNeutron Activator will explode when NKE is over 1200MeV.%n%n§dYou can enable batch mode with wire cutters.§r%n%n[note]The more height/speed casings you have, the more inefficient the eu->eV conversion becomes, so you then need more power. The math is as follows: Multiply recipe time by 0.9 for each height above 4 and multiply eV you get from your input power by 0.95 for each height above 4.[/note]

# Quest: Focusing Science and Mystery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2A.name=Focusing Science and Mystery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2A.desc=This mechanic is completely optional, and never required for crafting. However, it's greatly incentivized when the number of parallels is high and when crafting the unique items that unlock higher tiers. “Focusing”, in general, means to increase the chances of the outputs in a QFT recipe, and it can be done in two ways, possibly both at the same time. Each method uses a new plasma, both of which are crafted in a T4 Fusion Reactor by using other plasmas as the inputs, including one T3 plasma for each. These plasmas are Neptunium and Fermium and they can be used together, or individually.%n%nWhen Neptunium Plasma is present, the current recipe can have one of the outputs focused. The specific output is chosen with a circuit in the input bus (this is the only thing circuits do for this multi), where circuit 1 is for the 1st output visible in NEI, circuit 2 is for the 2nd output, and so on. It is up to the player to choose which output they want the most out of all the existing ones, and the fact that every recipe has multiple outputs is because of this mechanic.%n%nWhen an output is successfully focused with Neptunium, its chance increases by reducing the chance of all the other outputs. The logic for this change is as follows:%n%n-> Without focusing, the chance of each output is 100 / number of outputs;%n-> If the casing tier matches the recipe tier, the chance of all other outputs is halved and the sum of those halves is added to the focused output (for example, 20/20/20/20/20 becomes 60/10/10/10/10);%n-> If the casing tier is +1 over the recipe tier, halve the other outputs' chance again (for example, 60/10/10/10/10 becomes 80/5/5/5/5);%n-> If the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe tier, set the focused output to 100%% and the rest to 0%%.%n%nIn general, this type of focusing doesn't increase the total amount of outputs, save for the new items added with this multi that will come out in smaller quantities. Instead, it allows the player to replace less useful outputs with the more useful ones, and this choice is completely up to them, as is the choice of focusing at all.%n%nWhen Fermium Plasma is present, the current recipe will have all of its output chances boosted, unless the chance for one of them is 100%%, in which case that chance is unchanged. This happens because the boost increases if the output chance before ferm focusing is smaller, and the maximum boost is achieved when the chance is 0%%, which happens with high-tier nep focusing.%n%nWhen an output is successfully focused with Fermium, its chance increases based on how far it is from 100%% chance. This applies to all the outputs at once, and the logic for this change is as follows:%n%n-> If the casing tier matches the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/4 of the "failure" chance (for example, a 50%% chance output has a 50%% chance of failure, so it gets boosted by 12.5%%, becoming 62.5%%)%n-> If the casing tier is +1 over the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/3 of the "failure" chance%n-> If the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/2 of the "failure" chance%n%nWith the two plasmas combined and a +2 or +3 over recipe tier, a 5-output recipe would normally have 20/20/20/20/20 chances, but it becomes 100/50/50/50/50.%n%nMany lategame multis have parallels, which means they complete the recipe several times at once every time the recipe time is completed, instead of only one, but they require extra EU to achieve this. This makes power the biggest constraint for those multiblocks, and the same happens with the QFT, given that recipe inputs are generally very cheap and simple. Throwing more power at the machine means more outputs, in general.%n%nGiven that, a player that wants a faster QFT will make more catalysts to unlock more parallels, but each added parallels adds to the other ones, to a cap of 64. Focusing, instead, changes output odds, which effectively multiplies the number of outputs per cycle. In terms of speed, a recipe with 4 outputs and 64 parallels runs at the speed of 256 parallels for the focused output if it's nep focused to the maximum of 100%%, since it was 25%% originally.%n%nThis is a lot of saved EU for high-tier, high-parallel QFTs, so it is the main reason for focusing, and both plasmas are useful here. However, plasma consumption is not the same regardless of parallels, it instead scales with the square root of the number of correct catalysts for the recipe, which is to say, the number of parallels.%n%nThis further applies to the 3 new items that are needed to upgrade the casing tiers. Since their output amount is much smaller than usual, they could get a further boost if focusing is being used, to incentivize the plasma mechanic when upgrading the multi.

# Quest: Catalyzing Miracles
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2Q.name=Catalyzing Miracles
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2Q.desc=The QFT uses the kind of catalyst that the Chemical Plant also does. However, like the plants that have Awakened Draconium coils or higher, it does not consume the catalyst's durability on recipe finish, behaving more like a real-life catalyst that is regenerated after being used. This makes the catalysts used here more expensive to craft, as was the case with the Infinite Mutation Catalyst for Mutated Living Solder, which is meant to be used only with those coils that make it last forever.%n%nGiven that there is no durability loss, it would seem only one catalyst needs to be crafted. However, there are two reasons for this to not be true: firstly, each QFT recipe uses a different catalyst; secondly, the QFT checks for parallels by counting the amount of catalysts it has in its Bulk Catalyst Housing for the recipe in question (limit of 2,147,483,647). This system makes it so that crafting 1 of the correct type of catalyst is required to unlock a recipe, but making more is completely optional and only changes the speed at which the multi crafts, provided it gets enough EU input.%n%nEvery catalyst needs some of the materials that it unlocks in the QFT, which is to say, the original processing line will have to be used to craft the catalyst that allows the player to skip it in the QFT. This applies to every recipe, and in turn every line that can be skipped.%n%nTo improve the general speed of processing, your one options is to get more parallels with catalysts. The other, more complicated way is to boost the chances of a successful output by adding more energy to the system, but in a special way: instead of using direct EU, using it to create a powerful plasma works to improve the QFT processing.%n%nIf the correct plasmas are added, the boosting will work, but it is also possible to upgrade the structure itself to perform chemistry skips that are not possible with the base QFT. These upgrades rely on more advanced and powerful materials, mainly in the material progression of DTPF recipes. However, those existing materials are not enough, because the quantum stabilization can't be maintained with those “foreign” substances. Luckily, the QFT itself can produce the items needed to build the upgraded casings, and these items are outputs of some of the skips performed in the multi. It begins by allowing the much simpler production of already-owned materials but, in this process, it unlocks entirely new materials that are useful to improve the structure itself.%n%nThere are three new items and four tiers in the structure. The first tier can be built without them, but every new tier needs a new item crafted in the tier before. These outputs are related to the recipe where they can be obtained, and they possess unique characteristics that, in real life, are only theoretical.%n%nThe first item you will need to craft is the Hyper-Stable Self-Healing Adhesive. To craft this material, proceed with the Glue/Solder recipe by using the Adhesion Promoter Catalyst. Additionally, make these other catalysts to prove you're well set in your QFT journey.

# Quest: Tier 2 Transforming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2g.name=Tier 2 Transforming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2g.desc=After a significant amount of progression, you will be able to build the tier 2 QFT by replacing 2 of its casings, the ones on the exterior shell, by the ones listed in this quest. When finished, the multi will be able to perform the monaline skip and a two out of three naqline skips. Amidst all the expensive materials, there is one that can only be crafted in a t1 QFT, so I hope you've got it going.%n%nThe first item - Hyper-Stable Self-Healing Adhesive. This adhesive is very effective at sticking things together, but it is also quantum-stable, which means that it cannot be altered or damaged by simple quantum fields. On top of that, it also has self-healing properties, which means that it can tolerate the increased energy flow of a tier 2, 3 or 4 QFT by repairing itself even when damaged, regardless of how that damage is applied.

# Quest: Tier 3 Focusing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2w.name=Tier 3 Focusing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2w.desc=With access to even better materials, you can upgrade to a t3 QFT. In this tier, two new skips are available: the final naqline skip and the stem cell skip.%n%nThe second item - Superconductor Rare-Earth Composite. This contributes to promoting the flow of energy, instead of stabilizing the structure like the previous item. Given that damage can be automatically repaired, the focus now is to make it easier for the energy to flow from one component to the next and allow for more energy input into the multi. The existing superconductors can't handle quantum flow well, so this composite can be used instead to remove all resistance to flow across the outer shell of the structure, thanks to the unique composition of the transitions between the rare-earth elements present in the composite. The transition from one to the next is so gradual that the quantum flow has no obstacles or loose ends to escape from.

# Quest: Tier 4 Transforming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM3A.name=Tier 4 Transforming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM3A.desc=The final tier of the QFT, built on many stacks of Spacetime. When it's complete, you will have access to all the skips currently in the game, the new ones being the bio cell skip, the Kevlar skip and the Radox + Xenoxene skip.%n%nThe third item - Black Body Naquadria Supersolid. Even through all the upgrades made beforehand, it's still not possible to reach the stage of chemical skips for the items that are used to build the first QFT, such as the bioware circuits. This is the theoretical limit of the multi, and reaching this limit needs a material obtained from the second half of the Naquadah line. This new Naquadria-related substance has the characteristics of a black body, a material that absorbs all radiation it receives and reflects none, and is a supersolid, which is to say, a solid that flows like a fluid that has zero viscosity. By applying these qualities together, through a single material, it's possible to guarantee easy and steady flow of quantum energy at any EU level, even in the MAX tier. With all these advances put together, the QFT is fully unlocked and can create components up to those made in the UHV tier.

# Quest: Infinity Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkQ.name=§6§lInfinity Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkQ.desc=Smelting with the ferocity of the universe itself.%n%nThis unbelievable material seemed impossible to manipulate into a coil block form, even though its properties made this desirable. It is incredibly stable even at extreme temperatures, but this also made it unable to pack together for coils.%n%nHowever, the situation changed when you thought about using something more intelligent. By integrating a Wetware or better UHV circuit, the Infinity Coil became a reality, controlled by the ever-watching eyes of the circuitry you've spent months to create. From now on, these eyes will watch over your multiblocks.%n%nProvides 11701K heat. You could upgrade your EBF, though at this point it's more likely to be for your MBFs or your DTPF.

# Quest: Algae Pond
betterquesting.quest.Ds_ok-hRS2ODJNs3LUP9kw.name=Algae Pond
betterquesting.quest.Ds_ok-hRS2ODJNs3LUP9kw.desc=Sustainability. It's not the name of the game... but it could be!%n%nIf you've ever wanted to generate many chemicals from a single source, you've probably looked at Oil or Benzene. However there's also the Algae Farm. It's just a pond of sorts, so it doesn't need power to run. Since it also doesn't really follow normal recipes, you won't find any NEI recipe page for the Algae. The multi just produces them on a regular schedule.%n%nThe tier of the multi is given by the casings on the bottom layer of the multi, which all have to match to decide the tier. Each tier from ULV (starting at 50s per batch) till IV (which is 25s per batch) reduces the time it takes to produce Algae by about 5 seconds, and then beyond that each tier will cut the speed in half. The cases will currently work up to UHV cases, and casings beyond that will not work with this machine. Randomly the production speed can either double or triple the time it takes as well, but this happens relatively rarely.%n%nEach tier increase also adds to the amount of Algae you get in a single cycle, as well as the type of Algae produced. Each cycle gives out an exact amount as well as a bonus amount 10%% of the time. The Algae Farm also accepts Compost, that you can make from the algae itself, to boost the multi's tier by one. This might be expensive at the start, but it's heavily recommended in most cases. You can get regular Algae and Green Algae starting at ULV, Brown Algae starts appearing at HV, Golden-Brown Algae at EV, and Red Algae at IV, though most of the cases where they start appearing they start doing so in very small quantities.%n%nTo find out more about the exact output quantities and timings, please see the wiki: [url]https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Algae_Farm[/url]%n%nThe Algae can be used for various chemicals like Methane, Ammonia, Sulfuric Acid, Sodium Carbonate, Ethylene, Lithium Chloride, and even some power-generating fluids. You typically need a Chemical Plant for that. In IV tier you can also combine Green Algae with Glowstone to get Glowing Coral and make Sunnarium from that. If you're curious about all the processing chains, look them up on NEI: quests to cover them are coming up, possibly with more recipes that don't need the chemplant.

Unlike the GregTech Sensor Kit, the Metrics Transmitter Cover §nworks interdimensionally and at any range without the need of range upgrades.§r In addition, since covers remain on machines when they are dismantled, the paired sensor card §nwill continue to work even if the host machine is relocated, and never needs to be recalibrated.§r This makes it perfect for the Ore Drilling Plant and Oil/Gas/Fluid Drilling Rig, which are deployed in the field and often have to be relocated.%n%nHowever, like always, there's a catch. If the Metrics Transmitter Cover is detached from its host machine, §nthe paired sensor card will be destroyed.§r Maybe you shouldn't be using a crowbar around sensitive electronics...

# Quest: Using that Algae
betterquesting.quest.eur7SqfIT8GEE_NxscJj8Q.name=Using that Algae
betterquesting.quest.eur7SqfIT8GEE_NxscJj8Q.desc=So you've created the Chemical Plant, and an Algae Farm, excellent! Time to make some use of it instead of letting it sit there collecting. There's quite a few recipes you can make with Algae, but we'll start with a more simple one.%n%nFor this you'll need some Brown Algae and some Green Algae. This means you need at minimum HV machine casings for the bottom of the Algae Farm. HV will produce up to 8 brown algae every 35 seconds, but can at worst case produce 2 in 105 seconds, while EV will produce at best 20 every 30 seconds, and at worst 12 in 90 seconds.%n%nOnce you have some Green and Brown Algae, you'll have to put them in a tier 2 Chemical Plant (steel based) with some distilled water, and you'll get back Sulfuric Acid. Cheap to produce once you have it all set up, a bit expensive to get there though! There's another Sulfuric acid recipe you can use as well later on, but it'll cost higher tier Algae and a higher tier Chemical Plant.

betterquesting.quest.tQecVBhjRRyfR3sqeNBrtA.name=§6§lOne Fluid Tank to Store it All!!
betterquesting.quest.tQecVBhjRRyfR3sqeNBrtA.desc=If you ever thought that the standard super tanks or quantum tanks were still too small then the YOTTank is the next option.%n%nThe YOTTank compared to the TFFT might only be able to store one fluid instead of 25 fluids. However it makes up for this downside by not having to share any of the fluid storage space with any other fluids. It also does not require any energy input or maintenance requirements.%n%nIf all you want to do is store a large amount of one fluid type then look no further then the YOTTank. It has a special ME input hatch for ae2 connections while having expandable storage blocks. The tank can be both upgraded with the fluid storage blocks and can be increased in height to hold any more fluid.%n%nSo if you want to store your fluid in style then look no further then the YOTTank.%n%n[note]If you're having issues searching for the fluid storage blocks for the YOTTank in NEI then search for: fluid cell block[/note]

# Quest: More Algae Uses

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAA.desc=This bad boy will tremendously boost the byproducts of your cracked fuel or pyrolyse oven. This way you can make industrial TNT, polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene and other plastics more efficiently. You'll also need this for the platline.%n%nYou'll need to make EV circuits in a cleanroom to build this machine.%n%nFor hatches, you can choose your own tier. 1 MV energy does most of the useful recipes. 2 MV energy or 1 HV energy hatch will cover almost all the rest.%n%nYou will need 1 input hatch, and at least 5 output hatches. An output bus will capture any solid outputs.%n%n[note]PS: I listed all the DT recipes on the spreadsheet for you to look at in a convenient format. Now you can easily compare which oil path to take![/note]

# Quest: Bring Me My Vat of Polyethylene!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADbA.name=Bring Me My Vat of Polyethylene!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADbA.desc=Tired of using small cells to process chemicals? Build a Large Chemical Reactor and you can just pipe in and out fluids. Or use the glorious large fluid cells to deliver and remove fluids from the hatches.%n%nYou can decide if the reactor should void any extra products when the outputs are full or not by toggling the void mode in the GUI!%n%nThere are also recipes specific to only the LCR, sometimes even allowing you to skip a step, so keep your eyes open for that.%n%nAdditionally, as a multiblock, LCR also counts as a cleanroom for any cleanroom recipes.%n%nYou will also need:%n1 Maintenance Hatch%n1-2 Energy Hatches%n0+ Input Bus (if a recipe has an item input. For full automation, you should probably use 1 for each material)%n0-1 Output Bus (if a recipe has an item output)%n2+ Input Hatch (use 1 for every fluid)%n1+ Output Hatch (same as above)%n%nYou can use a screwdriver on an output hatch to cycle through its modes. Use shift-right-click to go directly to specific fluid mode, then lock the fluid with a cell for easier automation. This works on more than just the LCR.

# Quest: Hulk Smash!

# Quest: Circuit Assembly Line
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKKQ.name=Circuit Assembly Line
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKKQ.desc=You'll need all of this to create 4 CALs, enough for a single series of circuits. If you only want one (for the microprocessors for example), just divide by 4.%n%nAssuming you got the necessary imprints on the LuV tab, you can now craft the CALs for the crystal processor series. We're starting with 4 since you'll need one per circuit, the imprint is not removable. And yes this means you need one for every circuit type you want to make with the CAL.%n%nAs an Assembly Line, it generally works like the normal one, with different items in each bus, but since it's only one item per CAL, it's far easier to use, and the recipe is cheaper too.%n%nThe CAL uses 'wraps' to make 16 of a circuit at a time (aside from ULV and LV circuits), saving you time, EU, and Soldering Alloy (or Indalloy). You make the wraps in an Assembler with 16 of the item and Polyethylene.%n%n[note]BTW you can change out the Hatches and Buses for better ones, but you still need to keep ingredient order. Also CAL grants perfect overclock.[/note]

# Quest: Steamy Mincer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKzA.name=Steamy Mincer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKzA.desc=This is an upgraded version of your trusty ol' Steam Macerator. As a 3x3 Multiblock, it might seem expensive if you're in the Steam Age. However, the processing time per ore is so low that you can sustain your beginner's ore processing system with it!%n%nThe main reason to switch from this is the HV Macerator, which unlocks a slot for additional byproducts gained from the macerating step of ore processing. The Steam Grinder, in comparison, will only return the first item shown in the recipe output. However, this will do just fine until HV!%n%n§3The Steam Grinder can only process recipes up to LV Tier.

# Quest: MABS
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM1Q.name=§6§lMABS
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM1Q.desc=This unholy union between Mega and GT++ must be the work of some madman. It is the ultimate metallurgical furnace to make your alloys with up to 256 parallels. Using better coils and glass also boosts its speed and reduces energy costs!%n%nThe glass tier limits both the energy hatch tier and the recipe tier. As with other multis, UEV glass unlocks all tiers and UV glass is needed for lasers.%n%nGlass tiers gate recipe tiers, for example UHV recipes need UHV glass.

# Quest: Another Chemical Multiblock?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMig.name=§6§lAnother Chemical Multiblock?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMig.desc=You probably have built a lot of Large Chemical Reactors by now. With the powerful 4/4 overclocking it is one of the strongest multiblocks there is. But what if even that is not enough to satisfy your chemical needs? You can't make it faster after using your best energy hatches available.%n%nFear not, we have a solution for you: The Mega Chemical Reactor. It lets you do 256 parallels for your LCR recipes! And you can still overclock after that if you provide enough power.%n%nIt only unlocks in LuV as it needs 7 Fusion Coil Blocks. Check with your hologram projector to see how it is built and what you need.%n%nThe glass tier limits the energy hatch tier that you can use. You can even use multiamp hatches from TecTech! If you want to use laser hatches however you need at least UV glass.

# Quest: Insane Voltage Multiblocks
betterquesting.quest.RFgYQ7LAQD-p1gHMaeg5Sg.name=Insane Voltage Multiblocks
betterquesting.quest.RFgYQ7LAQD-p1gHMaeg5Sg.desc=Upon reaching the land of IV machinery, you can put together even more multis and speed up your automation!%n%nMany of the multiblocks from IV tier onwards use special alloys, which either need to be cooked like any ingots you've used before (in a Furnace or EBF), but there are also alloys which have to be made in the Alloy Blast Smelter (ABS), as a fluid, which then needs to be solidified.%n%nThe multis that need ABS alloys are further down. To unlock their quests, you will first need to craft the ABS itself. However, there is a large assortment of machines you can craft without it, just by having the respective IV singleblock equivalent and some other resources.%n%nThose will be here... but you might be able to find some more, if you look closely through NEI. Good luck!

# Quest: Advanced Assembly Line
betterquesting.quest.ZIotzqvnRiKu1_1Hb9i1dg.name=Advanced Assembly Line
betterquesting.quest.ZIotzqvnRiKu1_1Hb9i1dg.desc=This is the advanced assembly line from §6GigaGram§rFab.%n%nIt supports item pipelining. That is, it will mimic a real assembly line by consuming ingredients one by one instead of all at start. In effect, it offers a parallelism up to however many item inputs this recipe requires. You can think of an advanced assembly line as a collection of slices which are capable of processing each step independently from other slices. It will start processing once the input bus contents align with any stored data stick. The first slice will consume the input in Bus #1. After (recipe time/number of inputs) time, the first slice's work is concluded and will start the second slice. At the same time, first slice will look for input in input bus #1. If there are still enough input there slice #1 will start working again.%n%nThe terminal slice (the n-th slice, where n is number of item input in recipe) will put the recipe output in output bus when it has concluded his work. Whenever a non-terminal slice finished its work, it will try to pass the work onto next slice. If the next slice cannot find the materials in its input bus, the just-finished slice will remain in [warn]STUCK[/warn] state and hang the assembly line. To help locate these [warn]STUCK[/warn] assembly lines, the controller's front face will have its status light turned orange.%n%nThe EU/t cost of this machine is number of slices active multiplied by the original recipe EU/t. [warn]STUCK[/warn] slices do not consume power. It will use the worst energy supplying hatch's input voltage for recipe tier calculation and normal imperfect overclock. With exotic energy hatches, it can overclock beyond usual voltage tier, but will consume even more power than usual imperfect overclock. Every §2laser overclock§r will 0.3 to power exponent. 1 §2laser overclock§r will have 50%% recipe time and use 430%% power. 2 §2laser overclocks§r will have 25%% recipe time and use 1978%% power. Will not overclock beyond 1 tick. Machine first tries to parallelize, then normal imperfect overclock, then §2laser overclock§r.

betterquesting.quest.fLH_QDPRR6mgCK0PL5iWmA.desc=This multiblock is the perfect solution to high-speed tree farming. Do you need wood for charcoal or benzene power? Nuts for seed oil? Leaf blocks for decoration? Look no further!%n%nThe Tree Growth Simulator can farm almost any tree in the game, and produces all the items you would get by chopping it down normally. All this in a compact 3x3x3 cube, without any lag from growing a real tree.%n%nFirst, place any sapling in the controller slot of the multiblock. Then, insert tools appropriate to the part of the tree you want to harvest in an input bus. Give the machine power, turn it on, and be ready to get flooded by the outputs.%n%nDifferent tools are required to gather different parts of the tree:%n - Saw for logs%n - Branch Cutter for saplings%n - Shears for leaves%n - Knife for fruit%nBetter versions of the tools (Chainsaw, Grafter, ...) will increase the yield! Check the tooltip of the controller block for details.%n%nYou can even use multiple different tools together, and the machine will harvest several different products at the same time!%n%nNote that the tools used will slowly lose durability, so for long-term operation you might want to set up some automatic replacement.%n%n[note]While this machine only requires IV, it is quite expensive to make early in the tier. You will need 16 ZPM circuits and some fancy alloys.[/note]

betterquesting.quest.quLxATDCQFWsrZRuh_gspA.desc=You should have quite the collection of single block Steam machines by now. While these may have gotten you through processing small amounts of materials, there will be a time when you will have to process a multitude of items. This is where Multiblocks come in.%n%nWhile these Multiblocks have a material cost that is way higher than their single block counterparts, they have certain bonuses: they use less Steam, and they can process recipes in parallel, which means that a single recipe cycle can craft multiple items at once, if the Steam provided is enough to sustain it.%n%n§TThey do however have some quirks that need to be taken care of:%n%n-These Multiblocks require §4§lvery specific§r I/O blocks, use only those that are part of the quest%n-They process up to 8 items, where the Basic Tier is made of Bronze and High Pressure Tier is made of Steel (checkout the Multiblock Preview in NEI which will show you different levels of tiers)%n-The Tier and amount of parallel processing can be seen via WAILA if you are looking at the Controller Block%n%n§W[note]With this quest, you have started your journey with Mass Processing.

betterquesting.quest.w5O5rPL_Q_GDp8lxWMd0DQ.desc=You might already have a Steam Multiblock or the Large Sifter. But in EV, IV, and the following tiers you unlock multiblocks for (almost) every GT machine. And some more on top of that!%n%nMost of them are made to do the same GT processing as the singleblock machines you've been using, but much faster. The multis can have up to three bonuses: energy savings, faster recipe time and parallels, which mean that a single recipe cycle can craft multiple items at once, if the power provided is enough to sustain it.%n%nThe variety of structures and intricacies of these new multis can go far beyond simpler multis like the EBF, LCR or VF. While some are simple cuboids, others come with more diverse mechanics and conditions to work properly. In return, they can be extremely powerful, so keep an eye out for them!

# Quest: Megalomania

betterquesting.quest.wGINqtSuSQKLI_Yk7hAdcA.desc=In HV, you now technically have the ability to construct Megas for some machines. These absolute titans will boost your production to levels never-before-seen, at a price. These multiblocks have two major benefits:%n-They innately have 256 parallels.%n-They can use TecTech exotic hatches, allowing you to empty out tremendous amounts of power into them.%n%n[note]To get real benefit from these multis, you will want to use lots of power and take advantage of their extreme parallelization - consider whether or not you can actually make use of these before you go off building a Mega Blast Furnace in HV...[/note]

# Quest: Pressure washing!
betterquesting.quest.zorY0c3BQuqLJp7ThOLG-g.name=Pressure washing!
betterquesting.quest.zorY0c3BQuqLJp7ThOLG-g.desc=If you have been processing the ores you have gathered until now, you will have come across a variety of crushed ores. Since these are quite dirty, you will have to clean them up to get certain byproducts. But how do you clean up this multitude of crushed ores? By using a Steam Purifier, of course! With a steady flow of Steam and a bit of Water, you can wash away impurities and get Purified Crushed Ores in no time.%n%nIf you're tired of waiting forever for your ores to clean up, this is your fix!%n%n§3This Multiblock has two modes, the default Washer Mode and a Simple Washer Mode. Simple Washers process ores considerably faster, but they do not give byproducts. Like other Multiblocks, the mode can be toggled by the respective button inside the GUI or by right-clicking the Controller with a Screwdriver. Since all ore washing recipes are LV, this Multiblock can run all of them.

betterquesting.quest.3r7tJ7_bTuePzsh-B_jyIQ.desc=It's like cured meat... no, not at all, many sacrifices were made on the path to understanding radioactivity, may they be remembered forever. This goes to you, Marie and Pierre Curie.%n%nThis is the only non-plasma produced in a fusion reaction in this entire chain. That's not the important part, though: the important part is that [warn]this is one of the bottlenecks of the chain.[/warn] For every reactor running the final recipe, you will need around 0.144 reactors of this, so you won't make it to a compact at the end with just one mk1 reactor. Expect to follow the count of the second-to-last recipe, the Advanced Nitinol one.

# Quest: XL Turbo Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.4HoSq97QT3G63VJFeV_0ZQ.name=XL Turbo Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.4HoSq97QT3G63VJFeV_0ZQ.desc=The first of the XL Turbines. Because this is the first, this quest will include an explanation for the mechanics shared across all XL Turbines.%n%nEvery XL Turbine can hold 12 turbine items inside, in the 12 Rotor Assemblies, but their total speed is 16x higher than the regular multiblock equivalent. Make sure all the turbine items inside are of the same material, and also that you can provide enough input to match the flow rate that the multi needs! If you need even more speed, you can enable Loose Mode with a screwdrier on the controller, which can greatly increase turbines' flowrate while decreasing the efficiency.%n%nThese huge turbines also support TecTech hatches, so you can use multi-amp dynamos with a much higher output amount than normal, or even laser outputs later on to sustain the hundreds of millions of EU/t that the strongest turbines can produce.%n%nEach of the 5 turbines takes in the same fuels as their smaller counterparts, with some exceptions that will be mentioned in the respective quest. This XL Steam Turbine only consumes Steam, as expected.

# Quest: Calcium Bottlenecking
betterquesting.quest.9j1Iwd3KRG6jqLI9m6YDKQ.name=Calcium Bottlenecking
betterquesting.quest.9j1Iwd3KRG6jqLI9m6YDKQ.desc=Craft yourself some bone-strengthening Calcium in plasma form.%n%nThis step is almost twice as fast as the Boron one, so you only need half the reactors, plus one, or the tier above the reactors on the Boron side. It would normally be a lot slower, but the next step needs only a small amount of Calcium.%n%nKeep in mind that, at the end of each of the three fusion chains, the plasma amount gets multiplied, which means that most of your bottlenecks will be near the end of the entire setup, if you're going for Celestial Tungsten Plasma.%n%nYou will need 2.13 reactors with this recipe to feed 1 reactor with the next step.

# Quest: Portable Clean Energy IV

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA2A.desc=This is the IV version.

# Quest: MV Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWQ.name=§6§lMV Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWQ.desc=Having moved up to MV, you can continue using Steam. However, it's not a great idea to stay here, and other fuel types will be more useful to you instead. This is because Steam Turbine efficiency drops quickly with every tier (this one is only 75%%), and the Steam itself needs big pipes to carry it around, compared to Benzene or Diesel.%n%nThat said, if you want to keep using this, then it's a good idea to build a Large Bronze Boiler or, later on, a Large Steel Boiler. You will need lots of solid fuel, probably Charcoal, so make sure you automate it! Definitely do not forget the water.

# Quest: Standard Nuclear Fuel: Uranium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAvw.name=Standard Nuclear Fuel: Uranium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAvw.desc=Just "regular" uranium fuel, nothing special about it. It produces 5x the power, and 4x the heat of thorium, while lasting 2/5 the time.%n%nMost fuel rods are basically this, but slightly modified. You generally get this from Mars and its moons, but you can get a little from centrifuging thorium if you want.%n%nBTW, one of the reactor types 'pulses' the reactor to turn it off once it gets too hot. You can pack in the rods and then cool it off for a while to get higher efficiency out of each rod. Try it if you like explosions.

# Quest: Tricky Nuclear Fuel: MOX
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwA.name=Tricky Nuclear Fuel: MOX
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwA.desc=Under normal conditions, produces the same amount of power as uranium, but MOX produces more power the more you let the reactor heat up. Try to come up with a heat-neutral design as close to the limit as possible to take advantage of this. It lasts 1/2 the time, and produces more heat once the reactor is over 50%%. A fuel for all the engineers out there.%n%n[note]You'll need to run a uranium reactor for a while to get some plutonium if you don't have another way to get it. Remember that there's more than 1 type![/note]%n%n[warn]Make sure to test in creative and/or use protection against explosions![/warn]

# Quest: Alternate Nuclear Fuel: Tiberium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxg.name=Alternate Nuclear Fuel: Tiberium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxg.desc=They're the same as uranium but produce half as much heat. Given that there's no reactor designs floating around, and the fact that you need to go to Ross128ba, a T5 rocket (LuV) planet to get the tiberium, I'm gonna say they're probably not worth it. If you disagree, make a design and show it to people, 'kay?

# Quest: Obscenely Dangerous Nuclear Fuel: The Core
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB6g.name=Obscenely Dangerous Nuclear Fuel: The Core
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB6g.desc=For the truly insane mad scientists out there. Or people who can read a website (not guaranteed, trust me!). You HAVE to use coolant cells with it if you want power or to have it not explode after 1s.

# Quest: We Need Big Toys
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDw.name=§6§lWe Need Big Toys
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDw.desc=All your little turbines take up too much space? Are you running out of water? It's time to solve these problems. This Large Steam Turbine can help you produce a tremendous amount of energy. It will also distill water for you, so you can use the same water again inside your Large Boiler. Don't forget to make a rotor for the turbine and put inside the controller, otherwise this multiblock won't do anything.%n%nEach turbine has a specific optimal flow, the Steam flow that gives the highest fuel efficiency, the value shown on the turbine's tooltip. This is the flow you want to match, and you can use a Fluid Regulator as a cover to make it exactly what you want, but you can go beyond this flow to get an even higher EU/t value, at a loss of fuel efficiency. You can make turbines in 4 different sizes, with larger turbines producing more EU/t, but with variying amounts of fuel efficiency. Generally, Large is the best due to having the highest fuel efficiency and a good optimal flow rate%n%nWhen using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Steam Turbines being the worst at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 150%% of optimal flow to produce 112%% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 200%% of optimal flow to produce 133%% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 250%% of optimal flow to produce 156%% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away. Don't exceed your dynamo hatch's maximum EU/t output, though, or you will have problems!%n%nTurbines with a small turbine durability below 75k have their recipes removed. Use NEI with the appropriate long rod to find assembler recipes that will work for you. Or the spreadsheet. Long magnalium for small turbines, long titanium for normal turbines, etc.%n%nPre-moon, the best rotors are Shadow Metal or Vibrant Alloy.%n%nPost-moon, the best HV rotors are Shadow Metal or Oriharukon (this is IV-tier). Luckily, turbines are now fully functional with multi-amp dynamos, so give those a try if you need extra amps!%n%nFor additional choices, see the spreadsheet and Large Turbine Calculator.

# Quest: HV Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFew.name=§9§lHV Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFew.desc=Using Steam as your single power source in HV is pretty difficult. Your fuel automation will have to be very fast, your pipes will have to be very big and the final efficiency of HV Steam Turbines is 66%%, much lower than the other generators' 85%%.%n%nThis is best used with an efficient furnace, like the GT++ Advanced Furnaces, to power something specific like a farm. Powering your entire automation in your path to an EV, using only these, is a nightmare. If you want more efficiency out of your Steam, consider building a Large Steam Turbine.

# Quest: What Was That? I Can't Hear You Over the Engine!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFyQ.name=What Was That? I Can't Hear You Over the Engine!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFyQ.desc=The Extreme Combustion Engine is an upgrade to the Large Combustion Engine, the IV version that needs Tungstensteel instead of Titanium. The structure is essentially the same, and it's almost a 1:1 ratio between the two materials, so this is a good generator when you've accumulated several stacks of Tungsteensteel.%n%nThe caveat is that it only accepts High Octane Gasoline. This is the last and most powerful type of combustion fluid made from Oil, and it has the longest processing line of them all. As a reward, it has an excellent §e§b§a2.5M EU per bucket§a§r, and you can burn it here alongside some Liquid Oxygen for almost §a4 IV amps per tick.%n%n§cThe Liquid Oxygen is very important, because it greatly boosts the speed of the multi and the fuel efficiency as well. §f§rIt needs 40 L/s, so you will need more than one Vacuum Freezer to supply it continuously: for an ECE that is always running, you will need a double Vacuum Freezer, 1 EV and 1 HV. You can run fewer freezers if you overclock them, if the ECE isn't working all the time or if you upgrade to a Cryogenic Freezer,

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGzA.desc=Your old and trusty combustion engines don't quite cut it anymore, not to mention they're polluting the place. If you want to keep burning liquids, you need to build a better engine. This multiblock can produce 1A of EV voltage by default and 3A if you supply it with oxygen. However, this power doesn't come for free - you need to supply the machine with small amounts of lubricant constantly (and oxygen if you want to boost both its efficiency and output).%n%nYou will also require 3 Input Hatches, a Muffler, and a Dynamo Hatch. Their tiers are up to you.%n%nCetane Boosted Diesel and High Octane Gasoline (HOG) are excellent fuel sources for this engine.%n%nYou will need to keep the area in front of the engine clear so it can pull enough air - not even torches.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHTQ.desc=The MV Gas Turbine pairs excellently with Benzene, now that you can actually make it. Look at the "Bio for the Masses" tab for more details on how to go about it, or just check NEI. Benzene is renewable from trees, and it's a powerful source of EU that can keep you going for several tiers as long as you upgrade it with the new multiblocks you unlock over time.%n%nIt's a good idea to switch off Steam, since you need big pipes to carry that around and the fuel efficiency on Steam Turbines is lower. Instead, make a Pyrolyse Oven or an Advanced Coke Oven to make Charcoal faster, extract Benzene from it and run it through a few of these Gas Turbines.

# Quest: Diesel Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHTg.name=§6§lDiesel Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHTg.desc=The MV Combustion Generator burns Light Fuel faster than the LV version, but you can also automate Diesel and burn that instead, since it's even more powerful. It is arguably the easiest and most efficient way to generate lots of power for automation at this stage, and it'll last you a couple more tiers if you upgrade it as you go.%n%nAdditionally, Diesel can be used as fuel for the Copterpack, a good jetpack that makes it much easier to move around, inside and outside of your base. It's heavily recommended that you make one, if you have Diesel.%n%n[note]This will also unlock new quests in the Armors and Jetpacks tab.[/note]

# Quest: Fluid Regulator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHZQ.name=§6§lFluid Regulator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHZQ.desc=Turbines require precise amounts of fluids or else they will [warn]explode[/warn]. Use the fluid regulator on the pipe attached to the input bus to control the rate of fluids into the turbine. To raise the fluid limit, look at the right side of the regulator and:%n%n1L - Right-click with an empty hand%n16L - Right-click with a screwdriver%n256L - Right-click with a screwdriver while sneaking%n%nTo lower the fluid limit, do the same while looking at the left side.%n%nUse the Large Turbine Calculator and the Turbine stats sheet on the spreadsheet to find what to set it to (after deciding on a fuel). At GTNH, we do the math for you! For this at least.%n%n[note]If you shift-right-click on it you can use the interface which is more precise.[/note]

# Quest: Gas Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHZg.name=§6§lGas Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHZg.desc=A Large Gas Turbine is more fuel-efficient than singleblock turbines, and can have lower pollution output with upgraded mufflers.%n%nYou will also need a Muffler and Dynamo Hatch to complete the multiblock. Don't forget to use a Fluid Regulator, to control the flow rate into the multi! It can usually be an LV Fluid Regulator, since the optimal flow is much lower here than in Steam Turbines.%n%nEach turbine material has a specific fuel efficiency (the higher, the more EU you get from the same amount of fuel), and the multi only reaches this efficiency if the fuel flow into it matches the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 150%% of optimal flow to produce 112%% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 300%% of optimal flow to produce 180%% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 450%% of optimal flow to produce 252%% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.%n%nFor the best turbine materials, see the spreadsheet and Large Turbine Calculator.

Like naquadah, they're the same as MOX other than materials.%n%n[note]PS: You can get Nq* from both centrifuging Nq or Nq+ dust, processing the ores, or thermal centrifuging the depleted Nq+ rods.[/note]

# Quest: Large Heat Exchanger - Fermat's Last
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHcQ.name=§6§lLarge Heat Exchanger - Fermat's Last
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHcQ.desc=The Large Heat Exchanger is a powergen multi that accepts a non-direct fuel, and doesn't output EU. What is it for, then? §7To heat up water with hot liquids, that's what!§r%n%nEffectively, it's a Steam Boiler that uses fluids instead of solids, but it's more complicated. The three sources of energy are Lava, Hot Coolant, and Hot Solar Salt. The salt is the most powerful, but hardest to get. Lava can be automated from Everburn Urns or a myriad of other options, Hot Coolant usually comes from Fluid Nukes, and Hot Solar Salt is produced in the Solar Tower.%n%nFor Lava, the LHE outputs §d160 L of Steam for every 1 L of Lava, up to 1000 L/s of Lava input§r (§a4000 EU/t§r at 100%% turbine efficiency). For Hot Coolant, the LHE outputs §d400 L of Steam for every 1 L of Hot Coolant, up to 800 L/s of input§r (§a8000 EU/t§r at 100%% turbine efficiency). For Hot Solar Salt, the LHE outputs §d2000 L of Steam for every 1 L of Hot Solar Salt, up to 160 L/s of input§r (§a8000 EU/t§r at 100%% turbine efficiency).%n%n§cIf you go above these input rates, the output becomes Superheated Steam, which needs to pass through a Large HP Steam Turbine before the regular Large Steam Turbine.§r The maximum input rate here is twice of what was before and the conversion rates are now §d1:80 for Lava§r, §d1:200 for Hot Coolant§r, and §d1:1000 for Hot Solar Salt§r. The energy output at 100%% turbine efficiency is §a12000 EU/t§r for Lava, §a24000 EU/t§r for Hot Coolant, and §a24000 EU/t§r for Hot Solar Salt.%n%n§6§lVery powerful, but complicated, and needs turbines!§r%n%nFor more information, visit [url]wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Large_Heat_Exchanger[/url] or [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Fluid_Reactor[/url].

# Quest: How Many Forests Did You Cut Down to Power This?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK4g.name=How Many Forests Did You Cut Down to Power This?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK4g.desc=This is the HV version, with the lowest efficiency so far of 85%%. You can offset that by just generating more Benzene, alongside Phenol and Toluene in a Distillation Tower, or use Naphtha instead... You have many options at this point, surely enough to fight the increasing power demands of your automation.%n%nBenzene doesn't get upgraded in HV, only in EV. You'll be able to make Nitrobenzene when you're there, and burn it in some turbines bigger than this one.

# Quest: Even Better Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK4w.name=Even Better Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK4w.desc=In HV, you unlock yet another generator, but also Cetane-Boosted Diesel. After a bunch of reactions, you can get a superpowered combustion fuel that is worth §a1M EU per bucket§a§r and run it for quite a while on these improved generators. You will also unlock the Distillation Tower here, so you might get even more fuel that you can burn in these generators.%n%nUnfortunately, the next fuel, unlocked in EV, doesn't come from Diesel. It's a completely different processing line, should you wish to tackle it later.

# Quest: Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators LV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5A.name=Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators LV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5A.desc=You've probably collected a ton of Creosote and have little to use it on. To fix that, build a Semifluid Generator and use it alongside Steam as a secondary power source! Singleblock generators will only use fuel if there is EU demand, so you might end up with a filled Creosote buffer if you aren't consuming enough EU.%n%nTo extract the Creosote from your Coke Ovens, you can use buckets or cells to do it by hand, or the TiCon Faucet into GT fluid pipes, or an Electric Pump cover from You're Going to Hate This #2.%n%nThere are other options to burn Creosote, like the Railcraft Liquid Boilers, but this is much cheaper and easier to set up, while still being efficient with Creosote (6x as efficient as Combustion Generators).

# Quest: Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators MV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5Q.name=Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators MV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5Q.desc=If you're still burning Creosote for power, you can get MV amps out of it with these machines. It won't last long, and definitely isn't a good main power source, but it'll give you some EU for your trouble.%n%nAlternatively, Heavy Fuel? It has the same EU per bucket as Benzene, 360k, and is the only semifluid with more than 100k per bucket. If you have it, and are not consuming enough for Diesel, you can use it this way.

# Quest: Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5g.name=Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5g.desc=If you've built Distillation Towers to improve your Oil or Benzene processing line, you might have ended up with some extra fuels that are semifluids, such as Heavy Fuel or Creosote. If you've accumulated them so much that they've started voiding, you can instead make an HV Semifluid Generator and get free power out of them!%n%nThe Creosote from one DT that is processing Wood Tar is enough to power the DT itself, depending on the fuel efficiency. One HV generator is just enough to power it.

# Quest: You Haven't Learned How to Separate Fluids Yet? Seriously?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5w.name=You Haven't Learned How to Separate Fluids Yet? Seriously?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5w.desc=This multi follows the same logic as the Large Combustion Engine, but it uses semifluids instead.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKyg.name=This is Not How You Get Into Space
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKyg.desc=This produces power out of Rocket Fuels. To see how to make them, look at the Space Race tab. These are specifically GT++ Rocket Fuels, and automating them for powergen in this multi will also provide you with endless fuel for your space travels.%n%nThe math regarding the Rocketdyne is complicated. Looking at the controller's tooltip helps, but the main gist of it is like this: provide Carbon Dioxide and make sure it doesn't run out, choose the EU/t you want to get, calculate the amount of fuel you need for the fuel you will use, and then provide enough Liquid Hydrogen to boost the multi, according to the EU/t value.%n%nYou will always want to have the Rocketdyne boosted, for several reasons. Assuming you have at least a buffered IV Dynamo Hatch, outputting close to the maximum on that hatch will lower the fuel efficiency, but not if it's boosted. Additionally, this multi doesn't consume fuel continuously, but with intervals of 1 second between consuming and not consuming, while generating power all the same. Boosting this consumption results in huge fuel efficiency, combined with the high fuel values of the Rocket Fuels.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALCg.desc=It's the same as the previous, but more/better. It takes less time to heat up, but it chews through fuel pretty fast too. It still isn't as good as an LGT for power produced over time, but it can produce power faster. As long as you use it with the HP Steam Turbine.%n%nIt can produce 1A+ of LuV if you set it up right.

# Quest: Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Mk I

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALCw.desc=It uses Gas fuels to produce power and Steam at the same time, while also generating 0 pollution. If the other generators were being problematic, this is the best solution.%n%nIt produces §a4 HV amps per tick§r at a nice fuel efficiency, while consuming 100 L of Oxygen per second. It will heat up over time until it reaches 100%% efficiency, at which point it starts outputting Steam as well. You can then use Steam Turbines, singleblocks or multiblocks, to generate even more power.%n%nWith these two things combined, it's more powerful than the Large Gas Turbine that you can build at the start. Only when you unlock better materials for that, will it generate more power than the SOFC Mk I.

# Quest: It's 'Super' Heated Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDA.name=It's 'Super' Heated Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDA.desc=So that means it produces §otwice§r as much power! You can get this steam through the LHE, the SOFC Mk II or the Titanium/Tungstensteel Boilers. It gets converted to normal steam as the output at a 1:1 ratio, so make sure to have a non-HP one to take advantage of that. In total, an HP Steam Turbine and a regular one combined produce 3x the EU with Superheated Steam that normal Steam would produce.

# Quest: More Advanced Reactors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDQ.name=More Advanced Reactors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDQ.desc=Fluid Nukes, Vac Nukes and Wrench Reactors (lol), are more advanced versions of the normal one.%n%nFluid means you build it differently (with the parts on the right, it's a 5x5 cube surrounding the normal one), with the goal of producing as much hot coolant (cycle in non-hot) as possible, to use that to produce power. It doesn't produce power on its own, but more overall. Send it to the LHE to get SH steam out of it, then go through an HP steam turbine, then a normal steam turbine.%n%nVac nukes remove heat by sending it to coolant cells instead of coolant. Any cell in a cardinal direction will receive the heat instead of the reactor. Use a vacuum freezer to restore the Helium/NaK cells' durability.%n%nWrench reactors are when you fill the reacor with fuel rods, turn it on, and wrench it to reset its heat state before it explodes. If you can automate it, you deserve a medal!%n%nIf you still don't know what a MOX one is, it produces more power the higher the temperature, so you try to keep it heat neutral, and as hot as possible. Of course, this can cause things nearby to, well, §omelt.§r You use MOX or Naquadria fuel cells work for this. You can also get more Plutonium out of MOX than Uranium.%n%nA breeder reactor is when you set up a reactor to get an item out of it rather than power, like Lutetium from Thorium, Plutonium from MOX, etc. Look at the depleted x fuel rod list in NEI or on the wiki to see more.%n%n[note]Since Fluid Nukes are liable to explode if you run out of coolant, make sure you set up a cutoff tied to the temperature or amount of coolant with redstone.[/note]

# Quest: Naquadah Fuel Refinery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALjw.name=Naquadah Fuel Refinery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALjw.desc=This insane machine is used to make MkIII and higher tier naquadah fuel.%n%nIt can't be overclocked by increasing the input voltage. The only way to overclock it is to use higher tier coils.%n%nIt also supports §9Tec§1Tech§r's Multi-Amp energy hatches and laser hatches.%n%nExample: The MkIV fuel requires tier 2 coils and the refinery is using tier 3 coils. This gives a perfect overclock, using 4x power and 0.25x time.

# Quest: Tier 2 Coil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALkA.name=Tier 2 Coil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALkA.desc=It will unlock 2 MkIV fuel recipes and MkV fuel recipe.

# Quest: Naquadah Based Fuel MkI
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALkQ.name=Naquadah Based Fuel MkI
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALkQ.desc=975 000 EU/t lasting 3 seconds per liter of fuel. Possibly a viable alternative for Plasma Power?%n%nPrepare a robust naquadah line if you seek the power of the Naquadah Fuels.

# Quest: Naquadah Based Fuel MkII
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALkg.name=Naquadah Based Fuel MkII
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALkg.desc=2 300 000 EU/t lasting 3.5s per liter. A good way of getting more power out of your naquadah fuels, if you can supply the materials.%n%nYou might require the Mega Chemical Reactor if attempting this in ZPM.

# Quest: Naquadah Based Fuel MkIII
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALkw.name=Naquadah Based Fuel MkIII
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALkw.desc=9 511 000 EU/t lasting 4s per liter. Prepare to make a lot of this, as all subsequent tiers of Naquadah Fuel start from Mk III.%n%nThe alternate recipe can ease the logistical demand, but sourcing the chromatic glass might prove problematic until later.

# Quest: Naquadah Based Fuel MkIV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALlA.name=Naquadah Based Fuel MkIV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALlA.desc=88 540 000 EU/t lasting 5s per liter. Now the Naquadah Fuels are starting to get really good. Look into depleting Excited Thorium Fuel to source the praseodymium required.%n%nThe alternate recipe will require a Dimensionally Transcendent Plasma Forge, but can further ease the entire supply chain.%n%nHere might also be a good time to start thinking about using Molten Neutronium to improve the yield of High Density materials.

# Quest: Naquadah Based Fuel MkV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALlQ.name=Naquadah Based Fuel MkV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALlQ.desc=399 576 000 EU/t at 8s per liter. Sourcing the infinity dust and heavy radox might prove problematic until later.%n%nThe alternate recipe still requires the same amount of infinity to make the spacetime, but you get 50%% extra output for a little bit of transcendent metal.

# Quest: Tier 3 Coil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALlg.name=Tier 3 Coil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALlg.desc=For an overclock, MKVI fuel and alternative MKV fuel recipe. Wait, you are going to overclock a UXV recipe?

# Quest: Incomplete Combustion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALlw.name=Incomplete Combustion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALlw.desc=A chemical fuel engine for LuV? Well, if you are a crazy fan of diesel or benzene, you will love it.%n%nThis engine accepts all diesel, gas and also rocket fuel, although the Rocketdyne burns the latter more efficiently. It also needs Combustion Promoter to keep it running.%n%nThis engine consumes all fuel and combustion promoter in its input hatches per second and outputs power depending on the amount of fuel consumed, and its fuel value.%n%nIts efficiency is determined by the Combustion Promoter/Fuel ratio. If the ratio is larger (there is more promoter), the efficiency will be higher. The max efficiency is 150%%, but you cannot achieve this value without inputting an infinite amount of promoter. Expect efficiencies around 130%% for high fuel value fuels like High-Octane Gasoline, unless you spend a LOT of promoter.%n%ne.g. You input 100mB/s of HOG and 1000mB/s of combustion promoter. The efficiency is 149%% and the sum of the HOG fuel value is 250000 EU. The output power will be 250,000 * 149%% / 20 = 18625 EU/t.

# Quest: Advanced Xeninol
betterquesting.quest.D0JaazeIQ8qctaMx9xTqEw.name=Advanced Xeninol
betterquesting.quest.D0JaazeIQ8qctaMx9xTqEw.desc=It's here that you might yourself with some useful stuff alongside power. Xenon, which has become very useful in the EBF thanks to noble gas changes in its recipes, and Advanced Nitinol? If you don't already have a Quantum Anomaly setup for it, you can use this. Who knows what'll come in the future?%n%nThese recipes are the same 0.144 ratio ones that you've seen before and, since they're just before the final step, they will bottleneck you on the path to compact reactor setups. The one to focus on is Advanced Nitinol, which is the second last recipe, and where you'll need 9.216, or 10 Mk3 reactors to sustain a Celestial Tungsten compact at the end. If you build a compact here, however, you can feed 6 compacts as long as everything that comes before this is fast enough.

# Quest: Runite Plasma - The Mk2 Conclusion
betterquesting.quest.DPl-UUZfTAa-ezdD_m8Huw.name=Runite Plasma - The Mk2 Conclusion
betterquesting.quest.DPl-UUZfTAa-ezdD_m8Huw.desc=To complete this chain, you need to activate the Astral Titanium Plasma you have with a special material, also a GT++ one, called Titansteel. This is a considerable powersink, which is why the input amount is so low at 2L, and it forces you to dedicate an ABS at UV tier to feed one mk2 reactor running the Runite plasma recipe. If you decide to upscale this setup, the best option is to simply build a mega ABS, where you can also use EBF coils to save some EU, and in turn make the powergen chain more efficient.%n%nRunite Plasma has a 350M fuel value, which leaves it free to run on Trinium XLs without penalty, whereas Tin Plasma has a 74.5%% penalty on the same turbines due to having less than half the fuel value. If you want to upscale your plasma powergen to great numbers, this is an option, but the mk3 chain is probably the one to choose.%n%nThe same ratio of 0.144 to 1 reactors also applies here.

# Quest: I'll teach you... how to Praise the Sun!
betterquesting.quest.Hn_igsosSbKsnATeYgvPgw.name=I'll teach you... how to Praise the Sun!
betterquesting.quest.Hn_igsosSbKsnATeYgvPgw.desc=TL;DR: The casing amount in this quest is for the best Solar Tower, which generates around 2 LuV amps and is a major Stainless Steel, Titanium and HV circuit sink, amongst other things.%n%nHave you ever laid eyes upon a solar panel? You might have built a few of them here. What do they all have in common, I ask you... they generate either Steam or EU directly from sunlight, and that is not efficient. There's something that everybody forgot!%n%nSingleblock solar panels are best to insert anywhere that has sun, and provide constant power to a machine. However, EU storage and transport are easy here, so why not build something better? Instead of generating energy directly, send those warm beams of sunlight into a central structure with circles of Solar Reflectors, and bask in the eternal power of the biggest fusion reactor in the Solar System!%n%n(If you end up making a bigger one, don't come arguing to me about this. Be quiet.)%n%nThe whole idea is that the energy of the Sun's rays is directed towards a fluid that can retain the energy, a Solar Salt that does it far better than water. The Solar Tower transfers heat to all the fluid inside it, but watch out! If there's too much cold Solar Salt inside, it will drain away all the heat and slow down the entire process.%n%nIn more detail, the Solar Tower has a heat value that ranges from 0 to 100000, and it only heats up Solar Salt at 30000 or above. The amount of heat gained per cycle depends on the number of Reflectors, but also the current heat value: this process is optimal at exactly half the maximum, so 50000 heat. To get a perfect tower setup, you have to slowly feed cold Solar Salt to maintain this heat value, taking away just enough heat to keep it there. I'll let you figure out what the flow rate is, given that it depends on how many Reflectors you have.%n%nFrom there, generate Steam or SH Steam by heat-exchanging in the same way as Hot Coolant does it. If you want this setup to truly be optimal, do place it in your personal dimension for permanent daylight.

betterquesting.quest.K0_-BjVuR3qh_GZt19SReQ.desc=You already transcended dimensions, but as your power demands spike to absurd levels, maybe it's time to transcend matter!%n%nUsing the unbreakable stability of Proto-Halkonite, harnessing the power of [warn]Chaos[/warn] becomes a reality. The  Semi-Stable Antimatter Stabilization Sequencer introduces the concept of Semi-Stable Antimatter, created from Protomatter.%n%nBut it's a cruel mistress... fail to manage it, and antimatter could void itself into nothingness.%n%nThe Semi-Stable Antimatter is produced in 1 second cycles, the amount generated is based on the total of antimatter currently stocked in it's 16 Antimatter Hatches and consumes equal amounts of Proto Matter.%n%nEach cycle, the base production of antimatter per hatch is:%n(1/16)*§((§3Antimatter§§§r)^(0.5 + §6§nC§r).%nThen each hatch will pull a random number from a normal distribution of 0.2 + §b§nA §rand a variance of 1, multiplying the base production with it, meaning the total antimatter change may be negative.%n%nThis causes an imbalance between the hatches. To properly automate the antimatter production, it's vital to always re-balance the amount of antimatter in the hatches. At the end of each cycle, the lowest amount of antimatter present in hatches is recorded, and any hatch that contains more than the lowest amount loses half the difference!%n%nProper use of stabilization fluids can significantly reduce energy usage and boost production:%n%nIt consumes 10,000,000 + (§3Antimatter§r * 1000)^§ (1.5 - §2§nM§r§)) EU/t passively%nMagnetic Stabilization Fluids can mitigate the passive instability and have its §2exponent§e§r reduced:%nMolten Purified Tengam Exponent = §2§n0.1§r%nTachyon-Rich Fluid Exponent = §2§n0.2§r%nMolten MagMatter = §2§n0.3§r%n%nFor each cycle, the SSASS uses (§3Antimatter§r * 10000)^(1.5 - §5§nG§r) EU%nBy regulating the gravity containment of the forge, this §5exponent§r can also be reduced:%nMolten Spacetime Exponent = §5§n0.05§r%nSpatially Enlarged Fluid Exponent = §5§n0.10§r%nMolten Eternity Exponent = §5§n0.15§r%n%nBy containing the antimatter more compactly, it is possible to generate larger gains per cycle.

betterquesting.quest.KHL_yx4XTKOtsHHZ60ZZpg.desc=2 077 795 200 EU/t at 12s per liter. A truly immense amount of power, with a hefty cost. You will need a lot of infrastructure to run the refinery, but doing so will reward you with trillions of EU/t.%n%nThe astral titanium and celestial tungsten for alternate recipe can be sourced from laser engravers or the Plasma Fuel Line.%n%nThe tritanium can be sourced using fusion reactors, or by mining in the Deep Dark.%n%nThe shirabon will require an immense amount of fusion reactors and DTPFs to sustain.%n%nAfter Eye of Harmony, white dwarf matter can be used to improve the yield for even more power.%n%nYou will also want to consider the Tachyon Rich Temporal Fluid to get the most out of the Mark VI.

# Quest: Celestial Tungsten Plasma - The Mk3 Finale
betterquesting.quest.LSqzsH4oS7OQrZyolb7C0A.name=Celestial Tungsten Plasma - The Mk3 Finale
betterquesting.quest.LSqzsH4oS7OQrZyolb7C0A.desc=This is the end of the mk3 fusion chain, and the three chains altogether. After 14 fusion recipes on top of Helium Plasma, you hold in your tanks the elusive Celestial Tungsten Plasma, whose fuel value of 720M makes it immune to XL Plasma penalties all the way to spacetime!%n%nUpscaling plasma powergen up to endgame, and the Dyson Swarm, is most likely reliant on either this or Americium Plasma, which is 1-step but not as powerful on a per-reactor basis. This can net you above 8 billion EU per tick, for every Mk3 compact that you have running Celestial Tungsten at 64 parallels, with Infinity turbines. Upscaling this is not so difficult, if you keep in mind which recipes will bottleneck you the most, as long as you have the resources for it.%n%nThere are no plasmas that build off Celestial Tungsten Plasma just yet, but it's possible that some might be added in the future, especially for GT++ materials such as Dragonblood. Congratulations on finishing this fusion chain! May the power be with you.

# Quest: Zzzincing...

betterquesting.quest.Ng5Ldnf3TZCefB4Mr3u-rQ.desc=Do you know how much Zinc you have in your body? Very little, but it's important. Now imagine it's all plasma!%n%nThis is a very fast recipe, like Niobium Plasma. The only caveat is that it uses Tritium (not Trinium), a rare isotope of Hydrogen that you can obtain from Deuterium, a less rare isotope. You can pump it directly from Neptune, through the Space Elevator or simply by centrifuging the Deuterium you already automated for Helium Plasma.

# Quest: AMERICA!!!!!!!!!
betterquesting.quest.Qrjs7uh5TcSveEbaFnXFog.name=AMERICA!!!!!!!!!
betterquesting.quest.Qrjs7uh5TcSveEbaFnXFog.desc=United States of SMASH those particles together to initiate proper controlled fusion reactions that allow us to continue this immense powergen chain. This is Americium Plasma, remember that!%n%nThis is actually the plasma that is probably the best choice for XL Plasma Turbines as a 1-recipe powergen setup. However, compared to Helium and Tin Plasma's previous state, it loses out a lot on speed on a mk3 compact, because it doesn't have the 192x/128x parallels, not to mention its recipe time is already 8x as long as Tin for the same amount of plasma.%n%nIt will also demand huge amount of Pu-241 for a UEV/UIV base to be sustained, but this fusion chain greatly reduces the amount needed, even if both inputs actually need Pu-241.%n%nThis step takes more than half the time of the final step, so it's one of the major bottlenecks: if you upgrade the final step to a compact, you would need 37 mk3 reactors to match speed here.

# Quest: Boronic Fusion
betterquesting.quest.Tfb8JzstRNuiSV6CKgTNRQ.name=Boronic Fusion
betterquesting.quest.Tfb8JzstRNuiSV6CKgTNRQ.desc=This plasma needs Helium Plasma to be crafted. That's right, this entire powergen chain builds on top of Helium Plasma!%n%nThe Boron Plasma step is much slower than the Helium one, so if you match the number of reactors and their tier, you will end up with a large excess of Helium Plasma. As you know, it's very useful for power in Large Plasma Turbines, so you could use this excess to power all the other reactors. As you scale up, however, this alone will probably not be enough.%n%nYou will need 3.75 reactors with this recipe to feed 1 reactor with the next step.

# Quest: Niobiumization

betterquesting.quest.X_rOgp6GRKiyGzwRV_p7GA.desc=Do you remember Niobium-Titanium? This time, it's just Niobium! Just kidding, Titanium's coming up in a special form...%n%nBoth this and the Zinc Plasma recipe are very fast, so you won't need more than 1 reactor unless your scale is very large. Upgrade later as needed, use a mk2 or even mk3 for now.

To turn that potential into unparalleled power, it's time to [warn]harness the chaos[/warn] itself!%n%n[quest]Introducing the Shielded Lagrangian Annihilation Matrix![/quest]%n%nThe SLAM creates raw energy by reacting the Semi-Stable Antimatter with normal matter in a controlled environment.%n%nEvery cycle, the generator will react all antimatter and matter in hatches instantly, converting it all into energy directly. The EU output is based on the equal amounts of antimatter and matter annihilated. Therefore, imbalance between the amounts will waste your precious energy.%n%nDepending on the matter used to annihilate, the antimatter amount gets an exponent applied to it, directly increasing the amount of energy produced from 1L of antimatter - this means the more you annihilate in one go, the more efficient it is!%n%nThe maximum EU for a cycle is limited by the capacity of all laser source hatches on the structure (limited to 64), even on wireless mode.%n%n[note]It can't output more than 9.22e18 EU in a cycle, or just below 43 16M UXV Laser Sources (If you're crazy enough for it)%n[/note]%n%nThe Formula and the exponents for each of the possible matters are:%n%nGenerated EU = (§3Antimatter§r^§6exponent§r) * 1,000,000,000%n%nMolten Copper - §61.00§r%nMolten Superconductor Base UIV - §61.02§r%nMolten Superconductor Base UMV - §61.03§r

# Quest: Welcome to the Plasma Chain
betterquesting.quest.bNiieqPgSFqwFpC2DZkj-g.name=Welcome to the Plasma Chain
betterquesting.quest.bNiieqPgSFqwFpC2DZkj-g.desc=Hello there! If you've unlocked fusion, you can start this questline, but keep in mind that it's divided into three segments (the three fusion chains): one for each tier of Fusion Reactor, from Mk1 to Mk3.%n%nThere is a spreadsheet for all these chains, although it has some reactor count numbers that aren't right. To see it, check the Excel spreadsheet that set these numbers, in the following GitHub link:[url]https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GTplusplus/pull/669[/url]%n%nThese quests follow the process of creating some truly powerful plasmas that are useful for power generation at the beginning of endgame, when you've scaled up your setup to a Compact Fusion Reactor and XL Plasma Turbines. As you might have seen before, those huge turbines can go very fast with good materials, like Trinium or Infinity, but they will apply EU/t penalties according to the fuel value of the plasma used. This means that Helium and Tin Plasma are both much weaker there than they were in Large Plasma Turbines.%n%nThe end product of this whole process is Celestial Tungsten Plasma, which has no penalties even at Spacetime and can somewhat match what Helium Plasma would have produced, per compact reactor. The last step is the slowest, but, if there are no other bottlenecks, you can expect around §2§lover 8 billion EU/t§r assuming a single compact doing the last step with huge infinity turbines in a plasma XL.%n%nHowever, getting there won't be easy. This whole process uses 15 fusion recipes in total, and a lot more material automation than any of the simple fusion setups. This questline will help explain what is simple, not simple, or possibly a bottleneck. If you complete this, you will be sustained in powergen until the Dyson Swarm, or whatever other option appears later on, and it will continue being useful later on!

# Quest: XL Turbo SC Steam Turbine

betterquesting.quest.bz_RazGFSl6k7fUkEt1Lzw.desc=The most dense steam available. Check the XL Steam Turbine quest above for an explanation of the mechanics shared across all turbines.%n%nThis turbine has unexpected bugs related to the integer limit, when using the best turbine materials in the pack. There might also be other limitations when trying to move billions of SC Steam per tick from one place to another. Be wary of bugs when trying to use this XL turbine with endgame turbine materials.

# Quest: XL Turbo Plasma Turbine
betterquesting.quest.dQ1k0UZVR8ObXotgcryKbw.name=XL Turbo Plasma Turbine
betterquesting.quest.dQ1k0UZVR8ObXotgcryKbw.desc=Is plasma flow making the turbines spin? No, it's just water into steam into water, all recycled inside, 12 times over. Check the XL Steam Turbine quest above for an explanation of the mechanics shared across all turbines.%n%nThis turbine, unlike the others, has very important differences to the regular multi that you have to keep in mind. Given that plasma power is so easy to upscale with the use of compact reactors, XL Plasma Turbines would have to follow suit and bring progression's EU numbers to ridiculous degrees, off one single plasma. However, this XL now applies an EU/t penalty to its production by comparing the fuel value of the plasma it processes with the rotor material it has inside.%n%nSee [url]https://i.imgur.com/vifsk0P.png[/url] for various combinations of plasmas and materials. Mk1 plasmas are in green, Mk2 in yellow and Mk3 in red. The bottom 3 are the final plasmas of the fusion chains.%n%nThe formula is a bit complicated, but here are some important values:%n%n-> Helium Plasma receives a huge penalty of 86.1%% even with Infinity Catalyst, whereas Tin's penalty is only 53.5%%, which means that the number of reactors and XLs with this material is twice the expected amount if using Tin Plasma;%n-> Trinium changes these numbers to 92.4%% and 74.5%%, respectively;%n-> Infinity further increases the penalty to 97.4%% and 91.1%%;%n-> Spacetime sets these values to 98.3%% and 94.4%%.%n%nThis means that, at the UHV/UEV stage, you will no longer be able to rely on these two plasmas with your XLs. For 1-recipe plasmas, your best option is the mk3 Americium Plasma, which has an insignificant 0.8%% penalty with Infinity. If you want faster powergen than that, check out the complete fusion chain that ends at Celestial Tungsten Plasma, which has no penalties in the XL Plasma Turbine and has total EU/t numbers compared to Helium's old ones. Check below for quests regarding the fusion chains.

# Quest: This is your Kryptonite!

betterquesting.quest.pLCgOVmqTUCudSXZusnceg.desc=Here's the special Titanium I promised you. GT++ materials enter the fray here, both with this and the Titansteel you need to add to that to make what comes next!%n%nThat step only comes after fusing Niobium and Zinc into Krypton Plasma. You get a rarer noble gas here than before, the next one will be Xenon. This recipe matches in speed with the next one, which uses Krypton to make Astral Titanium Plasma, by adding in the final plasma of the previous chain, Force Plasma! That's right, each chain needs everything from before to continue.%n%nOnce you have Astral Titanium Plasma, you can move on to the final mk2 step.

# Quest: Force Plasma - The Mk1 Ending
betterquesting.quest.tSCw6KSbR8a4TCNWlrmkYQ.name=Force Plasma - The Mk1 Ending
betterquesting.quest.tSCw6KSbR8a4TCNWlrmkYQ.desc=Once you have the two plasmas from before, fuse them together into a new one, Neon Plasma. If you were to use this directly, you could get Neon! There are other, more useful materials to get later in this process, so keep a lookout for those.%n%nHowever, this is not the final plasma in mk1 recipes. To get it, you need to do the last activation step, which exists in all three chains, and involves adding a non-plasma related material, of the appropriate GT tier, to obtain the powergen plasma. The material you need here is Arcanite, one you probably have used before. This step requires you to preferably automate it with ABS, and have a steady supply of Thorium 232.%n%nIf you look at the last recipe, you'll see it's 144L Neon Plasma input to 1000L Force Plasma output. This multiplying makes it so that step, and all final steps, are the slowest ones. You will need 0.144 Neon Plasma reactors for every Force Plasma reactor, which means that 1 Neon reactor feeds nearly 7 Force reactors (6.9444... reactors, more precisely).%n%nOnce you get Force Plasma, this is the end of the mk1 fusion chain. Force Plasma is a 150M fuel value plasma, which means it has a 53.5%% penalty with Infinity Catalyst in XL Plasma Generators. This is better than Helium Plasma with its 86.1%% penalty but still not great for power generation. You probably don't need this in ZPM, but it'll be a stepping stone for your future progression.

Check the XL Steam Turbine quest above for an explanation of the mechanics shared across all turbines.%n%nThis XL Turbine is exactly the same as the XL Steam Turbine in the way it upgrades from the regular multi: the only accepted fluid is Superheated Steam, and nothing else works. They are meant to be built together, since any steam setups you might have at this point will surely be using the two.

betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIQ.name=Storing and Transforming EU
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIQ.desc=You can find ways to store EU here and ways to transform between voltages.

# Quest: Can we get much higher?
betterquesting.quest.13PWs3MhTUOgkIQq8EKhaQ.name=Can we get much higher?
betterquesting.quest.13PWs3MhTUOgkIQq8EKhaQ.desc=With the EU transfer rates!

# Quest: MV Battery Hulls
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC9g.name=MV Battery Hulls
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC9g.desc=Better machines need better batteries. Let's make some MV battery hulls for new batteries.%n%nIt's up to you what kind of battery to make, but realistically you'll probably make Sodium or Lithium.

# Quest: Single Use Battery: Mercury
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACYw.name=Single Use Battery: Mercury
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACYw.desc=Mercury and acid batteries are single-use batteries. They are crafted fully charged but cannot be re-charged. Once their stored energy is depleted, they can be placed in an extractor to be converted back into small battery hulls.

# Quest: Single Use Battery: Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACZA.name=Single Use Battery: Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACZA.desc=Mercury and acid Batteries are single-use batteries. They are crafted fully charged but cannot be re-charged. Once their stored energy is depleted, they can be placed in an extractor to be converted back into small battery hulls.

# Quest: Reusable Battery: Sodium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACZQ.name=Reusable Battery: Sodium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACZQ.desc=Sodium, cadmium, and lithium batteries are rechargeable batteries. They're crafted without stored energy, but can be charged in any gregtech machine. If unneeded, they can be placed in an extractor and converted back into small battery hulls, but their contents are lost.%n%nIf placed in a machine, it will fill up if there's excess power, and drain if the machine can't get enough. Handy for high-EU machines you don't want to choke.%n%n[note]Sodium is the one that stores the least EU of the 3 rechargeable batteries, but is definitely the easiest to get.[/note]

# Quest: Reusable Battery: Cadmium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACZg.name=Reusable Battery: Cadmium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACZg.desc=This is the Cadmium one.

# Quest: Reusable Battery: Lithium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACZw.name=Reusable Battery: Lithium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACZw.desc=...and the Lithium one.%n%n[note]Lithium is the one that stores the most EU of the 3 rechargeable batteries.[/note]

# Quest: Battery Buffer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaw.name=Battery Buffer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaw.desc=Batteries work pretty much the same in a battery buffer as in a regular machine's battery slot. Battery buffers are used to buffer power to stabilize output.%n%nThey come in different sizes: 1, 4, 9(!) and 16 slots. They can draw 2A and output 1A per battery inserted - watch your wire amperage! Cables come in 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 12x, and 16x, with tin transferring 1A per size. Make sure not to mess up, or your cable will melt, becoming a fire, and possibly an explosion.%n%nRemember that there's loss when outputting EU from any GT machine, so putting 4 4-slot ones in a row loses 8 power compared to 2 from 1 16-slot one. And this is for every amp too.%n%n[note]You can import batteries into one, but ONLY empty acid batteries can be exported from one. No, you can't get around this.[/note]

# Quest: 16 Slot LV Battery Buffer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACmA.name=16 Slot LV Battery Buffer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACmA.desc=Upgrade your battery buffer to hold 16 batteries for primary storage.%n%nYou can use different buffers - probably with fewer batteries - for your EBF, Arc Furnace, Thermal Centrifuge, and so on.

# Quest: Energy Crystals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADFQ.name=Energy Crystals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADFQ.desc=Make energium out of ruby and redstone dusts in the MV mixer. Then use the autoclave to make Energy Crystals. Energy crystals can store 1 million EU and work as an HV battery.

# Quest: Lapotron Crystal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADJg.name=Lapotron Crystal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADJg.desc=With your new HV mixer you can make lapotron dust. Place it in an autoclave to make some raw lapotron crystals. With an EV assembler and advanced circuits you can make lapotron crystals which store up to 10 million EU.

# Quest: EV Battery Buffer

# Quest: EV Sunnarium Battery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE8A.name=EV Sunnarium Battery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE8A.desc=Small Sunnarium batteries are EV tier. Some might think they're cheaper than Lapotrons, but it depends on Sunnarium. And they hold less energy.

# Quest: EV GT++ Batteries
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE8Q.name=EV GT++ Batteries
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE8Q.desc=Want cheaper EV batteries? Mash your old ones together, and somehow it works!

# Quest: Low Voltage Transformer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE8g.name=Low Voltage Transformer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE8g.desc=It is possible to run MV machines while still in LV - build a transformer and use 4 power sources 32 eu/t to power one 128 eu/t machine.%n%nIt transforms power up or down, depending on the mode, which you can switch with a soft mallet. Step-up means 4A LV in, 1A MV out, while step-down means the reverse.%n%nMake sure you understand the following if you prefer your base not being a crater:%nA step-down mode is the default one. In this mode, the large dot is the input. In a step-up mode, it's the output. Do not mix it up. LV machines that receive MV power will explode.%n%nIf the transformer is connected to power, or was in the past, then do not change the mode with stuff connected. It's better to break and place it again to get rid of the stored power rather than rotate it with the wrench and blow things up. Make sure to also disconnect the nearby wires with a wire cutter.%n%nAs a reminder, machines don't blow up if they are given more amps than they can consume. They blow up from higher voltage tier.

# Quest: Medium Voltage Transformer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE8w.name=Medium Voltage Transformer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE8w.desc=These work the same as the LV ones, but 1 tier higher.

# Quest: LV High-Amp Transformer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE9A.name=LV High-Amp Transformer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE9A.desc=If you need a transformer with more than 4A you need a high amp transformer. You can input 4A MV and output 16A LV. Useful for running lots of LV machines. Its mode can be changed with a soft mallet, just like before.

# Quest: Low Voltage Power Transformer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE9Q.name=Low Voltage Power Transformer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE9Q.desc=If you need even more amps then craft a power transformer. This one is 16A -> 64A. The soft mallet is still how you change modes.

# Quest: EU packets flowing everywhere...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFig.name=EU packets flowing everywhere...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFig.desc=...in my dreams. What if instead of having battery packs on every generator, we could centralize all the generation in one location? Put it away from the well traveled parts of the base? Out in the country somewhere? Let the animals deal with the pollution. Anyways, let's start working on a Power Sub-Station to store EU and deliver it to our base.

# Quest: Who Cares About a Little Cancer...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFiw.name=Who Cares About a Little Cancer...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFiw.desc=...when it means you don't have to strip naked to recharge your nanosuit?%nThe Wireless Charger will keep your armor and tools charged up without having to put them into a battery buffer.%n%nIt will charge armor and tools at the tier and below.%n%nYou didn't want kids anyways...

# Quest: Lapotronic Energy Storage Unit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHA.name=Lapotronic Energy Storage Unit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHA.desc=The L.E.S.U. is one of the oldest machines still available in GregTech. Its origins are in Minecraft 1.3.X but has been redone to fit into this modpack. You can add a nearly infinite number of LESU casings to it and you'll have a huge Energy Storage. You might also live inside your Battery.%n%n[note]PS: It sucks, don't make it. Maybe somebody will rework or buff it some day.[/note]

# Quest: Manual Transformer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHg.name=Manual Transformer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHg.desc=Annoyed by building chains of transformers? Don't want an Explosion Risk at your base? Want to use these fancy 64A Hatches and Dynamos from TecTech to convert your power? Make a Manual Dynamo and convert it all!%n%n[note]Also needs a muffler, energy hatch, and dynamo. Not guaranteed to work, wishing you all the best though.[/note]

# Quest: L.E.S.U. Upgrade - LV Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHIQ.name=L.E.S.U. Upgrade - LV Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHIQ.desc=Adding this many Cells anywhere to your LESU will upgrade it from ULV to LV.

# Quest: L.E.S.U. Upgrade - MV Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHIg.name=L.E.S.U. Upgrade - MV Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHIg.desc=Adding an additional amount of Cells will not only cause your storage capacity to rise, but also will enable MV Voltage.

# Quest: L.E.S.U. Upgrade - HV Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHIw.name=L.E.S.U. Upgrade - HV Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHIw.desc=The HV Tier upgrade first needs over a Stack of Casings. More Casings, more Energy, more Capacity.

# Quest: L.E.S.U. Upgrade - EV Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHJA.name=L.E.S.U. Upgrade - EV Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHJA.desc=Close to 8 Stacks of LESU Casings, this upgrade enables EV Voltage on your LESU. It's easy until now.

# Quest: L.E.S.U. Upgrade - IV Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHJQ.name=L.E.S.U. Upgrade - IV Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHJQ.desc=24 Stacks of LESU Casings. These do fit in your Inventory, but crafting them is another problem.%n%n[note]If you don't want to clear out your inventory, just check the box when you have enough.[/note]

# Quest: L.E.S.U. Upgrade - LuV Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHJg.name=L.E.S.U. Upgrade - LuV Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHJg.desc=To reach the highest Voltage Tier the LESU can offer, you need to add an additional amount of LESU Casings. 8193 Casings in total (all upgrades below and these additional) enable the LuV Input Voltage. To submit these you'll need to use the Submit Station from the Steam Tab, since your inventory isn't big enough to hold 96 Stacks.%n%n[note]I mean you could do that, but maybe just check the box once your autocrafting is done.[/note]

# Quest: Transformers, Roll Out!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHgg.name=Transformers, Roll Out!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHgg.desc=When you get to HV you'll want to start thinking about centralizing power generation and delivering power over longer distances. An HV to EV transformer will let you send power across your base without too much penalty.

# Quest: Not Enough Amps?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHgw.name=Not Enough Amps?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHgw.desc=How about 4x more? A Hi-Amp transformer will transform 4A to 16A. Great for setting up a large power grid and locating polluting power generators further from your base.

# Quest: More Than 4 Amps? Crazy!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHhA.name=More Than 4 Amps? Crazy!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHhA.desc=For the truly insane, there is a 16 to 64 A power amp transformer. Just ludicrous!

# Quest: Energy Buffers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIAQ.name=Energy Buffers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIAQ.desc=Your research into energy has led you to energy buffers - a single block that can store enormous amounts, and is also portable. Better than a battery, these devices can be configured to output 1-16A. Using a high-amp transformer, that means you can up tier 2 tiers with these devices. This HV energy buffer can power an HV machine for several hours, or an EV machine for almost an hour. Perfect for mining operations in far off dimensions.

# Quest: Engraved Lapotrons
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIZA.name=Engraved Lapotrons
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIZA.desc=IV tier batteries require a large investment. First, you will need to laser engrave 8 Lapotrons.

# Quest: Lapotronic Energy Orb

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIZQ.desc=The Lapotronic Energy Orb is the IV tier battery item. It can store 100M EU.

# Quest: One BILLION EU
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIZg.name=One BILLION EU
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIZg.desc=If you want a stationary battery, you can make an AFSU capable of storing up to 1 billion EU and charging items. You can pick it up with a wrench, but you'll lose a percentage of the stored EU. Make sure you right-click, not left-click. Left-clicking will cause it to lose all stored EU.%n%nAs an alternative, if you can afford them, try the GT++ Energy Buffers. They are more expensive and cannot charge items, but store more, don't lose any EU, and can be configured from 1-16A. See the GT++ tab for details.%n%n[note]These can apparently draw infinite amps, so maybe use a diode or something if you like having the power on.[/note]

# Quest: Storage of the Gods
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKGg.name=Storage of the Gods
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKGg.desc=Who needs a PSS when this bad boy holds over 600,000x as much.

# Quest: LSC = MC^2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKjA.name=LSC = MC^2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKjA.desc=This is the final upgrade to the LSC when it comes to storage. You can use either the Ultimate or Really Ultimate batteries to craft it, it costs about the same either way.

# Quest: Take charge!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKrA.name=Take charge!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKrA.desc=The Lapotronic Supercapacitor is your best option for massive power storage.%n%nIt can have maintenance issues which increase its power loss by 20%% more each, so try not to let that slide. Though at most it's still only 2.2%%%n%nFor the first, smallest one, you'll need the following, plus an Energy Hatch and a Dynamo. Remember that you can get your Lapos back if you run the capacitor through an unpackager. Finally a reason to make one!%n%nYou can use Laser Hatches, that can output very high amperage. You need at least UV Glass to use them.%n%nYour LSC can hold between 300 MEU and 25.38 GEU using only the EV capacitors. Remember that you need more than half the blocks to be non-empty capacitors for it to be valid.

# Quest: Lapotronic Capacitor (LuV)
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKrQ.name=Lapotronic Capacitor (LuV)
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKrQ.desc=It holds more than the previous tier, other than that there is no difference. Your LSC can hold between 54B and 810B EU with these.

# Quest: Lapotronic Capacitor (ZPM)
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKrg.name=Lapotronic Capacitor (ZPM)
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKrg.desc=It holds more than the previous tier, other than that there is no difference. Your LSC can hold between 540B and 8.1T EU with these.%n%n[note]Requires EV-tier Glass.[/note]

# Quest: Infinite Energy Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALmw.name=Infinite Energy Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALmw.desc=You shouldn't click on links from strangers! Although this sounds like clickbait it is true. From a certain point of view.%n%nUse the (potential) force! And store energy that way. Simply construct a dam and flood vast areas with water. You may add energy to your storage by pumping more water into it or just drain it back into energy whenever you need. This works especially well with fluctuating energy sources like wind, water, and solar. Or you dump excess energy into it so you can use it another time. The capacity is huge and the choice is yours.%n%nSounds great! But...? - Indeed. There is a catch: Pumps and Turbines will have efficiency correlated loss. Still interested? Let's get to crafting!%n%nThe multi-block has an unusual shape: the back is open. The lake will spawn inside the multi-block and spread block-by-block as far as it can/is allowed. It will replace plants like water (make sure to secure your IC2 Crops!) but not replace any solid blocks. Additionally, you can specify limits in any direction. The water will NEVER spread past these limits. You can set those limits in a second GUI by right-clicking the controller with a screwdriver.%n%nWhen you enter a limit, it will correct itself to the nearest valid setting. Especially if you try to spread past the server limits. You may talk your admin into raising these limits (these limits are designed to limit griefing). Further, water is not able to spread into foreign towns.%nYou will also find 3 magical buttons in the top-right of this GUI. From left to right: The first will slowly despawn the lake blocks. You can use this to shrink the lake if it spread past a barrier for example. The multi-block will also initialize with this configuration so there is no accidental flooding. The second and third buttons will slowly spawn more lake blocks. Additionally, the second button will render those lake blocks pink so you see where they are so you may plug holes and such. In this "debug" mode you can walk/breathe/act in the lake like in air. This should make it easy to create a sunken village for decoration purposes. The third button is for normal operations so you can see the water and enjoy a swim in your energy buffer.%n%nOf course, there is also a normal GUI (simple right-click). It shows you the energy stored in the dam. To reach higher water levels you are required to use stronger pumps. For this purpose, you may configure the voltage tier of the GUI with a circuit in the circuit slot. Don't worry: It is only optical. You cannot void any energy if you set a low voltage tier. It is only for the player information. You may give it a try with the reward you earn...%n%nIf you have any further questions, find missing information, or have suggestions please do not hesitate to post on the official GT New Horizons Discord. Please add '@SinTh0r4s' to your post to make sure I'll see it.%n%n[warn]A warning though: there have been a lot of mentions of bugs and even world corruptions caused by the Hydro Dam. Use at your own risk. If you have more detailed information, please report these problems on the GTNH GitHub.[/warn]

# Quest: Gotta Pump It Up
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALnA.name=Gotta Pump It Up
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALnA.desc=If you made it this far you may have already noticed that you cannot pour vanilla water into the dam. That's what a HydroEnergy Pump is for. This multi-block exists in multiple tiers and will allow you to reach higher water levels (= more energy capacity). Provide the pump with vanilla water as input and pipe the fluid output into the dam. Then the dam will slowly fill up. If the dam is full or full for a pump's voltage tier, it will void the water and energy.%n%nThat's all folks! Nothing too fancy here.

# Quest: Let it flow, let it floww ...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALnQ.name=Let it flow, let it floww ...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALnQ.desc=... can't hold it back anymore. It is time to collect the rewards of your hard work. Connect the fluid output hatch from the dam to the fluid input hatch of this turbine and finally enjoy the power! You can pause this multiblock if you cut the fluid input or use a machine controller. Oh, and you will get your water back in the fluid output hatch.%n%nCongratulations to making it this far! Enjoy your ginormous energy buffer!%n%nIf you have any further questions, missing information or suggestions please do not hesitate to post on the official GT New Horizons Discord. Please add '@SinTh0r4s' to your post to make sure I'll see it.

# Quest: Extremely Ultimate and Ultimately Extreme

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM3w.desc=An even more expensive capacitor but it has the same storage? You are reading that right. But it has much faster transfer rates to your wireless power network!

# Quest: Wireless Power!?
betterquesting.quest.Dif-0NSERYGdGP7j8xAzPQ.name=Wireless Power!?
betterquesting.quest.Dif-0NSERYGdGP7j8xAzPQ.desc=Are you sick and tired of having cables all around your base? Are you tired of having to upgrade your cables constantly to handle different amperage amounts? Are you a fan of lightning bolts zapping around your base?%n%nThen this multiblock is for you, the Telsa Tower comes with high amperage output and full TecTech energy hatch support with this powerful multiblock.%n%nTo get started you will need to fill the tower with capacitors matching the tier of the Primary Tesla Windings within the capacitor bank. The Tesla Winding determines the tier of power that the tower transfers power at and the amount of capacitors determines the maximum amperage that can be output.%n%nA total of 16 capacitors can be placed into one capacitor bank so you might need many banks depending on your power needs.%n%nOnce the tower is constructed click open the controller to configure the maximum transfer distance of the tower to fit the needs of your base. The range setting is currently buggy which means that at least for now you can do so without needing any plasmas. This option is called “Tesla Towers Transfer Radius Setting”.%n%nNow that your tower is all configured how do you get power out of it to your machines? Well I am glad you asked. To get power to the machines of the base you will need to use the Tesla Coil Covers. Place them on your machines, energy hatches and even transformers to get power flowing from the tower. Energy hatches are a bit picky however and the hatch likes to be facing upwards to receive power.%n%n[warn]Warning! The Tesla Tower will output only one tier of amp such as EV, IV etc. When upgrading the Primary Tesla Windings, please make sure to check that all of your coil covers and transceivers in the base can handle the upgraded power. Failure to do so will result in a machine explosion.[/warn]%n%n[warn]Failure to turn off the controller before adjustment can also cause an explosion.[/warn]

## Quest Line: Working with Oil
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADw.name=Working with Oil
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADw.desc=A questline about oil refining, oil byproducts, and oil based power generation.

# Quest: Maxed Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0A.name=Maxed Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0A.desc=How many oils have you cracked at this point? No matter the number, you can do it cheaper. Once you reach HSS-G coils, you will have achieved the maximum EU/t discount of 50%% on your Oil Crackers, and enjoy the full array of benefits that they can provide you. Don't forget to overclock them if they're running slow, the energy cost is minimal at this point.

# Quest: Super Fuel At The Top
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0Q.name=Super Fuel At The Top
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0Q.desc=I was kidding, there's one more step in Oil, but it isn't really a better fuel, it's just the Tungstensteel Boiler.%n%nThis multi operates in the same fashion as the Titanium one. It needs a Super Fuel, it produces Superheated Steam and it makes you build a bunch of Steam Turbines to actually get power out of the fuel it consumes. The output energy of a single one of these boilers, at 100%% efficiency, is 16k EU/t, so you'll need many turbines per boiler. You can build them like that, if you wish to, but at this point the Loose mode on those turbines is really useful. The efficiency hit is big, yes, but the Tungstensteel Boiler is 300%% as efficient as the Bronze one, and a single Magic Solid Super Fuel burns for 4,5M EU at 100%% turbine efficiency. Look at the amount of CBD you need to make one super fuel, and then you can decide if you want to tackle this super finale.%n%nYes, it's the end, basically. There are a couple of things you can still do, but I'll give you this as an award for having pushed through essentially all the Oil content in the pack. It has been a long journey, and I hope that you found it worthwhile and enjoyable.

# Quest: Breaking the Mold

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0g.desc=Welcome, o' Baron of Oil. For you who has completed the 5 questlines of oil processing, a new chapter awaits you.%n%nThe following quests are not guidelines on how to work with oil. In reality, they are meant for tiers where you're not supposed to be using this kind of power anymore. However, if you do want to continue it, and push it as far as it can go, the following are a few challenges that you can take on, mostly for bragging rights.%n%nAll these challenges are for the tiers after IV. Some of them are for LuV, others need further progression. Good luck!

# Quest: Ultimate Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0w.name=Ultimate Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0w.desc=The Dangote Distillus is not enough for the goals of an oil baron. You might have heard about "mega" multiblocks, namely the Mega EBF, but did you know that a Distillation Tower equivalent exists?%n%nIt does the same thing as the Dangote, parallels, but it does 256 at a time, and is much, much bigger than anything you've built so far. My challenge to you is to build a max-height, full-sized Mega Distillation Tower, and come out of your efforts with the biggest multiblock that the pack has to offer. You will need more, much more casings than what the quest asks for, but your inventory is not big enough to hold the full amount that will need to build this monstrosity.

# Quest: Hyperheated Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1A.name=Hyperheated Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1A.desc=If there is someone who found themselves invested in the Large Tungstensteel Boilers, this one is for you. Through the pollution, the multiblock spamming and the chained processing lines you need to get here, you will find that this is a lot of heat for one boiler to handle. Why not make two quad boilers?%n%nYou might be thinking about the number of turbine multis you need to withstand this, but fret not! There are extra large turbines, for the extra large steam enthusiast. You will need twelve turbine items for each multi, and you best bring the best ones you can make! Loose mode is up to you, just go wild with your super fuel.%n%n[warn]You will need an Assembly Line to craft the dynamo needed to complete this quest.[/warn]

# Quest: Universal Fuel Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1Q.name=Universal Fuel Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1Q.desc=This is the most powerful combustion engine that has ever been built. In fact, it's not only that, but also a Gas Turbine and a Rocket Fuel Generator!%n%nThe Universal Chemical Fuel Engine burns fuel with some additives, as did its predecessors, but it runs at a lower efficiency. The 150%% value is a mathematical limit, you cannot reach it without supplying infinite fuel, but this engine compensates by running as fast as fuel is input into it, without the maximum EU/t limitation the others had. The only two things you have to make sure of are that you supply enough Combustion Promoter to keep efficiency up (I'll let you figure the best ratio on your own, but 1:4 promoter:fuel is decent), and that the dynamo can support the EU/t that the generator is outputting.%n%n[warn]You will need an Assembly Line to craft the dynamo needed to complete this quest. You better burn enough HOG to make it worth![/warn]

# Quest: Simple Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqA.name=Simple Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqA.desc=As rich as Oil is, it's hardly useful for anything in this state. One of the most important parts in the processing chain is distillation, which separates the components of this black mixture by the difference in their boiling points. You can do this in a Distillery, starting in LV, but for now only one of the fractions can be obtained at a time: you must choose which one you want.%n%nLighter fractions are generally more useful than heavier ones, but that doesn't mean that lightest is best. For now, going for Sulfuric Light Fuel is the best option, since it will become a good source of power after being treated. Don't use unprocessed oil to power these machines, stick to Steam until you can use something better.%n%n[note]You can find info about the other fractions in the LV tab![/note]

# Quest: Oil Drilling Rig
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqw.name=Oil Drilling Rig
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqw.desc=In the MV tier, Oil gets a big boost in its effectiveness, and becomes a fantastic powergen option for anyone wanting to switch off Steam, if they haven't done it already. It becomes difficult to use Steam as the only power source in this tier, so you should find a more reliable way to get power.%n%nOf course, you might already be using Light Fuel as your power source of choice, but a different question might have popped up in your mind by now: is there a better way to get Oil? Perhaps you have run short, or perhaps not. Either way, there is a multi unlocked in this tier that can greatly facilitate the automation of Oil input into your Distillery. That multi is the Oil Drilling Rig, which can pump it from below bedrock, but only if there is some in the current chunk, which means that you will have to scan the chunks around you to find it.%n%nThere is a quest for this rig in the Multiblock Goals tab. Go check it out!

# Quest: Distillation Tower
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrA.name=Distillation Tower
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrA.desc=In HV, your oil processing options soar to new levels of complexity, and efficiency. Many of the processing multis that can be used are unlocked in this tier, and one of the most iconic is the Distillation Tower, the direct upgrade of the Distillery.%n%nThis tower can do actual fractional distillation, a process used in real life petrochemistry to separate oil into many different parts, based on their boiling points. The tall structure is required for the process, because the condensation of the vapors occurs in different temperatures. And since heating is only applied at the bottom, temperature drops the higher the vapor travels. This means that compounds with higher boiling points will condense sooner and will end up lower in the column, the opposite is also applicable for compounds with low boiling points.%n%nThat said, the Distillation Tower replaces Distilleries by allowing you to collect all fractions at once, from the same amount of input. This means that the tower is both more efficient, and also allows automation of all the outputs at the same time, but this comes at a cost: the controller needs EV circuits, which require a built Cleanroom, and the structure blocks are mostly made of Stainless Steel. Not only that, but the tower's height depends on the recipe, since each output needs its own height level to successfully be extracted. A max-height, 12-block tall DT can cost almost a dozen stacks of stainless to build, a very expensive multi for the tier.%n%nInstead of doing that, the first DT you should build is a 5-block tall one, to distill the Oil you're pumping out of reservoirs. Doing this, you can get all the fractions at once, for a reasonably cheap multi, compared to its maximum size.

# Quest: The Era of Multis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrQ.name=The Era of Multis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrQ.desc=What does this mean, "the era of multis"? I've built so many multis already!%n%nWell, yes, but now it's all multiblocks. There are still singleblock machines for all the tasks they're needed for, but at IV the newer GT++ multis become available, or at least most of them, which can do the same jobs of bending, extruding, extracting, amongst others, but with higher initial investments and many bonuses to their processing. Remember what I said before about higher initial investments being worth it?%n%nThat said, there isn't a new oil processing chain in IV, you only improve what you already have. If there was a step in the chain that was running too slow, and you needed to add more machines to it or overclock, it's likely that there is now a multi that can take over that role by itself. Tungstensteel is usually an important part of these things, so get it automated in anticipation of what's to come.

# Quest: Generator Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrg.name=Generator Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrg.desc=Welcome to EV! If you thought the previous tier had a big jump in oil processing, you are correct, but now it's going to jump up all over again!%n%nThis tier does not unlock new processing multis like HV did, but it does bring better, much better generators. From now on, your main generators options will almost always be multiblocks, unless you need an easy-to-move generator for a multiblock miner or something similar. For your diesel fuels, the next step is the Large Combustion Engine (LCE), and there is a quest for it on the Multiblock Goals tab as usual. This, however, is a big investment in Titanium, amongst other things, so I hope you have that processing automated already.%n%nIf you boost the LCE, you will get both a huge boost in EU/t and efficiency. While an HV Diesel Generator had an output of 512 EU/t at 85%% efficiency, this expensive multi outputs 6144 EU/t at 150%% efficiency! Make sure you have an EV Buffered Dynamo Hatch that can handle this output.%nThere is an equivalent turbine for gases, like the Refinery Gas you might be using to power your oil processing setup, which is cheaper to build but its performance depends on the turbine placed inside it, and you won't be able to get near the levels of the LCE unless you get some Tungstensteel, and a good metal like Shadow Metal.

# Quest: Desulfurizing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrw.name=Desulfurizing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrw.desc=After distillation, the fluid you got still isn't that good. It can be used for power, but it's almost as bad as Oil itself unless you remove the sulfuric content it has. This applies for all the portions that can be distilled from Oil, and as such it's a required step regardless of which one you're working with.%n%nTo get clean Light Fuel, the sulfur needs to be drawn out with something that reacts with it, in a Chemical Reactor. What you need is Hydrogen, a relatively common gas that can be electrolyzed from water, or from specific ores (check NEI for all the possible sources). After reacting, you will get Hydrogen Sulfide and the clean Light Fuel, which can be further processed or burned for power at this stage.

# Quest: Light Fuel Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsA.name=Light Fuel Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsA.desc=Light Fuel is a great power source in LV, for several reasons. Not only is it much more power-dense than Steam, which means that you need a smaller amount of it to get the same EU amount, but the generators that can burn it have a higher fuel efficiency than the Steam ones. Even wooden fluid pipes will be enough to transport this fuel!%n%nThat said, your old generators will not accept Light Fuel, so you will have to make some Combustion Generators to get power out of it. You'll still get one LV amp out of each, which means you might have to make more if you are running several machines at once. By the time you build your first Electric Blast Furnace, you will want 4 of these feeding it power.

# Quest: Basic Cracking
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsQ.name=Basic Cracking
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsQ.desc=Despite what the Distillery recipe might have led you to believe, there are many more fractions of Oil than the four you could choose from. However, to get the rest of the oil byproducts, you need to split these four into the others, a process known as cracking. To crack the fuels, they must not be sulfuric, and you will need either Hydrogen (hydro-cracking) or Steam (steam-cracking) to successfully crack. Your Hydrogen source for desulfurizing is hopefully good enough to sustain hydro-cracking, and the Steam you were previously using for power can now be useful to get more out of the Oil you're pumping.%n%nHeavy Fuel, Light Fuel, Refinery Gas and Naphtha can each be cracked both ways, and with three different intensities: lightly, moderately or severely cracked. This means that each portion has 6 different cracking options, and the products of distilling them can be cracked once more! There are a lot of options here, but a few of them stand out for their usefulness.%n%nThe first one you should try is Refinery Gas. In order to make that, you will need to desulfurize Sulfuric Gas, so make some of that in your Distillery. Currently, you can only crack through the Chemical Reactor, so once you have the Refinery Gas grab some steam and get cracking.%n%n*Hint* You should start by making some Severely-Cracked Refinery Gas%n%n[note]Make x5 as many cells if you don't want to waste anything.[/note]

# Quest: Early Ethylene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsg.name=Early Ethylene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsg.desc=In LV, cracking fuels is only possible in a Chemical Reactor, which has a lower efficiency than the Oil Cracker multiblock that is available at HV. That said, it is still a great source of some fluids, one of which being Ethylene, the precursor to Polyethylene, the first plastic that can be produced and a required part of progression in the pack. To obtain Ethylene from Oil, the best way to go is to severely steam-crack Refinery Gas.%n%nSimply put the Refinery Gas and the Steam in a Chemical Reactor with the correct circuit (check NEI) and then distill the cracked Refinery Gas. It can give a lot of different outputs, so make sure you choose the right one. After doing this, you'll have successfully processed Oil, both for power and for byproducts. Congratulations!%n%n[note]After you unlock different types of oil from underground fluids at MV the best route to ethylene may change depending on what type of oil you will decide to extract.[/note]

# Quest: Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsw.name=Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsw.desc=This sulfuric waste that came out of the oil fractions could be voided, but it's actually a useful byproduct for your progression. The Hydrogen Sulfide that you obtained, mixed with Water in another Chemical Reactor will give back Diluted Sulfuric Acid, which can be turned into its more concentrated form by distilling it.%n%nSulfuric Acid is one of the most important chemicals in the pack, so make sure to use this opportunity to automate it. It's needed for circuits, amongst other things, so you will need a lot of it.

# Quest: Oil Reservoirs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtA.name=Oil Reservoirs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtA.desc=Unlike the oil spouts that are visible on the surface, the underground reservoirs cannot be seen or measured without the use of specific tools.%nThe main quest for prospecting "Analyzing the Soil" is in the LV tab.

# Quest: More Hydrogen
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtQ.name=More Hydrogen
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtQ.desc=With more Oil in your hands, you are sure to have problems with the other inputs you need. Hydrogen is required to get any type of clean byproduct, and the amount you need scales with the speed at which your Chemical Reactors work. It is possible to get a lot of it from ores, and mining out a Limonite vein will get you enough to last a long while, but it will eventually run out. Which automatic sources can you choose from?%n%nThe simplest option is to electrolyze water. You can just keep feeding water for free, but it's a slow and inefficient process, although it also gives you Oxygen. You will need a few Electrolyzers running to keep it going at a decent pace.%n%nAn alternative option is to do this, but with salt water, obtained from Salty Root, if you have delved into IC2 crops. You will also get Chlorine that you will need very often in the next two tiers.%n%nLastly, did you know that most of the oil byproducts are organic compounds, and as such are made mostly of Carbon and Hydrogen? You can electrolyze most of them to get these elements, at a faster rate than water, but only if you have leftovers. Methane is one of the choices that you might have stockpiling. However, note that these byproducts often have fuel values and it's often better to use them as fuel to then electrolyze (salt) water.%n%nEither way, you will need Electrolyzers. Build at least an MV one to continue!

# Quest: Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtg.name=Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtg.desc=There is a better way to get fuel from Oil in MV, but you will need to expand into other fractions instead of just using Light Fuel. The next step is Diesel, and it is a mix of 5 buckets of Light Fuel with 1 bucket of Heavy Fuel, turning into 6 buckets of Diesel that each have a higher fuel value than the fuel used in LV.%n%nTo automate this from regular Oil, you will need another Distillery and Chemical Reactor, and finally a Mixer to put the fuels together. There are other possible sources of Heavy Fuel, mentioned on another quest in this chain, which can be of assistance if the input of Oil into the setup isn't very high. You will also need more Hydrogen, so get on it!

# Quest: Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtw.name=Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtw.desc=Finally, the oil of the gods. At least, early gods.%n%nDiesel, as a power source, has widely been known as the optimal choice all the way up to EV, when you unlock the ability to make nukes. It can be further upgraded into Cetane-Boosted Diesel in HV, by adding another chemical chain to it, but a fuel value of 480k EU on a fuel that needs so few machines to be made is quite exceptional. It should be automated as soon as possible, to ensure that you won't run out of power when you need it the most.%n%nAt this stage, you can use either LV or MV Diesel Generators. Using the LV ones will mean you need to make more of them, and more pollution, but they have 95%% fuel efficiency compared to MV's 90%%. It's a difference, but an automated Diesel setup is unlikely to be affected by a 5%% change in efficiency.%n%nAs you progress, fuel will become more and more power-dense, but also need more steps automated. The next tier is much harder than this one, so get ready!

# Quest: More Oil Options
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuA.name=More Oil Options
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuA.desc=Alongside the Oil Drilling Rig, there are other sources you can explore. For Heavy Oil, a good source might be Oilsands Ore, which is found in rare veins at high altitudes. If you find one, you will have a large amount of Heavy Fuel to make Diesel with after processing.%n%nThere are also renewable sources of Oil, namely from IC2 crops and bees. The Oilberry crop can produce it indefinitely, but at a very slow rate, whereas bees can do it much faster, particularly Refined Bees, but they are much harder to obtain.%n%nYou can also get more out of the Oil by cracking it in specific ways. Lightly Hydrocracked Heavy Fuel, for example, gives 60%% of the input amount as Light Fuel, which can be helpful if you have an excess of Heavy, and not enough Light to make Diesel.

# Quest: Using All the Fractions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuQ.name=Using All the Fractions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuQ.desc=After getting large amounts of all the oil fractions, what can you do with them? They'll pile up in the tanks or output hatches, and the Distillation Tower stops when it fills up, unless you enable fluid voiding in the controller - in which case everything that cannot be output will just be voided instead, and it's in your best interest to avoid this waste. What do, then?%n%nFirst off, it's important to note that almost everything you get from Oil can be processed into even more things. Whether or not the step is worthwhile is a different story altogether. That said, you're free to look through NEI or the spreadsheet to decide what you want to do, and how you want to do it. The charm of a processing chain like this is that it lets you choose your own path and gives you the information to know how to best utilize it.%n%nSecond off, Oil is a major source of byproducts, many of which are needed to create various important materials. However, this isn't the only way to obtain most of them, and you might already found other sources, especially if you've dabbled in the Benzene or the Biomass chains. Which path you take is up to you.%n%nNow, for the four fractions that you get from regular Oil. Up until now, the power generation needed both Light Fuel and Heavy Fuel processing, and Refinery Gas already proved to be a good source of Ethylene. What can these be used for, in case you can build more DTs to process the cracked fluids? Roughly speaking, these are the possibilities:%n%nLight Fuel: You will most likely be using most, or all of this to make Diesel. If you do have leftovers, moderately hydrocracking it is a good source of Propene, and lightly hydrocracking is the best source for Octane. These two are important, but only in EV, for epoxy and powergen, specifically.%n%nHeavy Fuel: If only working with regular Oil, a lot of this will also be consumed to make Diesel. However, it's important to get more of it automated, since it can be distilled directly to make three fantastic byproducts: Toluene, Phenol and Benzene. All of them are important for progression, so make sure you pay attention to this recipe. Toluene is especially useful in HV, as you will need many buckets of it when making your first rocket to be able to get into EV.%n%nNaphtha: You could distill it in a Distillation Tower, but keep in mind that you need to build a max-height one to cover the entire recipe. However, if you do it, you will have most of the Oil byproducts automated meaning that it's worth it to tackle this challenge when you get comfortable with making lots of Stainless Steel; it also has a good burn value, so if you don't need these byproducts, it's best to just use it for power.%n%nRefinery Gas: You're probably already distilling this for Ethylene. You could switch this recipe to a Distillation Tower and an Oil Cracking Unit (see next quest) to gain more output and some useful byproducts.

# Quest: Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALug.name=Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALug.desc=Another HV multi, and another Stainless Steel sink. Not only that, but it needs 16 coils to work! There is a quest about this multi in the Multiblock Goals tab, as per usual.%n%nDespite being expensive, this is an important multiblock to build. It does the cracking recipes like the Chemical Reactor does, and you might even be tempted to make an LCR for this purpose, since it's cheap and can do many recipes at once, but the Oil Cracker is much more efficient and gives several bonuses when used (check the tooltip for more information). As it stands, it's a higher initial investment that will pay off in the long run, many times over, and in this pack everything takes a long time, so get on it!

# Quest: Boosting the Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuw.name=Boosting the Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuw.desc=As you might have guessed, extra byproducts is not the only thing that HV does with Oil. On top of that, you can further improve the main fuel that you use for power, and this builds on the previous tier, as Diesel did from Light Fuel. As before, you will need to mix the fuel you have with something else to improve it, but it is not a direct byproduct this time. Instead, it's a chemical that requires a complicated processing chain to produce, at a much higher EU cost, with only a tiny amount needed to create the next fuel, Cetane-Boosted Diesel.%n%nTo make this additive, Tetranitromethane (TNM), you will need to source several chemicals you might have not used yet. I hope you have some Distillation Towers handy, because they will be very useful for this.

# Quest: Special Rubber from Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvA.name=Special Rubber from Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvA.desc=Another one of the Oil "specials" is Butadiene. It can be used in a few ways, including power, but where it shines is in making advanced rubber, specifically Styrene-Butadiene Rubber. You can make it in HV, but it is not required to have an improved rubber until the start of IV. There is a questline for this in the HV tab, so go check it out.%n%nThere is an equivalent alternative, Silicone Rubber, made from other inputs. They are mostly interchangeable, but they each have some unique use that makes it so you should have a good supply of both.

# Quest: Distilled Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvQ.name=Distilled Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvQ.desc=You don't always have to crack the base fuels to get useful chemicals out of them. The best example of this is Heavy Fuel, whose recipe only has 3 outputs, but they're all excellent. This is the perfect format for a Distillation Tower automation, so get on it as soon as you can, you won't regret it!%n%nAs a sidenote, all of these are power-dense, and can be used for power if you stockpile a lot of them. Benzene is the first one you should use for this purpose, if you wish to do it, because the other two are core chemicals for required progression in HV and EV. However, Benzene can also turn into several useful chemicals, so don't burn it all for power.

# Quest: Acetone and Ethenone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvg.name=Acetone and Ethenone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvg.desc=Another ingredient in the making of TNM is Ethenone, which can be made directly from Acetone. This one is a little more organic, which is to say it's much easier to automate if you chose Benzene or Biomass. From those routes, you can get it from a Wood Vinegar DT, or reacting Acetic Acid with Calcite Dust from a Fermented Biomass DT (get the calcite from electrolyzing Fertilizer). If you used biomass to get Ammonia, you can do it this way.%n%nIf not using plants, though, there are other ways to automate this. Ethenone can be made directly from Acetic Acid and Sulfuric Acid, and this last one should already be automated from cleaning the sulfuric waste from the oil fractions. Acetic Acid, on the other hand, is a mix of Oxygen and Ethylene, a combo that you might have already automated to make Polyethylene. If not, this is a good time to do so.%n%nThe amount of Ethenone you need to make a lot of Cetane-Boosted Diesel is small, so it's unlikely that you'll run out of Sulfuric Acid for this. Make sure you automate it all, though.

# Quest: Ammonia Source
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvw.name=Ammonia Source
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvw.desc=One of the components of Tetranitromethane is Nitric Acid, which is made from Nitrogen Dioxide, and this from Nitrogen Oxide, which is ultimately created from Ammonia. You can do a small Chemical Reactor chain to do this line of recipes, but the better option is to make an LCR and use the circuit 24 recipe to turn Ammonia and Oxygen directly into Nitric Acid.%n%nYou'll still need to automate Ammonia, though, and there are two main ways of doing this. One of the options is to create it directly from Nitrogen and Hydrogen, but this recipe consumes a lot of EU. The other option is to switch to the biological side of things and get it from the DT recipe of Fermented Biomass, but this requires a whole another setup with sapling automation, a Pyrolyse Oven and some other machines, so don't do it unless you're interested in getting the other outputs of that recipe. It, however, might be a good option if you don't have those yet. Either way, automate your Ammonia.

# Quest: Tetranitromethane as Additive
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwA.name=Tetranitromethane as Additive
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwA.desc=If both Nitric Acid and Ethenone are automated, then you can now get TNM effortlessly!%n%nIf you look at the recipe, you'll see that you need a lot more Nitric Acid than anything else. Given that Ammonia is the most power-hungry recipe, this is what will cut down into the fuel efficiency at the end, but not nearly enough to discourage the creation and use of CBD. Not only that, but if you check the uses of TNM, you'll see that you can treat Biodiesel the same way, although at a higher cost due to its lower fuel value, if you happened to have it.

# Quest: Cetane-Boosted Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwQ.name=Cetane-Boosted Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwQ.desc=If you made it here, then you should be ready to make Cetane-Boosted Diesel flow into your generators by itself. Congratulations!%n%nOil is still the best power option in HV, building up from what you used in LV. This CBD you've made will help fuel your EBFs, get into space and then handle the increased power needs that EV will throw at you, especially if you want to make an AE2 network for quick automation. Your singleblock generators are at the lowest efficiency yet, 85%%, but the fuel you use now has a fuel value of 1 million EU per bucket, a very powerful liquid compared to any other you could make at this time.%n%nI'll see you on EV. Good luck when you make it there.

# Quest: Superpowered Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwg.name=Superpowered Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwg.desc=As did all tiers until now, the EV tier introduces a new type of bigger, better liquid fuel to burn on engines, High-Octane Gasoline. However, this one doesn't use the previous fuel, and instead takes a different oil-based route, which means that the CBD you have is of no use in this processing chain.%n%nAlso as before, the amount of processing you will need is greatly increased, and you can expect to need a lot more DTs, Oil Crackers, LCRs and other machines. You will also have to automate the input of materials from other sources, since Oil cannot provide you with everything anymore. You can overclock the multis you have, or build more of them, your choice. In the end, you'll have a fuel that is 2.5x more powerful than CBD, at an impressive fuel value of 2.5 million EU, and more byproducts than you could ever imagine.%n%nYou might have to crack one of the four oil fractions into the other ones, and you will surely need to pump Oil faster and faster to keep up with the power needs that will come when jumping to IV. I do recommend you use AE2 to automate the setup, relying on fluid P2Ps to transport fluids around, because it will make your life easier, even if it's harder to start and learn the setup. Either way you go, don't forget, you have to automate it.%n%n[warn]Work on making these important EV multis to continue.[/warn]

# Quest: Boiler and Super Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALww.name=Boiler and Super Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALww.desc=With the advancements in building materials you've made until now, a new kind of generator has been unlocked. The Large Boilers you might have looked at before, and perhaps used, change when you reach Titanium, and if you build one of those, you will get something quite different from the tiers before.%n%nTo start, most burnable items don't work here. These advanced boilers need to burn much hotter, and as such they only accept specific fuels. The fuel of interest here is one of two, who are built in a sort of chain, in a similar fashion as to how Diesel and CBD worked. There is Solid Super Fuel, and Magic Solid Super Fuel, and they are both created from some coal-like block, some binder and some liquid fuel. You can use CBD for this, but Heavy Fuel and LPG are also options.%n%nWhy go through this route, though? The answer is that this extra processing, although it is difficult to automate, creates fuel that is much more efficient than the fuels that were put into it, and this is because the advanced Large Boilers are slow burners that output Superheated Steam, instead of regular one. This also means that they will need two turbines to convert all the steam into EU, and even more if the amount produced is too much for them. If fuel efficiency is something you're looking for, you can tackle this challenge and further process your CBD into something even more powerful.

# Quest: Improved Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxA.name=Improved Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxA.desc=Have you built an Oil Cracker? Have you checked its coils? This multi gets a significant discount to EU/t when upgrading the coils, but it caps at TPV, at a maximum of 50%% discount. If you are still using low-tier coils, this is a great time to upgrade them to Nichrome and enjoy a 40%% discount. You could also do TPV directly.%n%nBy the way, you can wall-share Oil Crackers, just like DTs, LCRs and many other multis, and doing this will save on the amount of coils you need!%n%n[note]You only need to do one of the two tasks.[/note]

# Quest: Magic Super Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxQ.name=Magic Super Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxQ.desc=Solid Super Fuel is an excellent fuel to burn in the Titanium Boiler, but you can do something even better than that. With a touch of magic, you can make yet another solid fuel with 50%% more fuel value than the last one, but it's very likely that you will need Thaumcraft progression to automate this fully, should you wish to do so.%n%nIf you do want to do it, I recommend you also find a way to automate Coal, from IC2 crops for example, because the recipes that use it is much more efficient on liquid fuel than the other coals. You will also end up making more boilers, perhaps a quad Titanium Boiler, which will surely force you to increase the amount of Steam Turbines you'll have to make, but there is a catch here: you can use the screwdriver to change the turbine's mode into Loose mode, which significantly decreases their efficiency but boosts their speed by something like 8 times, depending on the turbine you're using. Given that this process already boosts the efficiency of your fuels a lot, you may want to lose some of it to keep your number of turbines low.%n%nI'll leave the planning up to you.

# Quest: Raw Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxg.name=Raw Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxg.desc=At this point, you have almost all the additives needed to transform basic gasoline into the powerful HOG. What you'll need to do next is to create the gasoline itself, and this begins with Raw Gasoline. It has four different inputs, and each of them is sourced in a different way, but none of them are new: Naphtha and Refinery gas are well-known to you, Methanol was created in the previous quest and Acetone was explained in the "Acetone and Ethenone" quest in HV.%n%nAn important detail here is that Raw Gasoline is 80%% Naphtha. It can be obtained in large quantities from raw oil. If you are not pumping raw oil, you will most likely find the amount you get to be short. But this problem has already been solved! Your source of Octane, if processed in a DT as explained, will also crack the Light Fuel into a lot of Naphtha that you can use here to compensate for the low amount you get from Oil. If you get low on Light Fuel, you can also crack Heavy Fuel to get some.

# Quest: Pushing with Anti-Knock Agent
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxw.name=Pushing with Anti-Knock Agent
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxw.desc=If you want your generators to last, you'll want to make this. In fact, since safety is always the priority, you can't make HOG without this Anti-Knock Agent, a mixture that keeps the fuel from damaging the engine even when it is this powerful. There are two paths to get this automated: one with an LCR recipe, and the other with a DT. The LCR option is cheaper to build, as per usual, but it consumes considerably more power than the DT path, so this quest will focus on the latter. As before, having an initial higher investment to save energy in the long run is the way to go.%n%nThe DT path is a cycle between a Mixer and the tower itself, where each distillation extracts a bit of Anti-Knock Agent from the MTBE Reaction Mixture, and will need to be mixed again. The two inputs needed for the setup are Butene and Methanol. Butene is obtainable from any of the max-height DT distillations, and Methanol from a mixture of Hydrogen and Carbon Dioxide/Carbon Monoxide. If you have a Fermented Biomass setup, you will already have CO2 ready to go, and Hydrogen can be sourced from a variety of ways.%n%nMake this cycle, and you'll have a safe fuel.

# Quest: Zooming with Nitrous
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyA.name=Zooming with Nitrous
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyA.desc=Nitrous Oxide, N2O, also known as nitro. It makes cars go really fast for short bursts. In reality, it is a source of extra oxygen when mixed in with the fuel during combustion, allowing it to be consumed faster and also release energy faster, but at the risk of "knocking", detonating the fuel out of its intended boundaries and possibly destroying the engine.%n%nTo avoid this, something else needs to be mixed in this HOG to prevent your generators from exploding, right? Luckily for you, such an option exists and it will be presented after this quest. For now, though, you can focus on automating Nitrous Oxide by mixing Nitrogen with Oxygen. These are the two main products of distilling air, so you can obtain them in one step, but you probably have chosen your source of these gases at this point, so use what you have.

# Quest: Speeding with Octane
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyQ.name=Speeding with Octane
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyQ.desc=One of the components of High-Octane Gasoline, as the name implies, is Octane. It is so important to improve the fuel because of something called "octane rating", which measures how much the fuel resists compression without detonating. The energy that vehicles get to move around comes from this detonation, but being able to apply more compression allows for engine designs that are more efficient, but need the fuel to resist that increased force without detonating. That said, any of these fuels can be run in the engines you use, so the way to represent this efficiency bonus is in the fuel value.%n%n(There is a multi in the next tier that only runs on HOG, though. Don't forget it.)%n%nHow is Octane obtained, then? In the last tier, it was explained as coming from Light Fuel, and this is still how you should, and can obtain it: lightly hydrocracked Light Fuel gives some Octane, so put a DT for it and leave your Diesel needs behind. It's time to move on.

# Quest: Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyg.name=Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyg.desc=Raw Gasoline is raw, obviously. To make it a proper fuel, it needs something explosive mixed in with it... what could you have that is considered explosive? Maybe the TNT, or what it's made of?%n%nYou have Toluene automated already, right? Get on it.

# Quest: High Octane Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyw.name=High Octane Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyw.desc=Gasoline is a regular fuel, as I'm sure you know. Nothing special about it, it's the same as Diesel but with a different density, for different engines. In real life, it's incredibly useful for the average person, but in GTNH it's mostly replaced by Diesel. However, that is about to change.%n%nThis step is by far the most complicated one in the entire chain, but you already automated all the additives you need, so this is just a matter of mixing. This is the EV step, the final step, so put your chemicals together. Add Octane to help the fuel resist compression after putting in the explosive Toluene, mix in the nitrous to juice it up and finish by controlling it with Anti-Knock Agent. Mix this all with Gasoline and you have HOG, the most powerful diesel fuel in the game.%n%nThere is more progression to the oil processing, and more quests from here, but this is it for fuel improvements. What is left for you is unlocking, and building even better generators that can take full advantage of how powerful HOG is. Nuclear Power is likely to be your next step in power, as diesels cannot last forever, but you can still continue through this path.%n%nOh, and congratulations! You have earned this reward.

# Quest: Largest Oil Drain
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzA.name=Largest Oil Drain
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzA.desc=One way or another, you will need to get Oil faster. Reservoirs can get really big, but the rig only pumps from a portion of them... until now. With a few stacks of Tungstensteel, you can put together the tier 4 of the Oil Rigs, and suck up all the fluid from a reservoir at once, covering the full 8x8 chunk size from a single spot.%n%nIf you need even faster Oil input, build more rigs! They'll draw from the same pool, and exhaust it together. If you put them on adjacent reservoir chunks, you can draw multiple full reservoirs at once and feed them into a central location, and this transportation becomes even easier with Ender Tanks, which are unlocked in this tier.

# Quest: Buffered Dynamo
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzQ.name=Buffered Dynamo
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzQ.desc=Another use for a few stacks of Tungstensteel is a new, even more powerful generator, but you can't run it just yet. Just like the LCE before it, the IV generator can't be run without a dynamo hatch that is powerful enough to keep up with the output, and in this case it applies to both the boosted and unboosted modes.%n%nWhat that means is that you need an IV Buffered Dynamo Hatch. The power will be worth it.

# Quest: Extreme Combustion Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzg.name=Extreme Combustion Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzg.desc=Very similar to the LCE in most aspects, the Extreme Combustion Engine was created to close the gap between the diesels and more advanced forms of powergen, mainly nuclear fusion. However, the main thing they differ on is the fuel that they can run, and in this case you're limited to the powerful fuel from the last tier, High Octane Gasoline.%n%nThat's right, only this fuel will work, and in exchange the ECE will output more than 10k EU/t. If you add Liquid Oxygen, which you'll need 4 Vacuum Freezers for (3 at HV and 1 at EV), you can keep it boosted permanently, which will send it up to 4 IV amps of power and 150%% fuel efficiency. It's in your best interest to keep this thing going if you want to keep using Oil fuels for power, and the only thing you can rely on is your automated HOG setup, which you might have to, and should improve with the new IV multis as soon as you can, unless you have other sources of power working simultaneously.%n%nAs a last note, there is also an IV equivalent of the Vacuum Freezer, if you want to tackle the Liquid Oxygen needs that way. It's more power efficient, look it up on the GT++ tab.

# Quest: Super Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzw.name=Super Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzw.desc=Your tallest and closest buddy, the Distillation Tower. You've relied on it so much, haven't you? It's time to take it down.%n%nNo, not really, but you can do better now. The catch is that the upgrade to this, the Dangote Distillus, is special in the sense that its crafting recipe is in the Chemical Plant, and the one you have to build for this recipe is very expensive. Should you decide to accept the costs, though, you can build a Dangote in much the same way as the DT, and even upgrade it to tier 2 for better performance (look in NEI for a Distillus Chip, you have to put it in the controller).%n%nIn summary, this multi runs faster than the DT by doing parallels, a recipe done multiple times at once. A quad DT that you were using to distill Oil can be replaced by a Dangote, and so on. Since distillation is usually a bottleneck in speed for oil processing, this multi should prove useful.


## Quest Line: Bio for the Masses
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFQ.name=Bio for the Masses
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFQ.desc=Questline about powergen that comes from plants and trees.

# Quest: Renewable Energy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFA.name=Renewable Energy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFA.desc=Despite finding oil spouts in the wild, you might have thought about extending the source of power you have used to reach the age of electricity. Steam was your energy, and burnable items your source of that energy, with wood and charcoal being the most likely candidates for automating your first power generation steps. Steam itself, however, is not the best option for all progression tiers, so the question is: what else can that wood do? That is what this questline will explain.%n%nEach tier you reach will challenge you with bigger power needs. Not only do the energy tiers multiply by 4 every time you go up (32 EU/t for LV, 128 for MV, 512 for HV, etc.), but also the necessary growth of your setups, with more steps and each one becoming more complicated. To sustain all this, you might want a fully automated, infinite source of power and chemicals to handle this pack's progression. To achieve this, following the quests in this chapter is sure to be helpful.%n%nAs a final note, the power outputs of a fully renewable powergen like this are not as efficient as oil, which is the price to pay for being renewable. You will need a bigger machine setup to achieve the same EU/t output, but it is still very viable and worth it if you are willing to make this compromise. On the other hand, building these wood-related setups will give you some interesting chemicals to use in later crafts, chemicals that oil cannot directly create. You can choose one or the other, or just follow both paths at the same time if you're curious. It's up to you.

# Quest: Carbon, Chemically
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFQ.name=Carbon, Chemically
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFQ.desc=How does all of this organic stuff produce energy, anyways? You burn it, that's how! The heat from that burning heats up water into Steam, and this can make a Steam Turbine spin, generating rotational energy that can directly be converted into electricity with spinning magnetic fields. Pretty neat, right? The wood/charcoal provides the combustible material, and the atmosphere provides the oxygen to keep the fire going. With some chemistry, and GTNH magic, we can use these principles to generate power in an alternative way.%n%nIt's pretty much magic, really. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a valid fuel for Gas Turbines, and it can be made with Charcoal and Oxygen. The CO has more power than the Charcoal used to make it, but the additional Oxygen will make this step not worth it if you get it from electrolyzing water or centrifuging air, since the EU needed for those crafts will make this process inefficient. There is, however, a more efficient way to automate Oxygen production, but you will need crops for it.%n%nYour target is Sugar and an MV Electrolyzer. This will give you Oxygen at almost 1000 EU per bucket. Each bucket of CO produces 24000 EU, made from one Charcoal that produces roughly 16000 EU in Steam, and costing 560 EU per craft. The whole process gives around 6000 EU of free power per Charcoal, around 30%% extra power overall!%n%nTo get automated Sugar from crops, you want Sugar Beets. Sugar Canes do the same thing, but with more EU cost to get the Sugar. There are other possible ways but, for now, just get loads of Sugar.

# Quest: Burning the Carbon
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFg.name=Burning the Carbon
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFg.desc=If you've automated Carbon Monoxide, you can now burn it directly for EU in a Gas Turbine. It does not use the Steam Turbines that the boilers required, which is a good thing for two reasons: Steam Turbines are less fuel efficient than their Gas or Combustion alternatives, and steam in itself needs large pipes to move it, being much less power dense than gases or diesels. Additionally, you don't even need boilers at all! You can skip them altogether if you invest in this CO route.%n%nYou also get Ashes from this chemical reaction. They can be used in several ways, take a look!

# Quest: Sourcing Your Wood
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFw.name=Sourcing Your Wood
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFw.desc=When it comes to power from wood, your only options so far have been the wood itself and Charcoal. Both of these are low on energy per item, so you will need a lot of wood to have a decent EU/t output. How, then, can you easily get that much? There are two ways: the automated way, and the non-automated way.%n%nThe automated way can be done with one of several machines, but in LV you only have one option: the LV Crop Manager. It can automatically harvest crops in an area around it and, for this situation, the crop you want is one of several Bonsais. You can get them by planting saplings on cropsticks (there is a lot more information about how crops work in the Forestry and Multifarms page), and most types of saplings are equivalent to one another, although not all of them can be planted as crops. The ones that stand out are Spruce, which give a bit more wood than the others, and Oak, which give Apples alongside the usual wood and saplings, possibly useful for some chemistry later.%n%nThe non-automated way can be done earlier, and it only requires two things: an unbreakable Lumber Axe and trees with a lot of wood, like Sacred Oak, Redwood, or Rainforest Oak. This axe will chop down (most of) the trees and award you with stacks and stacks of wood, much faster than the automated way, but with more work. This process might be useful in the beginning, but you will have to automate the wood input at some point.%n%nComplete one of the tasks and get some wood to continue.

# Quest: Faster Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGA.name=Faster Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGA.desc=Even if you have more wood, this won't help your power issues that much. Using it directly as fuel isn't going to do much for you as you move forward, and turning it into Charcoal will be very important. You have already built a Coke Oven, maybe more than one, but each one takes 90 seconds to produce one Charcoal, an abysmal rate. Unfortunately, there isn't any faster option in this tier, so you will have to build more of these ovens. How many, exactly?%n%nThere are many different goals you might want to go for, but a good metric for your power needs is a setup with 19 Coke Ovens. This number will create both Charcoal and Creosote Oil at a rate that will run two max-sized LP (Low Pressure) Railcraft Boilers, one solid and one liquid, with the quest for those coming right after this one. If you automate this entire setup, it will produce around 2 amps of MV, which are equivalent to 8 amps of LV, plenty of power for this tier and enough to advance you to the next one.%n%nAfter building these Coke Ovens, you will need to automate them. There are a few ways to do this, but one of the cheapest ones is to use Item Pipes, made with Tin for example, with a Conveyor Module in the wood chest/drawer to put the wood in the ovens, and then one Hopper below each oven, into more Item Pipes, to gather the Charcoal. The Creosote is a bit harder to extract, but you can do it with Tinkers' Faucets on the side of each Coke Oven, with a Wooden Fluid Pipe directly under the faucet. You will need to keep reactivating them with redstone, which means you'll also need a redstone clock (there's a block dedicated to this purpose, named Redstone Clock, from Extra Utilities).

# Quest: Two Big Ovens
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGQ.name=Two Big Ovens
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGQ.desc=With 19 Coke Ovens automated, you can sustain two big boilers endlessly. The boilers you want to build for this are specifically the Low Pressure Railcraft Boilers, made with Iron, each one as big as they can be, a 3x4x3 of the Boiler Tanks. These multiblocks are expensive, but you will have plenty of power and will consume all the Creosote from your Coke Ovens to keep them running permanently.%n%n[note]These boilers have a High Pressure variant, for more information look in the multiblocks tab. This setup is not enough to sustain the high pressure boiler but you can add a few more coke ovens to sustain it if you want.[/note]%n%nThe same goes for the Large Bronze Boiler, GregTech's own way of improving on your tiny boilers, but with two added problems: you can't produce Charcoal fast enough for it, and it has a terrible efficiency for your Creosote, which means most of its power will be wasted.%n%nHowever, surprise! The GT++ Semifluid Generators work, and they're very efficient with the Creosote. You can use a few of those coupled with a Large Bronze Boiler, but you will still run into the issue of not producing Charcoal fast enough unless you do something about it. You can choose this as an option and complete this quest, but it's a more "experimental" alternative that is further into LV, although more powerful.

# Quest: The Benzene Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGg.name=The Benzene Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGg.desc=Having walked into MV, you are soon going to be able to produce and consume Benzene. It's more efficient than burning the Charcoal in a boiler, but you will still need to provide a lot of wood to make sure you have consistent, abundant power. It's heavily recommended that you automate this wood input, if you haven't already, possibly with an MV Crop Manager instead of the LV one, or with the Crop Harvester from IC2.%n%nFor automation, you're still stuck with using bonsais, not regular trees. HV will provide a few options that don't need crops, but for now you might want to increase your crop stats by crossbreeding. Planting saplings on cropsticks creates 1/1/1 bonsais, which are much slower than their high-stat variants. If you want to invest in crops, you can later use the high stats to get more of a several dozen different items that crops can output, but you should start with Stickreed to develop your crop stats, not bonsais.%n%nDon't throw away your saplings, either! They will be useful later on, so save up as many as you can.

# Quest: Biodiesel Alternative
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGw.name=Biodiesel Alternative
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGw.desc=Trees are not the only source of power for the renewable enjoyer, though. You can continue to expand your wood production to sustain yourself, but you can also avoid the Charcoal business altogether! There are some naturally-sourced, energetic oils that can be processed into a greener alternative of what oil pumping can lead you to, in this tier. While crude oil turns into Diesel, this oil turns into Biodiesel!%n%nIn general, Biodiesel has less power per bucket than Diesel, which is its main drawback, to compensate for the renewable sources. You could source both of them from plants, but Oilberries are very slow compared to the option you might use, Rape flowers or Goldfish. They are an excellent source of Seed Oil or Fish Oil, but they are also IC2 crops, so their output scales with their stats.%n%nBetween the two, Goldfish have a faster fluid extraction recipe, so they are often recommended for that reason, although it's not a dealbreaker. It's recommended that you get high-statted crops if you want to follow this route, although it is not a necessity, because there are other options that never go into these IC2 crops.%n%nHow many options are there, really? There are many, but they can be divided into 3 categories, and that's what the quest tasks focus on: IC2 crops in a Crop Manager, regular crops in a Multifarm or automatic fishing in a fish trap. All of them are sources of a biological oil, either Seed Oil or Fish Oil, which can then be processed into Biodiesel.

# Quest: The Two Alcohols
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHA.name=The Two Alcohols
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHA.desc=The other fluid that mixes in with one of the natural oils to create Biodiesel can be one of two siblings: Methanol and Ethanol. They're very similar, both alcohols composed of carbon atoms surrounded by hydrogen ones, with one OH at the end. They often come from the same source (for example, running Wood Vinegar or Biomass through a Distillation Tower), but they also have some differences. To produce them from simpler elements in a Chemical Reactor, you'll need MV tier, which is where you are at.%n%nCheck NEI for all the recipes you can use for either of these. You only need one, so choose which of the quest tasks you want to complete. The one you're likely going to produce is Methanol.

# Quest: Extracting the Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHQ.name=Extracting the Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHQ.desc=Each option generates a different amount of oil, but this should be the limiting factor in your Biodiesel production regardless of which you choose. This step is always slow, for better or for worse, so your job is to add more plants or more fish to the system. You might get byproducts, especially with fish, so deal with them accordingly.%n%nYou can upgrade the setup you have when you get to the next tier, or switch what you're using later. Either way, get some oil.

# Quest: Biological Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHg.name=Biological Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHg.desc=Reacting the three chemicals from the steps before with each other, you get a highly energetic fluid that is, for most purposes, equivalent to Diesel. To burn it for power, you cannot use Steam or Gas Turbines, but instead the Combustion Generators that Diesel also uses. They are reasonably efficient, generating 90%% of the EU shown in NEI per bucket of fuel, although Biodiesel has a lower fuel value than either Benzene or Diesel, but not by much. Besides the generators, you also need a big enough fuel input per tick to sustain your base, so make sure to expand your setup enough to fuel all of your other automations.%n%nBiodiesel isn't the only thing you get from this process, though. As a side product, you also get Glycerol. Do not throw this away, it will prove itself useful when making epoxy resin, and possibly in other setups, to save you some work at a later time. When using singleblock Chemical Reactors, the recipe will stop if the Glycerol output is full, a situation in which a super tank will surely come in handy.%n%nWith that said, HV holds a big upgrade to this fuel that you might want to invest in. Keep progressing to check it out!

# Quest: Advanced Coke Oven
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHw.name=Advanced Coke Oven
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHw.desc=Your power needs quadrupled since the last tier, and it's likely that you're not getting Charcoal fast enough. Instead of adding even more Coke Ovens, why not build an upgraded version of them?%n%nThe caveat is that you won't keep producing Creosote alongside the Charcoal from now on. It makes for decent power in the appropriate generators, and you might have already used it to produce Lubricant. Despite that, you can still get Creosote from processing in the next steps of this questline, so you can still get it if you need it. With that out of the way, let's move on to the Advanced Coke Oven (ACO).%n%nHow is it made? The ACO needs a lot more steps than the normal Coke Ovens, steps centered around Nether materials, cooked in the EBF and then cooled down. The cooling part is normally the Vacuum Freezer's job, as you will see later in progression, but you can't build it yet; because of that, you'll have to use IC2 coolant to finish the bricks used in the ACO. Once you've crafted all the blocks needed for this, you can put it together and start it up, to see what's different from before.%n%nThe speed of this new one is 1 Charcoal per second, or the equivalent to 90 Coke Ovens. The cost of this is the loss of the Creosote, and also that it needs fuel to work, making it so approaximately 1/16 of your Charcoal is lost in this step. Fortunately, you can automate it with item pipes, and the EnderIO conduits make it even simpler. Input wood, input charcoal, output charcoal.%n%nMake one of these multis to continue. Be warned that you might need more!

# Quest: Pyrolyse Oven
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIA.name=Pyrolyse Oven
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIA.desc=Some setups really demand space in your base to work properly. You might have thought that when you finished the Coke Oven automation, but there's also an option in this tier that respects that need for speed by just being a gigantic multiblock: the Pyrolyse Oven.%n%nIn essence, it's the original GregTech large-scale wood processor. It is a massive structure, probably bigger than any other multi you've built before, but it uses simple materials like bronze and steel. If you're able to just throw stacks of those at a controller, you can put this behemoth together and enjoy an alternative to the Advanced Coke Oven that has some extra benefits. Unlike any of the other ovens, this one runs on EU, so you need to route your power back here to process the wood you're feeding it.%n%nWhat makes the Pyro valuable? It outputs a fluid alongside the Charcoal, which you can process for extra power and/or byproducts. Look at NEI to see all the alternatives available to you, this multi can usually output several different fluids, but only one at a time, decided by the circuit inside it. The one to choose at this time is Wood Tar, the same fluid you're extracting from the Charcoal. You get a small constant bonus from having built a Pyro, which is really nice.%n%nHowever, the Pyro uses coils in a similar way to the EBF, and those coils affect the time each recipe takes: if you're using Cupronickel Coils, the recipe time is actually 2x what NEI says! This might be too slow for your needs, so make sure you check how much Charcoal you're getting from here. Kanthal Coils are available in MV, using the IC2 Coolant instead of the Vacuum Freezer.%n%nYou can also boost your Pyro by providing Nitrogen. There are separate recipes for that in NEI.

# Quest: Large Steel Boiler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIQ.name=Large Steel Boiler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIQ.desc=Direct Charcoal consumption is also improved, if you want to go that way. The second Large Boiler is made out of Steel, but needs HV circuits, which you can make in this tier by using Polyethylene in the circuit boards. It generates steam at a speed equivalent to 1000 EU/t at 100%% fuel efficiency for that steam, which you can't reach with the inefficient Steam Turbines available to you. It also needs two ACOs, but it skips any further processing, at an additional cost of heavy pollution that you'll have to deal with in some way.%n%nThis is the most "spammable" setup you can make. There are no further upgrades to the Large Boilers that accept these cheap fuels (the next boilers only accept some more complicated ones), but you can wallshare these to increase the energy input into your processing. The biggest problem, as usual, is transporting the steam to prevent big energy losses across long stretches of cable. This is not the best option, but it can be used.

# Quest: Wood Tar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIg.name=Wood Tar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIg.desc=Benzene cannot be extracted directly from Charcoal. To get to it, you need to process the extracted fluid, called Wood Tar. In the past, this was a very slow step, which forced players to spam Fluid Extractors to keep up with the other parts of their Benzene line, but it's a lot faster now. Regardless, you still need more than one Fluid Extractor for each machine used in the step after this one, if you are using LV machines here.%n%nSince it's an LV recipe, you can overclock it with an MV machine, but you'll waste some EU that way (each recipe will cost twice as much EU). To continue, craft either 2 LV Fluid Extractors or 1 MV one.

# Quest: The Most Powerful Biodiesel 
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIw.name=The Most Powerful Biodiesel 
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIw.desc=If you've been working with renewable diesels before, you might want to upgrade them further. Instead of just duplicating your existing setup, you can upgrade Biodiesel to Cetane-Boosted Diesel (CBD), with a specific additive called Tetranitromethane (TNM). You'll get more bang for your buck if you upgrade to this fuel, instead of just making more Biodiesel, since it has 3x more EU per bucket, and the TNM is needed in small quantities. Before you start working on the new setup, though, it's important that you increase the amount of Seed/Fish Oil you're making, and in turn the items that turn into those oils.%n%nAs before, you can use IC2 crops, regular crops/trees or fishing. For IC2 crops, you can use the Multifarm set to IC2 crop mode, which needs HV-gated Uranium Electron Tubes but automated more than 1000 crops while being very conservative with power and fertilizer, or the HV Crop Manager. For normal crops/trees, use the EnderIO Farming Station, also unlocked in HV. For fishing, you don't have new tools, you can only add more Fish Catchers or use Goldfish IC2 crops if you're oriented that way.%n%nTo complete this quest, make a Multifarm, a Farming Station or some Fish Catchers.

# Quest: Trees Growing Faster
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJA.name=Trees Growing Faster
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJA.desc=No matter which way you used to get wood, you can simplify it. There's nothing much simpler than just pulling out more and more wood from a multiblock that doesn't even grow trees! That's what the Tree Growth Simulator does, with a special input: saws. This multi can replace the bonsais that were used for wood automation, however it is only available in IV. You have two further options in the meantime:%n%nTo continue using bonsais, in case you have gotten good stats on them, you can use the HV version of the Crop Manager, or the multiblock version, the Multifarm. This multi is special because it needs Uranium Rods, which are HV due to needing Eyes of Ender, but it has a massive range to harvest crops, being able to work with 1000+ of them, while only consuming 6 ULV amps when built correctly. It also hydrates and fertilizes automatically, and is much more efficient with the Fertilizer than its competition. Compared to the Crop Manager, it only loses out on the extra drops per harvest.%n%nOther than these two options, you can also grow and harvest trees normally with the EnderIO Farmer, which is a more typical tree automation machine. It's HV-locked, simple, and reliable and only needs a bit of power to get the wood you need, at a pretty fast rate. Ideally you want to use an unbreakable lumber axe with a tree type that produces a lot of logs (spruce is decent). To crank out a lot of wood you can then use sprinklers with water or a world accelerator.

# Quest: Sapling Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJQ.name=Sapling Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJQ.desc=Wood has been a big part of your power generation, and you might have even used other plants or fish for oil. Even if that's true, there is a constant output from your trees that has been left unused all this time: the saplings! No matter which tree you chose to automate, you are surely stockpiling the saplings matching that tree, since there's little that is really useful to do with them. At this point, though, you can set up a decent Biomass setup.%n%nTo clarify, Biomass is just a fluid made from plant stuff. It doesn't need to be saplings, but that's most likely something you have a lot of lying around. On top of that, there are multiple types of Biomass, one of them called Fermented Biomass, which is very similar but different, and the recommended path for you to take, since it needs fewer steps than the alternatives and gets you to the DT recipe just fine.%n%nAfter this processing line is finished, you will have a lot of new chemicals automated that you won't have from Wood Tar alone. If you are already processing Wood Vinegar, you will have several repeat outputs, though. That said, if you complete this line, you will get Ethanol + Methanol and Ammonia, which make the Cetane-Boosted Diesel process much easier. All of these lines interact with each other, and you can get bigger and bigger returns if you automate several at once!%n%nFor now, focus on putting together the machines needed to get from Saplings to Fermented Biomass. You will need a Compressor, a Pulverizer and a Pyrolyse Oven for this route.

# Quest: Fractioned Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJg.name=Fractioned Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJg.desc=One of the most important steps is to remove the limitation you had when distilling. Wood Tar turns into Benzene? That's not how it should be, there's much more to get from that tar than what you've been extracting from it. To keep the rest, you need more space in the distillation process, or, more specifically, more height. Each of the fluids that can be separated from within the tar will stick at a different height level, sitting on top of all the others that are denser than itself.%n%nBasically, you need a multiblock, instead of a singleblock. The Distillation Tower you will need for this recipe has to be at least 6 blocks tall, with 1 input plus 5 outputs. Out of it, you will get Benzene, Toluene and Phenol, which are all viable gases for power alongside being very useful for progression (Toluene for compressing with TNT and moving past HV, Phenol for crafting circuits in the next tier and other chemical lines). You will also get various types of Dimethylbenzene. For now the only one of interest is 1,2-Dimethylbenzene which is a part of the PBI line in IV. Though even that is unfortunately of little use to you right now. You also get Creosote for your Lubricant needs, or a little extra power.

# Quest: Creosote's Work
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJw.name=Creosote's Work
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJw.desc=Your old pal, Creosote Oil, is back in the game! That's right, you can get it automatically from Charcoal processing again, as you did with the first Coke Ovens, and what you can do with it is about the same. The two main purposes it has are power generation and Lubricant, which you will want to use in Cutting Machines, and will also be required in some later multiblocks like the Large Combustion Engine and the Multiblock Miner. Using a Brewery, you can add some Redstone to quickly convert this oil to Lubricant and keep it in stock for whatever machine or craft needs it.%n%nAlternatively, you can get a bit of extra power from this. The fuel value per bucket is much lower than the big three, but it still has an interesting use. When the semifluid generators were broken, and the Creosote wasn't usable in them, there were setups using two max-size LP Railcraft boilers to turn the amount you get from one DT into the EU needed to run it, making that step completely free in terms of power. There were some fine details, such as the Steam Turbines needing to all be LV for the fuel efficiency, but it'd be easier to use semifluid generators from the start. Either way, you can at least remove the EU cost from the DT from the equation, if you wish to.

# Quest: Phenol's Width
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKA.name=Phenol's Width
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKA.desc=This one is not as specialized as Toluene is. It's also more likely that you will be producing it in a Chemical Reactor, or working around it with recipes, if you choose not to use Oil or Benzene for some reason. You're here, though, so you have all of the possibilities, and all of the advantages of skipping through steps in several important chemical lines that accept Phenol, one of the first being epoxy resin. If you check NEI, you can more easily see where this chemical can come in handy.%n%nIt is true, though, that it isn't as required in HV as Toluene is. Since both of them are good power options alongside Benzene, it's preferable that you burn this one for power between the two, if you have to. In the best situation, you won't need to, but it's also acceptable to burn all of the Benzene and some Phenol, while the Toluene gets converted into its gelled form to make several stacks of TNT. Don't discredit the amount of power you can get from this.

# Quest: Toluene's Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKQ.name=Toluene's Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKQ.desc=Trinitrotoluene. Shorthand, that's TNT, or one of the most popular types of explosive there is. Not only is it popular, but it's a centerpiece of a special type of GTNH crafting: implosion compressing! There are other types of explosives available, but TNT is the best for this purpose.%n%nThat's all fine and dandy, but unfortunately it is not optional. To get past HV, you will need Titanium, and the most reasonable way to accomplish that is to get it from ores found in the Moon, which will need a rocket made of very compressed plates, courtesy of a few stacks of said TNT. To source it, you will need a lot of Toluene, and from there you can make a choice: make regular TNT, or add Nitric Acid to the mix and come out with Industrial TNT, a more powerful version that can, for the most part, craft more items than the cheaper TNT. Some of the renewable powergen processes can output Ammonia, which makes Nitric Acid much easier to produce, so keep that in mind.%n%nToluene, plus TNT or iTNT is what you need. The rocket will thank you later.

# Quest: Further Charcoal Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKg.name=Further Charcoal Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKg.desc=The Distillation Tower you've recently unlocked can bring forth many, many more outputs than what you've done so far. If you look at NEI, you might see that there are other Charcoal-related fluids that have recipes in this multi, and this is the time to work with them: doing it all in singleblock Distlleries would be very wasteful.%n%nThe most important part about getting these fluids is the Pyrolyse Oven. If you haven't made one, it's highly recommended that you make at least one. You can upgrade both the energy hatch and the coils used in it to keep it up to speed with everything else, no need to build more than one. Aside from fulfilling the purpose of the Coke Oven, to cook Wood into Charcoal, it gives the choice of which of several fluids it also outputs as it does the processing. Most of the options are potentially useful, but a complete Benzene setup will prefer Charcoal Byproducts because they are, essentially, the complete product.%n%nATTENTION: This setup is technically HV, but it's quite expensive. It's fine if you move to EV first before you build this. It is in no way required to progress in HV.%n%nWith Charcoal Byproducts, the full setup involves DTing that into Wood Tar, Wood Vinegar and Wood Gas, and then DTing all of those into their respective outputs. With one tower for each, you will end up with a quad DT setup, very expensive overall in terms of Stainless Steel, but with huge savings compared to making 4 separate ones. Keep in mind, however, that they will not all have the same height. Additionally, Wood Gas is not as valuable as the other two (although it is a decent Ethylene source), so it's also a good idea to make 2 of the 4 DTs process that, and burn the Wood Gas for the little power it can provide.%n%nAs a final note, the towers do process things slowly. Add Distilleries, if you wish, to get specific outputs.

# Quest: Vinegar into Acetone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKw.name=Vinegar into Acetone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKw.desc=From Wood Vinegar, one of the useful outputs you can walk away with is Acetone. It's not very easy to craft, needing Calcium Dust and Acetic Acid, which needs Methanol or Hydrogen... instead of all that, you can get it right here, alongside some of the other chemicals in this family tree.%n%nWhat is it for, though? Simple: Epoxy Resin, Cetane-Boosted Diesel, Raw Gasoline and maybe some up-and-coming glue. Want it? Get it, it'll surely prove useful.

# Quest: Direct Ethylene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLA.name=Direct Ethylene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLA.desc=Wood Gas has a big portion of barely useful outputs, but also some hidden gems. The hardest one to get, arguably, is Ethylene, since it needs automated Sulfuric Acid alongside the Ethanol you're already getting. DTing Wood Gas is the main way to get Ethylene directly, without worrying about the acid, when it comes to renewable power. This make Polyethylene, an important plastic you've already worked with at this point.%n%nThe caveat is, of course, the small amount that you get in this recipe. Whether or not you set this process up is your choice, but it's generally useful, especially if your main Ethanol source is Wood Vinegar.

# Quest: No Benzene Yet
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLQ.name=No Benzene Yet
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLQ.desc=This questbook page is supposed to explain the Benzene powergen line, but you might have noticed that you haven't made any Benzene yet. That's because the recipe path to get it from Charcoal has an MV recipe, and you can't just skip straight to MV with the small amount of steam you were using in the Bronze Age.%n%nThere are also other paths for renewable power in this page. They have similar sources, or the same source, but different processing lines, and the entire thing looks like a tree branch, with many different ways in which you can go. The Carbon Monoxide path is one example of this, and there are many more to come in the future.%n%nRegardless of which path you chose to get power from your Charcoal, you can now sustain an EBF comfortably and get power more efficiently. It's recommended that you move away from steam in the next tier, because you will need to transport too much of it to produce good amounts of MV power. Fortunately, you won't need steam at all!

# Quest: Green Nitric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLg.name=Green Nitric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLg.desc=One half of TNM is Nitric Acid, which has more paths to reach it than can be listed here. It's basically Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Oxygen merged together, and many compounds made from these things can lead you to Nitric Acid. How you get this is up to you, but it might be a lot easier if you already automated some Distillation Tower setups for other renewable resources.%n%nLet me explain. Nitric Acid can be made directly from Ammonia and Oxygen. O2 has many sources, and you should have already automated it, but Ammonia is harder to get: you either make it from Nitrogen Oxide and Dioxide, or you skip all that with a Fermented Biomass DT, which outputs Ammonia directly. That is the fastest way, if you already made that setup, otherwise you'll need to chain several reactions together.

# Quest: Green Ethenone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLw.name=Green Ethenone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLw.desc=The other half of TNM is Ethenone. Once again, DTs can make this easier for you, but Ethenone is pretty simple to figure out: either Acetic Acid or Acetone can make it, both of which are DT outputs, but Acetic Acid also needs Sulfuric Acid to make it.%n%nAcetone is easier, but either way works. One important thing to understand is that you only need a small, tiny amount of Ethenone when compared to other chemicals. When working with Biodiesel, 200L of Ethenone are enough for 9000L of CBD, which is equal to 9 million EU at 100%% fuel efficiency. With that consideration, each bucket of Ethenone corresponds to 45M EU! Quite powerful, if I do say so myself.%n%nClearly, your bottleneck will be the Biodiesel and, in turn, the Seed/Fish Oil.

# Quest: Green Cetane-Boosted Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMA.name=Green Cetane-Boosted Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMA.desc=Tetranitromethane is the additive you need to turn Biodiesel into Cetane-Boosted Diesel. Each bucket of the first turns into 0.9 buckets of the second, but if you look at the EU values per bucket of both, 320k turns into 900k EU, discounting 5.7k EU from the craft, a huge upgrade in power generation. The TNM only costs some thousand EU, the main difficulty is automating the input of all the materials, which shouldn't be too hard at this stage of progression.%n%nThe power density of this fuel is great, but it doesn't mean you'll have enough power to get to EV. What really matters here is the amount of plants or fish you can provide, since all the other items and fluids are basically additives when compared to the amount of oil you need. It's hard to match the speed at which crude oil can be obtained, but you can bring forth a lot of Seed/Fish Oil if you increase the size of those setups.%n%nThere are more possibilities for CBD in the future, if you want to move towards those.

# Quest: Fermented Biomass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMQ.name=Fermented Biomass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMQ.desc=After this biomass leaves the Pyro, you can input it straight into a DT and it will be separated into its component parts. This is one of the tallest towers that you can make with fully renewable powergen and, sadly, not all outputs are useful. However, you'll still get a nice bang for your buck, if you manage to not get lost in NEI in the middle of all this chemistry.%n%nThe following quests will explain some important uses for the outputs of this DT recipe. First, however, you need to get it going, which means you need a lot of Fermented Biomass and a tall enough tower to process it. There is one caveat that you might run into as you try to speed up your machines, which is that saplings don't come fast enough! You can work around this by throwing more plant stuff into the Compressor, and how you solve this is really up to you and what you have.

# Quest: Free For All Fertilizer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMg.name=Free For All Fertilizer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMg.desc=You might have heard of the Fertilia crop, which can easily automate the Fertilizer input for your crops, if you're using them. Why bother, though, when you're already getting it from your DT? That's right, you will also be able to automate fertilizing alongside everything else, which is very important for high-statted crops, making all the inputs (energy, water, fertilizer) automated without any outside inputs. Pretty neat, huh?%n%nThat said, you might not be using IC2 crops at all. In that case, you can electrolyze it, and you'll get a lot of free Carbon and Calcite Dust, which you'll certainly use in future chemistry. You can also use the CO2 Gas from the DT to get Carbon, I guess? It's not very useful.

# Quest: Methane Stinks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMw.name=Methane Stinks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMw.desc=The output you'll get the most of, in the Fermented Biomass DT, is Methane. 6/10 of the input amount will become Methane, and this makes for the best choice for powering your powergen, even if other outputs can also serve as fuel options. It's important to remember that Methane is used in several important chemical lines, such as PTFE and Silicone Rubber, but you'll get much more of it than you need for those purposes.%n%nThe Methane you get from one DT can power it 4 times. Using 1/4 of your power there, you can fuel the singleblock machines you're using, and the wood automation source as well if you feel like it. Regardless, this setup should fuel itself just fine.

# Quest: Alcohols Here
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNA.name=Alcohols Here
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNA.desc=Ethanol and Methanol are two different chemicals, but they are both outputs from DTing Fermented Biomass or Wood Vinegar. Between the two, you can make Ethylene (and then Polyethylene, by adding Sulfuric Acid and Oxygen), Biodiesel, Dense Hydrazine (GT++ rocket fuel, it's very powerful in IV, try it), some chemicals for HOG (EV fuel from crude oil), and many other things such as Chloromethane. For future processing lines, you're going to want to have these stocked up.%n%nThey are both also power sources, if you end up with full super tanks. Their fuel values aren't the best, with Ethanol at 192k and Methanol at 84k, but they are perfectly capable of fueling your powergen setups, leaving your best fuels free to power your main base. Even if you're using them for Biodiesel and Polyethylene at the same time, it's quite likely that you'll have leftovers. If you have the choice to use any of the two in a recipe, choose Methanol, since Ethanol has a lot more EU per bucket to give.%n%n(Also note that you get almost no Ethanol from Wood Vinegar compared to Methanol. On the Fermented Biomass side, the amounts are the same.)

# Quest: Skipped into Ammonia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNQ.name=Skipped into Ammonia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNQ.desc=This one is almost a flex, at times, depending on your future plans. Ammonia is one of the most power-intensive early chemicals to produce, from Nitrogen and Hydrogen, with a slow HV recipe compared to most others being produced quickly. It is used very often, in various stages of progression, often to make Nitric Acid that is used for Industrial TNT, Cetane-Boosted Diesel and other products. From Fermented Biomass, you can get it directly, although only one tenth of the amount of biomass used, 1000 mL to 100 mL of Ammonia.%n%nThe rate at which you're going to get this, just from one HV DT, isn't very fast. DTs are slow by design, and the ratio for Ammonia isn't great, so you can accumulate it if you leave the setup running for a while, but you won't be able to feed it into multiple automations that require it unless you upgrade the DT or make more of them, both of which are easy to do later on. Alternatively, you can choose to void the other outputs and work with singleblock Distilleries instead, but this depends on the rate at which you're inputting saplings.%n%nTo note, Ammonia is required to make Cetane-Boosted Diesel, which you can make from Biodiesel. You can get a good mileage for that just from one Fermented Biomass DT.

# Quest: Sodium Hydroxide
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNg.name=Sodium Hydroxide
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNg.desc=The Biodiesel needs a bit of powder magic. In reality, this powder is another chemical that this chain uses, Sodium Hydroxide, NaOH. The bad part is that you can't continue without making this, but there's a boon to this: you only need a little bit of it, around 1 dust to make 45 buckets of Biodiesel.%n%nUnlike in the other steps, you can probably get away with batch crafting this instead of automating it, and still have consistent power from this fuel line. One stack of this dust is enough to make more than 100 million EU's worth of power, as long as the other fluids are automated. Given that, you can forget about it for a long time, but not forever. If you choose to not automate it yet, make sure you check it from time to time.%n%n(This can be automated from Salt Water, which can be automated from Tearstalks, a specific IC2 crop. You get Chlorine and Hydrogen as well.)

# Quest: Upgrading Your Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNw.name=Upgrading Your Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNw.desc=Having moved another tier, you have unlocked another fuel upgrade! Luckily for you, it uses simple inputs, although the place in which you craft it is more expensive than usual. This time around, the bigger expense is by far the processing multiblock, and you will need several stacks of Titanium to put it together.%n%nGiven as much, this is not a task for the very start of EV. It's recommended that you automate your Titanium processing line before you attempt this, because the Chemical Plant is going to grind your manual patience otherwise. If you already have a lot of that, everything else should be much simpler.%n%n(You will need a lot more than a stack. This is just to get you started.)

# Quest: CBD Into Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOA.name=CBD Into Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOA.desc=There are no more Diesel-related upgrades for the CBD. To continue using Combustion Generators, or the LCE, you can only make your setup bigger or upgrade energy hatches. There is, however, a more power-dense fuel that uses CBD in its recipe, but there's a catch: it's a solid fuel, to be used in steam boilers, which gives it advantages and disadvantages.%n%nEverything from this quest onwards is about those solid fuels. There are two versions, one with additional inputs over the other, and they both follow the same logic: they need to be converted to Steam, which is hard to transport, convert into EU and basically require the EV and IV Large Steam Boilers. However, the combination of these fuels and those boilers is much, much more fuel efficient than before, if you are willing to face the additional challenges in this kind of setup.%n%nHow does it generally go? If you already have CBD, you can get power from it by putting it directly in Combustion Generators. In this line, though, you need to automate Fuel Binder, add blocks of Charcoal, Coal or Coal Coke and then put the Super Fuel in a Titanium or Tungstensteel Large Boiler, where you get Superheated Steam. After that, you need an HP Steam Turbine multi, followed by a regular Steam Turbine multi, and the setup is complete.%n%nIf you want to continue, then you'll need at least one Titanium Large Boiler. Build one.

# Quest: Industrial Coke Oven
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOQ.name=Industrial Coke Oven
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOQ.desc=Your EV endeavors might push you into a GT++ multiblock, despite most of those being IV-tier. This happens because the special alloys used to put them together need to be crafted in an Alloy Blast Smelter, which is IV, but the Industrial Coke Oven (ICO) does not!%n%nWhat does it do? It's in the name, it's a really fast Coke Oven. So fast, in fact, that it can replace a few dozen Pyrolyse Ovens. It actually takes its recipes from that multi, so you also get the additional fluid, such as Charcoal Byproducts, alongside the greatly increased processing speed. The caveat is that this multi needs both Titanium and Tungsten, although only a small amount of the latter. You can get that much from processing End Stone Dust, Ender Goo or Moon Dust.%n%nYou can also choose between two types of casings. One of them does 12x parallels and the other does 24x parallels, which means the multi can do that amount of recipes at the same time per craft, if it receives enough power to do so. Since they're both quite cheap, you should use the better casings.

# Quest: Mass Distilled Water
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOg.name=Mass Distilled Water
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOg.desc=Water is completely free, that much is obvious. Distilled Water, though? It's the same input, but it needs a machine to process it into this version, and you best not choose singleblock Distilleries to do this, because they are incredibly slow and will never keep up with your demands.%n%nThe obvious option is a Distillation Tower. The less obvious option is a Steam Turbine multi, which outputs Distilled Water that is supposedly piped back to where the steam is made. However, there are several steam producers that use regular water, so you can try that? The DT is the simplest and most direct option, though. 3-high is the minimum, so you have to build it like that. It doesn't need a lot of power, it will fill up a tank of any size over time since the water input is completely free.%n%nTo prevent it from running continuously, though, here's a neat trick, in case you haven't done it already: take the output hatch on the second layer, where the Distilled Water comes from, and put it directly above the DT controller. Then, put a Fluid Detector Cover on the bottom side of the hatch and a Machine Controller Cover on the top side of the controller, so that the covers are facing each other. Set the controller cover to "Disable with Redstone", and the DT will stop after the fluid tank you've chosen is full. When it gets full, the output hatch will get stuck with some water, and it will send a redstone signal that stops the DT.

# Quest: Nitric And Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOw.name=Nitric And Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOw.desc=Sourcing these two should be easy at this point. Overall, the easiest option for Sulfuric Acid is oil processing, but you can also make it from Sulfur Dust, which is so very common from ore processing.%n%nNitric Acid is a bit more convoluted, but you might have already automated it, since it's needed for Cetane-Boosted Diesel. Ammonia and Oxygen can make it, or Nitrogen Dioxide instead of Ammonia. You won't be able to do it in a single step, but a small line of Chemical Reactor, or their multiblock equivalent, will do it for you.

# Quest: Titanium Chemical Plant
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPA.name=Titanium Chemical Plant
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPA.desc=This is the difficult part in the whole process. The multi in which Nitrobenzene is crafted is the Exxonmobil Chemical Plant, also known as the Chemplant, and it is a gigantic 7x7x7 structure with 4 separate upgradable parts to it. Even worse, the outer structure uses multiblock Machine Casings, making the DT look cheap by comparison, and the inside needs a lot of the casings used to craft single blocks.%n%nThe difference between them is that the tier of the outer structure that you need is mentioned in the recipe you want to craft, and the tier of the inner structure is generally related to the EU/t of the recipe, minus one tier. This is because, like the EBF and the LCR, you can use 2 energy hatches, so this HV recipe can be made with MV energy hatches. Since the inner structure's tier decides the max tier of the hatches used in the Chemplant, you can make it out of MV machine casings, which use Aluminium.%n%nThe outer structure will still need many stacks of Titanium, so this is where most of your effort will go. Good luck.%n%n[note]Technically, you could also make Nitrobenzene in an LCR instead of a Chemplant. But it is less energy efficient and dilutes your acid. That option was only added for those too weak to handle a Chemplant.[/note]

# Quest: Nitrobenzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPQ.name=Nitrobenzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPQ.desc=With the Chemplant finished, you can slap in the necessary hatches and automate this fuel easily. The Titanium gate really is the main obstacle to this improvement, since you can more than triple the power your Benzene can make with some cheap additions to it!%n%nAs usual, the cost of building the setup will pay off over time. In this case, it'll happen even faster than usual, given how cheap the setup is. Benzene doesn't go anywhere beyond this point, but you can grab this final upgrade and make a lot out of it. Check out the multiblock Gas Turbines, and add a good turbine into them, made of a material like Manyullyn or Shadow Metal.

# Quest: Coal Or Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPg.name=Coal Or Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPg.desc=The Super Fuels are blocks of burnable material, like Coal Blocks, which they need in their crafting recipe. It doesn't have to be Coal, though: you can do Coal, Charcoal or Coal Coke, and all of them make the same amount of Super Fuel. However, the amount of fluid fuel used changes based on which kind of block you used, which poses a problem.%n%n(We will ignore Lignite Coal, since it is by far the worst option. If you want to use it, dealing with the efficiency problem is up to you.)%n%nThe problem is this: the amount of EU you save by choosing Charcoal instead of the other two is less than the amount of EU that the additional fuel can make. Basically, the most efficient option is Coal Coke, then Coal, then Charcoal. The easiest option to automate is certainly Charcoal, which means this is a choice between ease of automation and fuel efficiency. Even if you use Charcoal, you will still get more EU from the final fuel than what you used as input.%n%nCoal can be automated too, though! There are many ways to do this, but the most popular way of automating items that aren't renewable by default is usually by using either IC2 crops or Forestry bees, both of which have their own renewable Coal. If you never made progress in either of those, keep in mind that they need time and effort to give you good results, but if you have, then they are great options to make this fuel even more efficiently. Naturally, you will then turn it into Coal Coke with Pyrolyse Ovens, ACOs or ICOs.%n%nStock up on either Charcoal or Coal Coke blocks to continue.

# Quest: Normal Or Magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPw.name=Normal Or Magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPw.desc=There are two different Super Fuels, not just one. The regular Solid Super Fuel (SSF) has a heat value of 100k, whereas the Magic Solid Super Fuel (MSSF) has it as 150k, or 50%% more EU per block. As you can guess, the second one is more valuable, and worth it to make, but it requires even more processing than the first one.%n%nThe good part is, you don't really need lots of Thaumcraft progression. You barely need any, if at all, because there are many ways to make the Magic Fuel Binder and the block itself, including some that don't use any Thaumcraft items. There are so many options that this quest won't ask for a specific one, and it is once again up to you to decide which to choose, if you choose the magic fuel at all. As a tip, Alumentum is not mineable like Diamonds, but it can be automated by throwing Charcoal Dust at a Cauldron, and it has a higher burn value than the inputs. Additionally, for Coal Coke, only the Alumentum option is available.%n%nBasically, the SSF has 3 steps: craft the binder, craft the solid block and craft the fluid. The MSSF has more steps: craft the binder, upgrade it to magic binder, craft the solid block, craft the fluid and then finish with the extra items. Choose your own path.

# Quest: Super Fuel And Boiling
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQA.name=Super Fuel And Boiling
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQA.desc=If you've gotten this far, you should be ready to produce Steam at an alarming rate from this hyper-efficient fuel. Unlike Combustion Generators and Gas Turbines, you will need more multis in front of your Large Boiler because it outputs Superheated Steam. More specifically, you will need two turbines: one for turning the Superheated Steam into EU and regular Steam, and another for turning the regular Steam into EU and water, to be reused in the boiler.%n%nThe multis will not run without a turbine inside the controller. The size and material of a turbine determines the optimal flow rate and the EU/t at that rate. Good materials in EV are Shadow Metal (from Thaumcraft) and Manyullyn, before upgrading to Oriharukon in IV. Steam turbines usually generate less EU/t than gas turbines but that depends on the amount and tier of the boilers, and whether you are using loose mode or not(check the Steam Turbine quest for more details).%n%nSteam flow rates are very high which means you will need huge GT pipes to keep up, but there is a better way: AE2 P2P tunnels, set to fluid mode, can teleport fluids from one multi to the next without caring for high flow rates. With all that taken care of, the only thing left to do is place an EV Buffered Dynamo Hatch on each turbine. Now your setup is complete!

# Quest: More Steam For Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQg.name=More Steam For Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQg.desc=The last of the Large Boilers is IV-tier, and it's the Tungstensteel version. In numbers, it beats all of the other boilers, both in EU/t and fuel efficiency, so it's a good idea to build one or more of these if you've been working on the Super Fuels. Each one will output Superheated Steam matching an EU output of 16000 EU/t, at 100%% fuel efficiency, or 24000 EU/t with 150%%.%n%nAlongside this, you should also work on automating the Magic Super Fuel, if you haven't already. It needs more inputs, but it's even more bang for your buck, the entire point of this fuel line! You will need automated Blazes and Endermen, preferably, unless you can automate the Thaumcraft version of the Magic Fuel Binder recipe. For the fuel itself, Alumentum can be done simply with Charcoal Dust in a Cauldron or Thaumatorium.%n%nThe dark blue towers might ask for a lot of Large Turbines to process all of the Steam, especially if you build a quad boiler setup. You can expect almost 11000 L/t of it as output, per boiler, so look at some of the turbines you can craft and check out how many you need. The quest after this one gives some suggestions for battling the potential turbine spam.

# Quest: Huge Turbines And Loose Mode
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQw.name=Huge Turbines And Loose Mode
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQw.desc=If you are invested in making good IV power from Super Fuel, you will need a lot of Turbine multis. Their EU/t at optimal flow is much too low for you to survive with only one or two. However, there are several things you should consider in regards to these turbines, and the fuel you're using.%n%nIn summary, this fuel is very, very efficient. Turbines can be made faster by losing some efficiency. You have more than enough fuel efficiency to spare!%n%nLet's review this in more detail. Turbines produce EU based on the flow rate of the fuel that they are consuming. Their optimal flow represents the highest fuel efficiency they can reach (140%% or 150%% for the good turbines in these tiers), but you can increase the flow beyond that point and still get a higher EU/t value. However, the fuel becomes less efficient. A good tradeoff, if you need it.%n%nSteam loses efficiency quickly if you do this, though. The right way to pull this off with Steam Turbines is to switch to Loose mode, a mode unique to them, which makes the optimal flow shoot way up at a considerable loss to fuel efficiency. The jump in EU/t is so high, however, that you can replace a whole squadron of turbines with just one or two, as you can see if you look at the turbine items' tooltips.%n%nEach setup has their own details, so you will have to work things out and make personal decisions about how you will manage the turbines. Just make sure to not let the EU/t value go beyond the maximum that the dynamo hatch can output, or you will have problems!

# Quest: Distilling Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMRQ.name=Distilling Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMRQ.desc=From Wood Tar, you can selectively filter out the energetic Benzene to use as a power source. This tar is like a fluid equivalent of the Charcoal, and it actually has a lot of useful chemicals hidden inside: to separate them, the tar needs to be heated up to a temperature that will cause some of its components to evaporate, but not others. This is fractional distillation, and the singleblock Distillery, in this case an MV one, can recover only one of the outputs of such distillation.%n%nThere is something that is worth considering, though: Benzene is not the only useful chemical that can be gotten from Wood Tar. In HV, you can get all the outputs at the same time, but right now you can only choose one. Other options that you might want are Toluene and Creosote. The former can be used to make TNT, to do Implosion Compressor crafts, and the latter is useful to make Lubricant, if you ran out of it and are not using Coke Ovens anymore.


## Quest Line: Powerful Nuclear Physics
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGg.name=Powerful Nuclear Physics
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGg.desc=A series of questlines dedicated to nuclear fission and fusion, both for power and useful items.

# Quest: Basis for All Reactors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSQ.name=Basis for All Reactors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSQ.desc=Nuclear energy is first available in EV. However, it comes in all shapes and forms, and it can be hard to choose one kind of setup to use amongst all of those that are available. To start this questbook page, this first quest will be a summary of how nuclear power can be produced, and when it is available. Other quests down the line will have more details about each specific setup, but this is an overview of all of them.%n%nTL;DR: Nuke < Fluid Nuke < Vacuum Nuke < LFTR = THTR = Naq Reactor < Fusion < Compact Fusion for power, per reactor. For breeding, Nuke < LFTR = Naq Reactor < HTGR in terms of breeding speed and outputs, with fusion being required to make some materials.%n%nThe first nuclear source you have access to is the Industrialcraft 2 Nuclear Reactor, usually called a nuke. It's a small singleblock that can have additional chambers attached to it to make a multiblock structure, and the amount of chambers decides the amount of space available for the nuke's components. Inside it, fuel rods with radioactive materials generate power, and every other item serves to control the temperature of the reactor and keep it from exploding. It generates EU directly, but it can be upgraded to a fluid nuke, which outputs hot coolant instead, for the Large Heat Exchanger, but with more efficiency. Lastly, there's also the vacuum nuke, which is very similar to regular nukes but it cools down by using Coolant Cells, which wear out and are only reusable by using Vacuum Freezers. Usual fuels for all of these are Thorium, in EV, and Uranium, in IV.%n%nBetween IV and LuV, there's another kind of reactor, the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR). In this large multi, the Thorium and Uranium are mixed with very hot, molten salts (which need to be prepared in another multi), improving the power generation at the cost of additional processing. It's an expensive setup, but the depleted fuel can be recycled into many more byproducts than usual, especially at LuV, where you can get almost all the noble gases amongst other things, alongside huge amounts of power.%n%nAt those same tiers (albeit mostly for LuV and above), there are also two larger multis, the Thorium High Temperature Reactor (THTR) and the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR). The THTR is mostly for power, needing an input of about 0.5 IV amps and outputting LuV power at a varied amount of amps, whereas the HTGR is a breeder reactor, outputting 1/20 the amount of hot coolant, which is where the power generation comes from, but with much better ratios for breeding into Lutetium and other elements.%n%nAnother kind of nuclear reactor is the Good Generators Naquadah Reactor, which coincidentally has recipes to consume Thorium Liquid Fuel and Uranium Liquid Fuel, alongside the several types of Naquadah fuel that exist. With these two, this reactor can process those elements much faster than regular nukes, which is helpful for power and for breeding, but it requires more processing until those fuels are ready to be consumed. Additionally, there are fuel rods for the IC2 nukes that use different Thorium and Uranium fuels, more or less related to these.%n%nFrom then on, it's fusion power. The infamous GregTech Fusion Reactors work by fusing two elements into a new one, which is often a required step for progression, but they also turn the power they require into exponentially more in the way of plasma. Helium and Tin Plasma are some of the most used for power, and putting them into Plasma Turbines is an excellent source of power for lategame, in ZPM to UEV and so on. There are 4 tiers to the regular Fusion Reactors, but there is also compact fusion and some other kinks to fusion that you might explore later on.%n%nThis page will mostly serve to guide you into making a choice between all of these possibilities. It's pretty much guaranteed that you'll use at least 2-3 of these setups, so try to get comfortable with these quest descriptions.

# Quest: Focus on Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSg.name=Focus on Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSg.desc=This side of the advanced fission branch will focus on the items you can get from nuclear fission. In terms of physics, this fission refers to atoms being broken into two parts, each of which generates a different atom. This has potential to produce some interesting stuff and, perhaps, replace some chemical lines.%n%nAs you advance, your rewards will scale just as the complexity does. However, this part is one where development has lagged behind, and some fission setups are poorly rewarding when it comes to byproducts. However, as those setups are updated, so will these quests, so check back on new updates to see what has changed!

# Quest: Fission Guidelines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSw.name=Fission Guidelines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSw.desc=The branch to the left and to the right are both about nuclear fission, or the midgame content about fusion. If you're looking for fusion, you went the wrong way! Go straight down for that content, although it only begins in LuV.%n%nOn the left side, the top side is the beginning of it all, with your usual IC2 nukes that were developed more than 10 years ago. On the bottom, the neat and powerful upgrades to those nukes, either fluid or vacuum.%n%nOn the right side, the top side is dedicated to power, whereas the bottom side is dedicated to breeding (byproducts). This covers the more GTNH-exclusive fission content, all of which comes after IC2 nukes, and generally builds on their concept to work faster and pump out more complex, and often more useful things.

# Quest: IC2 Nuke Variations
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTA.name=IC2 Nuke Variations
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTA.desc=This branch of the questline focuses on the IC2 nukes that work differently from the simple kind that is explored on the branch right next to this one. They are more powerful, but also require more setup.%n%nThe main two kinds are fluid nukes and vacuum nukes, which will be explained in the following quests. However, there are also other obscure types, such as wrench nukes, which might or might not work in the current version.%n%nThose are memes, but if any new viable type of IC2 nuke is ever introduced, it will be explained in this section.

# Quest: Build the Assembly Line First
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTQ.name=Build the Assembly Line First
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTQ.desc=This branch refers to nuclear fusion. This content is strictly LuV onwards, so you will need the Assembly Line before even starting to think about fusion. It is the most "endgame" content on this quest page, so it's the one left for last.%n%nThe quest you need to complete is in the "Multiblock Goals" tab. There are also fusion-related quests in the LuV, ZPM and UV tabs, amongst others, so check them out when you're there.

# Quest: Improved Fission
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTg.name=Improved Fission
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTg.desc=This branch starts at mid-IV. In this direction, you will find several setups that are related to nuclear fission, the same process that the IC2 nukes do, but in more complex and rewarding ways. Through here, you can get power and breeding byproducts as you would with nukes, but faster and with more variety of options and goals.%n%nThat's right. If you've used IC2 nukes, you might have learned more or less how they work, but the whole system feels a bit dated. That's no surprise, considering that this is base IC2 content and from 10 years ago or more. Whatever additions GTNH gave to those setups, they were minimal in comparison to the general implementation of those nukes. In fact, some of the new content for those was a result of new nuclear fission content that was sort of backported into nukes.%n%nWe have good progression standards here, though. Once you've reached IV, LuV and so on, you will be able to use more advanced ways to work with Thorium and Uranium! These fuels are almost always the focus of the whole thing, with Plutonium coming in from time to time, but each new reactor will demand them to be supplied in a different way for things to work properly. The power generating reactors featured here are the LFTR, the THTR and the Naq-related reactors.%n%nFinally, this questline features many different multis and setups that are often unrelated to each other. Instead of forcing you to build a full LFTR setup before getting access to the THTR, for example, these quests will have simple required tasks, and simple rewards. The optional tasks will have the main expensive crafting, to guide you in building these setups if you're interested in them.

# Quest: Thorium as Early Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTw.name=Thorium as Early Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTw.desc=The very first step into nuclear power is done with Thorium in an Industrialcraft2 nuke. This multiblock already has a good amount of information in the questbook, split between the EV and How to Generate Power pages, so you should look at those if you want even more information that might not be written here. For the sake of not repeating everything, this will be more of a summary.%n%nThorium nukes are better for creating other elements, specifically Lutetium, than for power. The best setup needs the maximum amount of chambers, 6, and a lot of components inside the reactor to burn 10 quad Thorium rods and generate 1920 EU/t, close to one EV amp. If you made 4 of these, you would get close to an IV amp, but this becomes very costly between the total 36 chambers and the recursive crafting of the components inside. The good news is that Thorium is a very cheap fuel, easily mined in the Nether, and recyclable in large amounts from depleted fuel rods.%n%nThis setup, and many others, can be found in the GTNH wiki in the "Nuclear Reactors" page. However, to display it here as best I can, this is the 1920 EU/t Thorium reactor:%n%nOPVOVOPPO%nEOOEOEOOE%nORRORORRO%nORRORORRO%nEOOEOEOOE%nOPPOVOVPO%n%nE -> Component Heat Exchanger (8 needed)%nV -> Component Heat Vent (4 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (26 needed)%nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Thorium (10 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (6 needed)%n%nYou can make this setup, if you wish, but the only required task to continue to the next quest are 10 single Thorium rods.

# Quest: The Path of Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUA.name=The Path of Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUA.desc=The most advanced nuclear technology there is to use in the pack is nuclear fusion. This is an event where two atoms collide with each other and fuse into a different atom while simultaneously generating energy from the plasma, when it is processed. It's impossible to perform in a reactor in real life, because the temperature requirements are too high to maintain any kind of reactor solid with decent efficiency. In GTNH, though, we have better materials.%n%nThe first Fusion Reactor can be built in late LuV, and each tier unlocks some material that is important to progress into the later tiers. Fusion crafting becomes important at that stage, for materials such as Europium, Americium, Neutronium and Oganesson, so you will want to dedicate reactors to specific things later on. More importantly, these materials come out as plasma, which needs to be cooled down to be turned into ingots and plates. On top of that, though, this cooling process is where you can get lots of power!%n%nThe usual process of power generation here is to pump EU into the Fusion Reactor. It needs enough energy to start the reaction, which will then proceed quickly and output good amounts of plasma. This plasma goes into Plasma Turbines, which output huge amounts of EU/t and the cooled down material, ready to be used in further crafting. A beginner's setup can output 640,000 EU/t from one reactor before overclocking, and this grows quickly over time. Fusion power dominates the game for several tiers due to its simplicity, receding away from the powergen setups that were getting more and more complicated with each tier. Two materials fuse into one, plasma comes out, goes into turbine and boom, lots of energy! It's like a steam tier powergen but with big numbers.%n%nTo summarize, fusion is required for progression because of the materials it produces. At the same time, it's very powerful as a source of EU.

# Quest: Building the Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUQ.name=Building the Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUQ.desc=All the regular Fusion Reactors share the same structure. The tier they belong to is determined by the materials used, which become more expensive for each tier. Tier 1 is LuV, tier 2 is ZPM, tier 3 is UV and there's also a tier 4. The structure looks like a huge ring, which barely fits in one chunk, with the controller on the inside of the ring, not the outside.%n%nTo help you with placing all the blocks in the right places, the controller's interface shows a diagram of which blocks go where. To get a 3D view of the placements in the world, use the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector on the controller. If you need even more assistance, there are lots of resources on the internet that explain how it's build, since this is a big GregTech multiblock that is required in many packs, and almost always built the same way.%n%nThe original quests for each reactor tier will be included in the questline, since they provide good information about each tier and are updated.

# Quest: Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUg.name=Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUg.desc=Eventually, the previous nukes will not be big enough. You can make more of them, to get more power, but it's clear that you need something bigger. Bigger, literally. The next step in nuclear fission starts with a bigger multiblock, built on top of the original nuke. By surrounding it with a 5x5x5 cube of Reactor Pressure Vessels, it will become a different type of multiblock, the fluid nuke.%n%nAfter doing this, there's no direct EU generation anymore. The main output of a working fluid nuke is Hot Coolant, a fluid that can be turned into Steam or Superheated Steam in another multi, the Large Heat Exchanger (LHE). Steam means power, as you already know, so the obvious chain of processes here is a fluid nuke into an LHE, and then into Steam Turbines. These added steps are required to make EU from a nuke of this type (or, at least, they're the most popular way of doing it), but this work is rewarded by the final EU/t output of the setup, which is much larger than a regular nuke's output with the same amount of fuel.%n%nThe difference exists because regular nukes actually have a 50%% penalty to EU/t. It's such a big step-up that, in reality, one fluid nuke is enough for IV power, if it's powerful enough. The one in this quest, though, is not that one, because fluid nukes in general have some additional complications that will be harder to deal with it. In fact, for this, you have the option to use Thorium as fuel and still get a good amount of power! What you will need are the fluid nuke blocks, but there is an optional task for this setup that only needs some blocks from the setup.

# Quest: Thorium as Breeding Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUw.name=Thorium as Breeding Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUw.desc=Alternatively, you might choose to only process Thorium for its main output, Lutetium. This is important because Lutetium is required to make Americium in a Fusion Reactor down the line, and that is a recipe you will need to do in order to progress. Your objective is to breed Thorium into Lutetium, which means you might want to focus on a breeder reactor.%n%nWhat is a breeder reactor? In this case, it's an IC2 nuke designed to consume as much Thorium as possible. The main cost here is the amount of chambers or nuke components you'll have to make. If you want to save on Overclocked Heat Vents, make a tower of 0-chamber nukes, each with the following setup:%n%nRPR%nORP%nRPR%nPRP%nRPR%nORP%n%nR -> Single Fuel Rod of Thorium (9 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (2 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (7 needed)%n%nOtherwise, if you have excess Overclocked Heat Vents and want to save up on chambers, turn to this setup:%n%nORORORO%nROEOEOR%nORORORO%nROROROR%nOPOPOPO%nROROROR%n%nE -> Heat Exchanger (2 needed)%nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Thorium (16 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (21 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (3 needed)%n%n(Each of the latter is worth 7x the former in terms of breeding.)%n%nTo complete this quest, you'll need to get Lutetium from one cycle of the any reactor setup. Which setup you choose is up to you, of course.

# Quest: Large Heat Infrastructure
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVA.name=Large Heat Infrastructure
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVA.desc=A required intermediate machine between your fluid nukes and your power is the Large Heat Exchanger (LHE). It takes in a hot fluid, in this case Hot Coolant, and transforms Distilled Water into Steam or Superheated Steam depending on how fast the hot fluid is coming in. It's important to only use Distilled Water here, because the Steam Turbines will output and recycle it back to the LHE.%n%nFor this purpose, you will need around one LHE per fluid nuke if you're doing one of the good setups from the wiki. None of them will reach the maximum flow one LHE can accept, but any setup above 800 HU will give you Superheated Steam, which is more efficient for EU and what you want to get.%n%nIf your setup does not match that 800 HU threshold, you can use a Hot Coolant buffer and set up a redstone latch so that the Hot Coolant flows in fast enough, until the buffer is almost empty. ProjectRed has a special block that acts as the latch, and you will then need two redstone signals that scale with the amount of fluid stored in your buffer tank. One of the signals should be normal, and the other reversed.

# Quest: Fuel Input Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVQ.name=Fuel Input Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVQ.desc=Reactor Platings. These are very important for automation, although their supposed use is not this one. They serve to increase the maximum temperature of the reactor, but that is useless to you because you'll be using heat-neutral setups. Instead, they are simply the cheapest way to fill every slot of your nukes, except for those where fuel rods need to go.%n%nAs you know, the placement of each component is critical to keep the reactor safe. Fuel automation is as simple as just pushing fuel rods into the reactor, but you need to make it so the open slots are the only safe places for the rods. From there, you can use a filter set to the depleted version of the rods you're using to extract them, allowing the exchange to happen seamlessly.%n%nFrom there, you can turn the depleted rods into usable rods by putting them in the Thermal Centrifuge, adding back the fuel that wasn't recycled (each type of rod recycles different amounts of fuel) and the Empty Fuel Rods/Steel Rods.

# Quest: Focus On Power Generation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVg.name=Focus On Power Generation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVg.desc=Each side of this branch will focus on one of the two halves of nuclear fission outputs. This side will focus on generating power from the reactors available here, which is probably why you're here in the first place.%n%nThese setups share one purpose: when they were created, they were meant to bridge the gap between IC2 nukes and fusion, because there was really nothing else worth using beyond fluid nukes if there were no backups available, or redstone automation was too unreliable for vacuum nukes. Not only is there a full 2-tier gap of one single powergen until fusion, but there's also a required power input in order to begin a fusion reaction in the first place. This is both boring and difficult to push through, especially with the Assembly Line in the middle, so here we are.%n%nThe first setup you can put together is the LFTR chain, although only one half of it is available in IV. As such, that is where we will start.

# Quest: Liquid Fluorine Thorium Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVw.name=Liquid Fluorine Thorium Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVw.desc=What a complicated name this is. What does it mean?%n%nWell, it's what is called a molten salt reactor. The Liquid Fluoride part means that the nuclear fuel is actually a liquid, mixed in with fluoride salts. This is a mechanism that makes it more difficult to get the fuel ready for fission, but also makes the process more efficient, gives out more byproducts and also removes the danger of explosion. That's right, nuclear meltdowns are a thing of the past! The molten salt is designed to flow downwards into a hole where it solidifies, in case the reactor has problems, so it's impossible for the fission process to continue into an explosive mess.%n%nThere are three downsides, though. One of them was mentioned just above, the fuel needs more processing to be ready for the LFTR, and more input materials to reach the right mixture. After it goes through the reactor, it comes out as depleted, and this part too requires more processing steps, although it gives out a lot more useful chemicals than the single Lutetium/Plutonium the IC2 nuke depletion process gave. Lastly, the molten salt is very hot and very corrosive, which means it would destroy the materials used to build the IC2 nukes. You will need newer, stronger and more expensive materials to build a reactor, not to mention its much larger size.%n%nThe structure for this multi is truly something else. It has not one, but four required Dynamo Hatches, which should all be the Buffered type, either EV, IV or LuV depending on the fuel being fed into the reactor, with better fuels being unlocked at later progression stages. This means that one LFTR makes either 1 LuV amp, 1 ZPM amp or 1 UV amp while running. It also requires 2 Maintenance and 4 Muffler Hatches, when it has no maintenance problems or pollution output! Mysterious are the workings of this reactor.%n%nOther than this, all the inputs and outputs are fluids. The minimum amount you'll need is 2 inputs and 4 outputs, although one of the outputs comes out over time, and not on recipe finish. This output is Uranium 233, a very rare isotope that can get you deeper into LFTR fuels and more power, hardly obtainable from any other source.

# Quest: First Half of LFTR Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWA.name=First Half of LFTR Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWA.desc=The LFTR processing chain has two halves, with the first being in mid-late IV and the second requiring the Assembly Line and more materials to finish. Aside from power, both of these halves have special outputs that can be helpful for progression, but the second half is most likely the one that holds the most value. Regardless, the full processing chain around the reactor and its fuel will keep outputting everything, so it's worth it to look at what it gives.%n%nLet's start with the LFTR Fuel 1 outputs, after the fuel is consumed in the reactor. U233 and UF6 are both used to make more fuel. U233 will be used until you have Sparge Towers to improve your fuel production, while UF6 is a part of the good fuel recipe that you always want to use. T Salt is processed in the Reactor Processing Unit to yield Proactinium, which decays into even more U233, and then in the Cold Trap to yield more U233 and UF6.%n%nRemember: U233 is the early source of fuel, UF6 is the one you will switch to as you progress.%n%nMeanwhile, U Salt also processes into more fuel, but with a bonus of automated Phosphorous Dust. Unfortunately, you won't get a lot of it, but it is still a breeding output from the nuclear fission and is needed for GT++ alloys and other purposes.%n%nTB Salt is very similar to T Salt, but with higher amounts of the same output and also Beryllium Fluoride, whose output grows into more than what you used when you reach the later parts of the chain. Free Beryllium!

# Quest: Sparge Tower
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWQ.name=Sparge Tower
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWQ.desc=This is the last structure of the LFTR chain, and the only one gated after the Assembly Line. The best LFTR fuel, Fuel 3, is locked after this, and a lot of useful byproducts are only obtainable here as well, so it's important that you build this if you have a working LFTR.%n%nThe structure itself is very similar to a Distillation Tower, but with different blocks. The controller is the most expensive part, but the biggest obstacle is having the Assembly Line; everything after that shouldn't be too difficult. It's recommended that you have more than one tower, but for one focus on making only one.%n%nNote: the height of this tower is not adjustable. It is meant to be a 3x8x3 multiblock with at least 45 Sparge Tower Casings.

# Quest: Fusion Europium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWg.name=Fusion Europium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWg.desc=There are chemical elements that are very important as building materials for high-tier machines. Unfortunately, some of these elements are very hard to find naturally, if at all, and need to be created by hand. They're not alloys, not a mix of materials, but they can be a mix of atoms...%n%nEuropium is the first wall that can be solved by fusion, and only by fusion. It is possible to find it in ores, but even the most complicated magic rituals to get them need some Europium to start, which leaves fusion crafting as the most reliable option to automate the entire process. It is a slow craft, but not an expensive one provided you already have the reactor built, since it uses cheap materials as inputs: Hydrogen and Neodymium. Both of these were used extensively for progression, so you should not have any trouble grabbing several hundreds of each to start this reaction.%n%nIt is important that you gather a lot of inputs. Each time the Fusion Reactor changes recipe, it has a start-up period where it needs a large amount of energy to begin crafting. In the case of Europium, you'll need 150 million EU to start crafting it, and then 7,077,888 EU per ingot of Europium crafted. This does not come out as plasma, so you can't get energy back from it! Additionally, each ingot takes 14.4 seconds to craft, so you can come out with a few stacks of Europium relatively quickly. During this time, you cannot produce plasma for power, so it's a good idea to have a good amount of EU stored, or other powergen setups working in the background, while you craft this material.%n%nWith Europium, you can craft a new kind of boule, wafers and many other things! Check NEI to see what you have unlocked.

# Quest: How Much Power From One Reactor?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWw.name=How Much Power From One Reactor?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWw.desc=A completed Fusion Reactor does not generate any EU on its own, it only consumes it. That said, it's very simple to generate power from plasma, a one-step process of having a Plasma Turbine. These special turbines only work with plasma and are significantly more expensive than the previous ones, requiring Tungstensteel for the body and Naquadah + Naquadah Alloy for the controller.%n%nFirst, how much plasma can one tier 1 reactor produce? The best option for power at this stage is Helium Plasma, with its cheap inputs, and this takes 6.4 seconds per bucket to generate. Since a bucket is worth 81,920,000 EU, that equates to 640,000 EU/t at 100%% efficiency or 960,000 EU/t at 150%%. That is almost 8 ZPM amps, a massive power spike compared to the powergen available before this, with almost no processing before the plasma! For most players, fusion is the only source of power for 3 or 4 tiers, and all other ways of getting power are much more complicated and harder to upscale.%n%nThat said, you will still need multiple turbines to actually consume all of the plasma. At LuV, each turbine can only output the equivalent of 1 ZPM amp, so you will need high-efficiency turbines that don't go above the value of 131,072 EU/t output. Three candidates, in descending order of efficiency, are: Large Rhodium-Palladium at 150%% and 124,740 EU/t, Normal Draconium at 145%% and 121,800 EU/t and Large Tungstencarbide at 140%% and 123,480 EU/t.%n%n[note]Note: the suggestions in this questline might be outdated, and there might be other options that are just as good, if not better. Look through NEI and ask other people, there might be a new setup that can replace the ones in these quests![/note]

# Quest: Optional Tier 1 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXA.name=Optional Tier 1 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXA.desc=Osmium - from Helium and Tungsten. Osmium from the platline is quite power-hungry, which this recipe won't solve, but it will at least help you past the terrible output rate of Osmium. You can get it faster from here as long as you can keep supplying Tungsten and power.%n%nSunnarium - from Helium + Glowstone. If you've had difficulty in getting lots of Sunnarium after the Molecular Transformer nerf, you can try this for your Solar Panels and other things. Glowing Coral processing with UUM is recommended, though.%n%nBoron - from Lithium and Helium. If you haven't automated this yet, for Borosilicate Glass for example, this is one way to do it. You will need lots of glass for the Mega Blast Furnace and other big multis of the kind, so it's not a useless recipe.

# Quest: Powering-up Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXg.name=Powering-up Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXg.desc=The previous setup's EU/t might not have impressed you. You have enough materials to put together the fluid nuke structure, but you want something more than what you've seen before. What kind of setup is powerful enough to output several IV amps, and sustain a developed IV base on its own? That sort of setup is shown in this quest, but it requires more multiblocks, and therefore more expense than the previous quest's chain. The fuel is the same, Uranium, so at this point it's certainly the least of your worries, until you try to automate the fuel input, at least.%n%nThe components inside the nuke get more and more complicated, so at this point I'm going to ask you to look at the wiki, under the Nuclear Reactors page ([url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Nuclear_Reactors[/url]), and scroll down to the fluid nuke setups, specifically the 1352 HU, 2 Quad Uranium and 1408, 3 Quad Uranium, 1 Dual Uranium ones. The main difference between these two setups is that the first needs Iridium Neutron Reflectors, which are quite expensive if you haven't done the platline yet, while the second doesn't use them but is harder to automate due to having more than one type of rod.%n%nWhat's the final EU/t output, at 170%% turbine efficiency? 36288 and 38016 EU/t, respectively.%n%nAfter automating the nuke itself, there is still more to do, though. The LHE is required, as usual, but these setups cause something new to happen: the LHE starts outputting Superheated Steam, due to the high flow of hot coolant that it receives, which means that you need two sets of turbines instead of one. This type of steam must go into Large HP Steam Turbines, which use a good amount of Tungstensteel for the controller and stacks of Titanium for the casings. After those, it goes into the usual Large Steam Turbines, and the process is complete.%n%nThere is yet another new thing to worry about, in case all of this wasn't enough: the Steam flow is very high, higher than before, which means it's likely you will need 3 or more of each turbine type, further compounding on the costs you'll have here.%n%nYour best option for a turbine in the IV tier is the HSS-E at 170%% turbine efficiency.%n%nThere is another turbine at 180%% efficiency with the HSS-S however; this turbine requires a robust platinium line completed to spare the resources for it.

# Quest: Vacuum Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXw.name=Vacuum Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXw.desc=What's the next step, running nuclear reactors in a perfect vacuum? That would be pretty funny, I'd like to see that.%n%nDisclaimer: this last step is not very stable. It's very risky to do it in servers with no backups, because it relies on redstone circuits to keep the reactor from exploding. Use multiple failsafes to guarantee safety. Never ever build a vacuum nuke in a Thermos server!%n%nVacuum nukes are an interesting GTNH-specific setup. They use only three components: fuel rods, platings to fill the empty slots for automation purposes, and coolant cells. Those cells you have used to make Energy Hatches, for example, they're used here to keep the reactor from overheating and exploding. The main difference this setup has is that these cells are consumable, and will wear out over time. You will need to add fresh cells into the reactor to keep running it safely, but the crux of the show is that you don't need to make new ones - you just need to cool them down again.%n%nThe Vacuum Freezer! That's why it's called a vacuum nuke! Elementary, my dear Steve. This kind of setup relies on using EU to refill the coolant cells, so to speak, and get much more EU from the reactor than you spend to keep it running. However, the redstone automation for this is quite tricky. If you just try it blindly, it might take you a long time to figure it out, and it might have explosive results. Check the Vacuum Reactors page on the wiki ([url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Vacuum_Reactor[/url]) if you want a detailed guide that goes far beyond what I could write in this quest description.%n%nThis quest task is for the last setup shown in the wiki, specifically the 8720-43600 EU, 40 Quad Uranium setup. As the title implies, it can produce up to 43600 EU/t, but it will require multiple filters and failsafes to run it safely. The bonus, compared to fluid nukes, is that the LHE + turbine setup is not necessary for these high output numbers.

# Quest: Can We Get Uranium Here?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYA.name=Can We Get Uranium Here?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYA.desc=Yes, you can. In fact, you can get it much earlier than EV, but the speed at which you get it can vary wildly, depending on how you approach this problem. Uranium is the main upgrade to Thorium in nukes, with a lot more power to give and a different useful breeding byproduct, but you need about 3 stacks of Uranium 238 to set up the most powerful basic IC2 Uranium Nuke.%n%nHow do you get it, though? The one answer is, you get it from Thorium. Looking at NEI, the Thorium ore processing has a chance to give Uranium dusts, which you can use as fuel, but this happens very slowly, especially considering that Thorium is a rare ore in the Nether, even if each ore block gives 4 crushed dust. The reality seems to be that fast Uranium only happens when you can mine from t2 planets, but this is not the only way. There is a secret, and this secret involves IC2 crops.%n%nHow does it work? Well, it's simple. The IC2 crop that corresponds to Thorium, the God of Thunder, can quadruple each Crushed Thorium Ore into 4 Purified Thorium Ore, but it also outputs, in fluid form, one Uranium Ingot! This means that each Thorium Ore gives you 4 Uranium Ingots, and with around 42 ore, you can do one cycle of that big reactor setup. God of Thunder needs the ore under it, though, so make sure you save some for that purpose.%n%nEV Uranium nukes are an achievement intended mostly for IC2 crop users, so this quest won't demand something like that. Still, it's a useful secret, so here it is. Additionally, the Uranium crop quest in the questbook awards you with 32 Pitchblende when you complete it, which might prove useful for both for quadrupling Uranium and getting Radium for Radon!

# Quest: Uranium Basic Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYQ.name=Uranium Basic Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYQ.desc=The big brother to the Thorium nuke, the Uranium nuke. The biggest setup you can put together for a single IC2 Nuclear Reactor uses 7 Quad Uranium Rods, or 28 single rods. This amounts to almost 3 stacks of Uranium 238 (U238), a difficult amount to get from Thorium but much easier to get from the green ores found in Phobos. The setup is very similar to the previous one, but with some important differences. What are they?%n%nThe first one is the fuel. These fuel rods use a mixture of U238 and a bit of U235, which is rarer. To get U235, you can gamble on the chance of getting the dust from processing some of the related ores, which might be good enough, but it's also possible to use Thaumcraft to convert 9 nuggets of U238 to 7 nuggets of U235, without needing a lot of Thaumcraft progress. Assembling this fuel and putting it into rods gets it ready to be used for power, with more EU/t but less burn time compared to Thorium, 50000 seconds for Thorium compared to 20000 seconds for Uranium.%n%nThe second difference in the nuke setup. Uranium eats up more per rod, so a different arrangement inside the nuke is required. For the highest EU/t in this situation, 4200 EU/t, the setup is:%n%nRVOEOOVOP%nPVOOVOORO%nPOROOROOV%nVOOVOOVOP%nOROOROORO%nPOVPOVPOV%n%nE -> Component Heat Exchanger (1 needed)%nV -> Component Heat Vent (11 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (28 needed)%nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Uranium (7 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (7 needed)%n%nWhen the fuel rods get repleted, you can reprocess them to get 3/4 of the U235 back, and also a bit of Plutonium.

# Quest: Further IC2 Nuke Potential
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYg.name=Further IC2 Nuke Potential
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYg.desc=An observant nuclear scientist might have seen many more options for IC2 nukes than those mentioned in the quests up to this point. Thorium, Uranium, Thorium, Uranium... what about all of these other things, what do they do?%n%nUnfortunately, this is where the copying of builds ends. The nuke research that has been done is almost all about the fuel rods that existed from base IC2, namely the Thorium, Uranium and MOX ones. Almost all the others were added with GTNH, and they are more or less ignored by most players. However, not all of them are useless! To see why, keep reading.%n%nGoodGenerators has added two new pairs of Uranium and Plutonium rods: High Density, and Excited. Both of these use a lot more of the element per rod, to the extent where you'll need stacks and stacks of each to run a single nuke, which means that these are fuels for later in progression, when you have stockpiled a lot of U238. The main difference is that High Density rods output a lot more EU/t with the same heat output, whereas the Excited rods do output a lot more heat than usual. This means that the former are good for vacuum nukes, while the latter are good for fluid nukes. This is true because vac nukes want more EU/t from rods with less heat, to make the coolant cells last longer, while fluid nukes produce Hot Coolant directly from the amount of heat dissipated into the reactor. The Plutonium versions also have MOX-like behavior, while the Uranium ones don't.%n%nThis is not the end of high-powered nukes, though. There is a special, one-of-a-kind fuel rod called The Core, and there is a single vac nuke setup in the wiki using these things that outputs 7.906.206 EU/t, or about 3 amps of UHV. A truly ridiculous number, matching the truly ridiculous cost of making the fuel itself. This is a setup for a time in which you shouldn't be using IC2 nukes anymore, a true challenge for the mad nuclear scientist.%n%nWhat else is there? Unfortunately, not much. Every other fuel rod is largely useless. Tiberium rods can breed Zirconium and Xenon, if you need them, Lithium breeds Tritium and the Naquadah rods are unbelievably bad at generating power, which many other better reactors to use the Naquadah in. In terms of power, nothing else is worth using.

# Quest: High Density Vacuum Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYw.name=High Density Vacuum Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYw.desc=Throw more U238 at it!%n%nIf you ever thought that a vacuum nuke doesn't burn through Uranium fast enough, this one is for you. High Density Uranium, or HDU, outputs twice the EU of the regular Uranium rods, and lasts for 70000 seconds instead of 20000. The heat output, like mentioned before, is the same, so the actual effect of using these rods in a vacuum nuke setup is that your final EU/t per nuke is multiplied by 2, and rods will need to be replaced less often, but the U238 consumption per cycle is a lot higher.%n%nThis also helps if you aren't automating the fuel rod input, since each one lasts longer. It's better if it's automated, but there's no danger of explosions if this part is done manually, so it's technically safe, as long as your EU buffer doesn't start complaining from lack of input.%n%nAs the last step before using The Core, you have High Density Plutonium. This HDP has MOX-like behavior, so it can output even more EU/t than HDU, up to several LuV amps per nuke, but you need to keep it running at high temperatures, which means even more risk! There is no such thing as too much safety, if you try to put one of these together.

# Quest: Plutonium 239
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZA.name=Plutonium 239
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZA.desc=Red as an ingot, white as a blob. These are the same element, and the same isotope, even if they don't seem like it.%n%nPlutonium is a major part of nuclear fission reaction, mainly as a product of Uranium fissile fuel, when an atom in the mix captures a neutron and then emits an electron and an anti-neutrino. After several hours in the reactor, the fuel is considered depleted and there's enough Plutonium in it to separate the two through thermal centrifuging, a basic and inefficient way to do nuclear reprocessing. Later on, it's possible to improve your methods of handling spent nuclear fuel, but this is the first way you get this nuclear byproduct.%n%nIf you've made Quantum Eyes, you might know one of the main uses of Plutonium: to get Radium. By having enough of it to serve as a catalyst in the reaction, you can convert Uranium to Radium in small quantities without losing any Plutonium. Since you need 6 ingots, you will have to do 3 cycles of the setup shown in the quest before this one, or more if you're running smaller Uranium nukes. However, there is another useful thing you can use this for at this time: more nuclear fuel.%n%nNot just more nuclear fuel, but a different, more complex but also more powerful nuclear fuel. It's known as MOX fuel, and it is essentially a mix of Uranium and Plutonium. The catch is that all the Plutonium spent on creating the fuel is returned to you when reprocessing the depleted rods, alongside the extra you usually get, but not the Uranium return. To source a nuke of this kind, you will need more than 6 ingots.

# Quest: Excited Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZQ.name=Excited Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZQ.desc=This quest is after the vacuum nuke one because the fuel required to do a setup like this is harder to get. Whereas the previous rods were made with compressed Uranium, this fuel needs that same material to then be further processed in GoodGenerators machines, namely the Neutron Activator, to make Excited Uranium Liquid Fuel. It is directly usable in the Naquadah Reactor, with more fuel efficiency there, but you might not be able to build it yet, since it's post-fusion. Instead, you can use said fuel here.%n%nBefore attempting this, you need to know all the mechanics related to the fluid nuke. In fact, this quest won't even have any required tasks, given how challenging it is to create a good setup of this kind. At the time of writing this quest, there is no nuke simulator that supports the Excited Fuel Rods, which means you'll have to first test in Creative mode and gather whatever results you get from there.%n%nThe basis for this setup is simple: Excited Uranium Fuel Rods, the only kind you should consider for this, output 16x more heat than the regular ones, which is a lot more Hot Coolant output if you can send all this heat to the reactor to be turned into power. Only the heat matters, which means that extra EU/t based on temperature will do nothing here. Throw as many rods as you can at this nuke without overheating, that is the challenge.%n%nWhat then? You will surely need many multis if you want to process LuV amps of power, unless you choose some more advanced options. The LHE upgrades into the EHE, the Extreme Heat Exchanger, and this new multi can output either Superheated or Supercritical Steam. For the former, use XL Steam Turbines to process the ludicrous amount of Steam you will be getting. For the latter, you need special turbines.

# Quest: Nukes - Summarized
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZg.name=Nukes - Summarized
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZg.desc=IC2 nukes will fall off when you arrive at fusion energy, for the most part. Although the highest EU/t numbers obtained from these newer, more powerful cells haven't been calculated yet, it is more likely that you will be using them to process the excited materials instead of focusing your powergen on them.%n%nThat said, it is possible to push them very far by using a bigger Heat Exchanger (there are two kinds) and XL Turbines, if going fluid, or by putting together a lot of vacuum nukes. If you want to choose the latter ones, due to their direct EU/t, then there's one last step: The Core.%n%nThese are super-powerful fuel rods that can create UHV setups, as long as you cool them down with the most powerful coolant cells there are. A setup for this exists in the wiki, but the most difficult part will be the redstone automation. These babies will turn your base into a mini Sun, if you let them, so you best have practiced your redstone skills!

# Quest: MOX Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZw.name=MOX Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZw.desc=Upon gathering more Plutonium, you can try building a MOX nuke, the most powerful of the basic nukes. It is a 6-chamber, like usual, and it takes U238 as before, but it outputs close to 6820 EU/t while only using 5 quad rods instead of 7. How is this possible? The answer is... MOX.%n%nMOX means mixed-oxide, which is the name given to the mix of Uranium and Plutonium. In here, rods with this fuel are special in the sense that they don't output a specific amount of EU/t from the usual nuke mechanics. On top of those, it also reacts to the heat of the reactor, generating more energy the hotter it is. To compensate, these rods last only half the time that the Uranium fuel rods do, but their total EU is higher if they are active in very hot reactors. This imposes an obvious problem - hot reactors are not good for your base.%n%nThere is one standardized way of dealing with this: heat-neutral reactors. What this means is that the reactor's temperature does not change while it's active, because the components inside are not interacting with the reactor's temperature value, only with the value of other components like the fuel rods themselves. This limits the type of components you can use, and you'll find that Advanced Heat Vents are now required (the overclocked ones interact with the reactor itself). However, at the same time, you can use any fuel rod to heat the reactor up to a high temperature and then activate a setup of this kind, which ensures safety and efficiency in MOX nukes.%n%nVAAV%nARRA%nVAAV%nVAAV%nARRA%nVAAV%n%nA - Advanced Heat Exchanger (12 needed)%nV - Component Heat Vent (8 needed)%nR - Dual Fuel Rod of MOX (4 needed)%n%n1200-2730 EU/t%n%n(This setup is the most efficient per MOX fuel rod, if you're short on fuel, which you shouldn't be if you're doing a MOX setup)%n%nAEAVPVAEA%nVARAVARAV%nAVAVAVAVA%nEAVARAVAE%nARAVAVARA%nVAEAVAEAV%n%nA - Advanced Heat Vent (26 needed)%nE - Component Heat Exchanger (6 needed)%nV - Component Heat Vent (16 needed)%nR - Quad Fuel Rod of MOX (5 needed)%nP - Reactor Plating (1 needed)%n%n3000-6825 EU/t%n%n(This setup is the most efficient per Advanced Heat Vent)

# Quest: Nuclear Fuel Processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaA.name=Nuclear Fuel Processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaA.desc=The previous reactor is useless on its own, unfortunately. Even if you have built it fully, there's no way to get fuel that it will accept without making another multi that mixes and processes several chemical mixtures into one, the molten salt that generates all that nuclear energy in the LFTR.%n%nThe multi's name is Reactor Fuel Processing Plant (RFPP), although it's easier to call it the Fuel Refinery. It's a mid-late IV multiblock, like the LFTR, especially due to needing 2 ZPM circuits for the Computer Cube used in the controller's recipe. The other casings are similar to what you've made before, and the tooltip gives a good description of what exactly is needed to build the Fuel Refinery.%n%nWhere to put each casing? The bottom two layers are 3x3, and they take the Structural Blocks. On top of the second layer, in the middle block, make a tower of 5 Fluid Containment Blocks, and then cover these with Sealant Blocks, like you would do in a Multiblock Miner. However, the second layer of the 5, from the bottom, uses Reactor Shielding Blocks, 4 of them there instead of the Sealant Blocks. Use the Hologram Projector for assistance if you're having trouble.%n%nWhen it's fully built, you can focus on the recipes. Out of the 5 that are available, you can only do one at this time, the Fuel 1 recipe. To make this fuel, you need molten U235, but also Lithium Fluoride, Beryllium Fluoride and Zirconium Tetrafluoride. Each of the these elements can be obtained with relative ease, each in their own way, but Fluorine is the main part of all this, the main component of the molten salt, so it's a good idea to have a decent source of it. However, the LFTR fuels are also very, very energy dense, so each bucket of Fluorine can bring you a long way.%n%nIf you're looking through NEI, your first response might be "There are no recipes for these fluorides other than reprocessing the depleted fuels! How am I supposed to make these?". The answer is in the dusts: you have to craft the dusts and then fluid extract them into the fluids. There is a spreadsheet which has all the steps in crafting and reprocessing ([url]https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1JGSt5-ELdra6emngUc7XvKSJc-_-RO0yreRIbOrx0/edit?usp=sharing[/url]), to help with how complicated this chain is.%n%nJust make sure you remember, each bucket of fuel is worth many millions, perhaps even billions of EU! Don't let the 207M EU cost per bucket of Fuel 1 discourage you, it turns into much more energy in the LFTR. Besides, this first fuel is just a stepping stone, so don't worry about fully automating everything just yet, the final setup is different from this one.

# Quest: Inputs and Outputs in the LFTR
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaQ.name=Inputs and Outputs in the LFTR
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaQ.desc=Assuming you have both the LFTR and the Fuel Refinery built, and the inputs for the fuel available to be used, you can power up the reactor and leave it running. The first fuel you can use will work with 4 IV Energy Dynamos to output 4 IV amps, as long as the reactor runs, and each cycle lasts for 100 seconds (you can see the recipes on NEI, there's a tab dedicated to the 3 fuels the LFTR can run and what you get from them).%n%nWhat about everything else? The entire setup has 2 inputs and 4 outputs. One of the inputs is any of the 3 possible fuels, the other input is Lithium Tetrafluoroberyllate (LTFB). On the output side, there's one constant: U233 is output in small quantities at random, averaging 10 seconds per output. There are two other outputs, U Salt and UF6, that come from every fuel, although better fuels output more of these per cycle. Finally, T Salt or TB Salt can be outputted, the first from the first fuel and the second from the other two, with TB being more valuable than T. All of these are meant to be processed in order to reach better LFTR fuels, and also useful breeding byproducts.%n%nStarting with the first fuel, every bucket of it will need 2 buckets of LTFB, last 1000 seconds and output a total of 655,536,000 EU at 32,768 EU/t. After this, you will have 367L of U233 on average, 250L of U Salt, 500L of T Salt and 5L of UF6. As you can tell, this is a slow burner, and one bucket of each of these fluids is worth a lot!

# Quest: First Steps in Reprocessing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMag.name=First Steps in Reprocessing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMag.desc=You now have 4 different fluid outputs running away from your LFTR. Each of them needs specific attention, and all of them are useful.%n%nWhere to start looking? The best way to start is at the end, which is to say, the Fuel Refinery. You want to upgrade to the better fuels as soon as possible, and each one has 2 recipes: one with 4 inputs, similar to the recipe you've already done, and one with 2 inputs, focusing on LFTR Fuel Base. The 2-input recipes produce 10x the fuel, so they're much better, but you can't use this recipe alone. The Fuel Base can only be made from reprocessing depleted fuel, and you don't get enough of it to make the same amount of fuel spent. If you perfectly reprocess any of the first two fuels to get Fuel Base, you will come out short and run out of fuel.%n%nGiven that, your strategy will be to use two Fuel Refineries, one for each Fuel 2 recipe, and then change them to Fuel 3 once you've built the Assembly Line, which is required to build the final multiblocks in this line. For Fuel 2, get as much Fuel Base as you can from this chain - EBF <- DT <- RPU <- LFTR and put it into one of the refineries, while using the second one to top off on the remaining fuel you need to keep the LFTR going. You can limit the UF4 on the second refinery to not make too much fuel there, or just turn it on and off, and use as much of the better recipe as possible. You will be able to use the better recipe 100%% of the time, but only after building a Sparge Tower.%n%nAdditional details on the other outputs you can get from reprocessing can be found on the breeding side of this questline branch.

# Quest: Second Half of LFTR Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaw.name=Second Half of LFTR Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaw.desc=There are two gas inputs that the Sparge Tower accepts: Helium and Fluorine. Each one works on different depleted salts (U Salt, T Salt, TB Salt) in a specific way. Helium works with U Salt to make the most valuable byproducts, while Fluorine works with the other two salts to make other byproducts and TF4, which is required to make the LFTR Fuel 3. Here, we'll focus on Helium and U Salt, and the other recipes will be covered on the powergen side of the branch.%n%nAll the U Salt you get from the LFTR, from any fuel, can be run through the Sparge Tower. It's an additional step that is slow, yet rewarding. The recipe is HV-tier, but it's recommended that you overclock it, and maybe even build multiple towers to accelerate it. All the U Salt you have should pass through these, because sparging it outputs almost every noble gas! Xenon, Neon, Argon, Krypton and Radon will be outputted over time, precious gases to speed up EBF recipes and save up lots of energy, and also for the Void Miner. Radon, on the other hand, is required to make Quantum Eyes, Quantum Stars and many other important items.%n%nEven though you get many gases, the speed at which you'll get them isn't great, since it depends on the speed at which LFTR fuel is being consumed. This should not be your only source of these gases, but it is a completely EU-free way to get them, considering the amount of energy the LFTR produces.

# Quest: Faster Lutetium Excitement
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbA.name=Faster Lutetium Excitement
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbA.desc=This quest is late LuV.%n%nYou might have read before that Lutetium is necessary as an input for fusion crafting. In a tier 2 fusion reactor, Lutetium + Chrome = Americium, a required material for many required crafts. Lutetium is a material that is obtained exclusively from breeding, so you're in the right place to find ways to get it.%n%nThe very first method, EV's IC2 Thorium nukes, is the cheapest, but also the slowest. Each fuel rod takes 50000 seconds to deplete, almost 14 hours, with half of a Lutetium Dust per depleted rod. Highly stackable designs, such as the 2-chamber 11 quad rod one, will grant you 22 dust per cycle. After building 10 of those, the rate is still 16 dust per hour. This processing speed isn't good enough to keep progressing forever, and there is no need to make more towers of breeder nukes.%n%nYour 5 main options are:%n%n1) HTGR - fastest but also quite expensive multiblock reactor, unfortunately it requires purified thorium232 you will need to purify it first%n2) Lutetium bees - if you started bees getting it should be quite easy%n3) Spamming IC2 nuclear reactors%n4) Distilling Heavy Naquadah Fuel%n5) Summoning meteors

# Quest: Exciting Liquid Nuking
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbw.name=Exciting Liquid Nuking
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbw.desc=With the reactor built, it's time to automate the fuel and additives, since there are additives this time. They are optional, so let's begin with the required inputs.%n%nLiquid Air is trivial to automate: it's a Vacuum Freezer job. Input energy and Air and output Liquid Air, there are quests for this. The fuels themselves are more complicated, but the three of them follow a similar set of recipes. First, you grab a lot of the radioactive element (Thorium, Uranium or Plutonium), wrap it in a specific foil and then put in an Implosion Compressor to make very dense nuggets. These are into the High Density items you need, which are then mixed with specific dusts to create the basic fuel fluid.%n%nThis part is where it becomes complicated, though. To get the energy out of this radioactive fluid, you need to activate it. Thorium is done by mixing with Helium Plasma (t1 fusion), while the other two are made directly in the Fusion Reactor (t2 fusion). The activated fuels can be thrown directly in the reactor to produce EU, at a very slow pace. Your bottleneck should be the main radioactive element, so make sure you can source it fast enough.%n%nBeing here, you should have a Large Naquadah Reactor ready to go. However, it is true that these Excited Fuels can be used to make fuel rods for IC2 nukes, with much larger heat outputs meant for fluid nukes. You can try to use them there, but there are no simulated setups of any kind for those rods, so it's going to be a very experimental setup if you ever decide to make it.

# Quest: The Fission Finale
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcA.name=The Fission Finale
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcA.desc=Here we are, at the end of fission.%n%nAt this time, you have more than entered the fusion tiers. In fact, the last fusion setups go as deep as t2 fusion, so you might be running both fission and fusion at the same time, although the latter is generally easier and more efficient once the structure is built.%n%nOne of the ultimate goals of fission is a filled HTGR, or its younger brother, the THTR, two very expensive multis that can grant you essentially infinite power or breeding products. However, the Naquadah Generator that has those excited nuclear fuels can do much more! The Naquadah fuel line is the reason why it was created, and it can replace t3 fusion and beyond by condensing powergen even more than fusion did, and replace the turbine spam.%n%nThose fuels aren't exactly nuclear fission, nor fusion, and more of a chemical line, so they were not included here. If interested, look at NEI to see what they have to offer.

# Quest: Pebble Reactor Fuels and Outputs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcQ.name=Pebble Reactor Fuels and Outputs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcQ.desc=Thorium, Uranium and Plutonium. There you go, quest done, onwards. I do find it kind of funny how it always goes back to these. Why is it that when there are problems, it's always you three?%n%nMaking the pebbles for any of these elements is a multi-step process. To get them, you need to throw in huge amount of the main radioactive fuel alongside some materials used to make the outer shell, namely Carbon, Silicon, and Graphite Dust.%n%nFor a full reactor, you will need thousands of stacks of each of these, much more than quest tasks could ask for. Anyways, the depleted pebbles can be centrifuged to recover most of the materials used to reach the final pebbles (Silicon, Graphite, Carbon), alongside a smaller chance at getting the main nuclear material for each kind of pebble. On top of that, you will get the breeding outputs: Lutetium from Thorium, Krypton from Uranium, Xenon from Plutonium.

# Quest: Tin Plasma From T2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcg.name=Tin Plasma From T2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcg.desc=Once you upgrade your Fusion Reactor to tier 2, you gain access to a better recipe for power generation, which is Tin Plasma. Helium-3 is used, as it was before, but now with Silver, which you can automate in a million ways. The processing speed is slightly higher than before, but the fuel value of this plasma is much higher than what you were using before, at 150,000,000 EU per bucket. This impressive fuel value means that the max power output of a single t2 reactor at 100%% fuel efficiency is 2,700,000 EU/t, and with the turbines you can use here, you can twice as much as that or even more!%n%nTo utilize all of the plasma, you will be using 10 or more turbines with good rotors. Before doing that, though, it's a good idea to step back and test your turbines with this plasma, preferably in Creative mode, because the fuel value is so high that one liter of plasma is worth 150,000 EU at 100%% efficiency. If you set the input rate to anything higher than 2 L/t, you will go above the ZPM Dynamo limit, and even 2 L/t will be too high if the turbine's efficiency is 174%% or above! Until you upgrade your hatches, you might once again be stuck will less power output or efficiency than you'd like. There's only one way to fix that.

# Quest: The Overclocking of the Ages
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdA.name=The Overclocking of the Ages
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdA.desc=Tin Plasma is more power-dense, but it's not a required upgrade. As you scale up, it's always worth it to look back at Helium Plasma for how renewable it is, something that Tin Plasma has unfortunately lost a bit of. It can be made renewable, but one of its strengths was in the Molecular Transformer recipe that transformed Tin, the output, into Silver, one of the inputs. This recipe is now in the new Molecular Transformer Multiblock and does not scale as well as before. Therefore it might be easier to use void miners for silver or to stick with Helium Plasma.%n%nAs per usual, running a lower tier recipe awards you with an overclock. Unlike other GT machines, though, the Fusion Reactor's overclock doubles both speed and energy consumption, which maintains the energy consumption per recipe but gives only half of a speed boost that a perfect overclock (like the Large Chemical Reactor) would. This means that a t2 reactor can produce exactly twice as much power as a t1 in the form of plasma output, but the upgrade is bigger than that when taking better turbines into account.%n%nWhat comes next, then? Tier 3 is what is next. There is no new fuel to be used here, your options are either 4x speed on Helium or 2x speed on Tin. After getting the cheaper Americium recipe that's available on t3, you will be able to make more reactors at a cheaper cost, but this lack of fuel upgrade will still be problematic in your progression. You will have to find other ways to upgrade your power, which will be revealed after this.

# Quest: Fusing Americium and Tritanium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdQ.name=Fusing Americium and Tritanium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdQ.desc=A t2 Fusion Reactor unlocks more fusion materials, some of which will again be necessary to progress into the next tiers. One of them is Americium, which is the reason for all the Lutetium worry until now: both are required, because one makes the other. The recipe also needs Chrome as input, but that should be much easier to get than Lutetium or the power needed per bucket of Molten Americium, which is almost 300M EU.%n%nYou will need many stacks of this material for your future progression, but your first goal should be to make 141 ingots (check the ZPM "Making Americium" quest for details). However, if you have extra Lutetium, you should make more Americium, you will not regret doing this when you need more of it later.%n%nAnother useful material you unlock at t2 is Tritanium, which is different from Trinium. The source of this material is fusion, and the inputs to make it are Duranium and Titanium. If you haven't made Duranium before, you'll see that it needs a lot of Radon, almost 8x the amount of Tritanium you end up with. For this, you should already have the Radon loop automated, that step is very important for this.%n%nYou will need Tritanium to progress, just as you need Americium, so it's a good idea to batch craft both of these in your new t2 Fusion Reactor so you don't have to go back to these recipes soon.

# Quest: Bismuth Plasma For Soldering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdg.name=Bismuth Plasma For Soldering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdg.desc=Who in their right mind would use a plasma to solder things together? That's mental. Well, all the progression at this point is mental, that's all there is to it.%n%nIt's not directly with the plasma, though. It is once again about the Mutated Living Solder, and now its fluid inputs: Tin Plasma and Bismuth Plasma. These are the two main components of the previous solders, and that's the reason they're needed now. Tin Plasma is t2 fusion, and you might have already made a lot of it to generate power, but Bismuth Plasma is t3, with the inputs being Zinc Plasma and Molten Tantalum, which is actually Tritium, Copper and Tantalum in the end.%n%nThe recipes are cheap in power, you just have to make sure the inputs are there. Tritium can be centrifuged from Deuterium, which itself can be centrifuged from Hydrogen Gas, and the other two inputs are easy. You will need 18000L of each plasma for 40000L of the solder, or almost half the amount for each.

# Quest: Optional Tier 2 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdw.name=Optional Tier 2 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdw.desc=Uranium - from Gold + Aluminium or Magnesium + Mercury. You should have already left nuclear fission behind, but if you ever need Uranium, you can use this? You should have a lot of it already.%n%nPlutonium - from Helium + Uranium. A quick 1:1 conversion from U238 to P239, but you already have access to Plutonium Ore, so this is probably pointless.%n%nCalifornium - from Beryllium + Plutonium. Mostly used for Oganesson, not very useful for anything else, and you won't need a lot of this if replicating Oganesson is an option.%n%n(These 3 recipes makes a possible chain to Oganesson, which can be made in t3 fusion. Not that they are necessarily the best option to get it.)%n%nExcited Uranium Fuel - from Hydrogen and Uranium Liquid Fuel. This is for the Naquadah Generator, which is late ZPM, or possibly to use in IC2 nukes, although that's the worse option. Basically, it's accelerated nuclear fission, if you have interest in that.%n%nExcited Plutonium Fuel - from Hydrogen and Plutonium Liquid Fuel. Same as above, but from Plutonium. This means it's more expensive, but also more powerful, and can yield a lot of power in the Naquadah Generator with the right additives.

# Quest: Optional Tier 3 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMeQ.name=Optional Tier 3 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMeQ.desc=Indium - from Lithium + Silver. This is one of the most important optional fusion recipes, given how difficult Indium is to get. Your options are to either replicate it, make it with fusion, obtain it from the naquadria line, or obtain it from processing sphalerite ore.%n%n(You can make Indium in other ways, of course, but this is a relatively popular, non-forced fusion recipe)%n%nOganesson - from Calcium + Californium. This is the best noble gas of them all, and a very power-hungry recipe compared to most. However, Oganesson will save you power on EBF recipes, reducing recipe time more than any other fluid, and it also boosts Void Miners to their maximum speed. Replicating it might be better, if you have the right setup with GT++ multis.%n%nAmericium - from Hydrogen + Plutonium 241. This is the cheaper Americium recipe that was promised to you in t2, and it no longer needs Lutetium. You should be able to get both of the inputs very easily, so enjoy your cheaper Americium!%n%nNeutronium - from Naquadria + Americium. Neutronium fusion? You probably won't need to use this, but it is a source other than ores that you can try.

# Quest: Smaller Fusion Is Bigger
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMeg.name=Smaller Fusion Is Bigger
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMeg.desc=It's not smaller, it's compact!%n%nCompact Fusion. If you've been looking for a big multiblock to put together, you have arrived at a very neat thing. There's hardly anything that could beat its size, except for a max height Mega Distillation Tower, but this is instead a wide multi instead of a tall one. It is so wide, in fact, that it cannot fit in one chunk, and instead covers a 3x3 chunk space! Make sure you follow the instructions and the hologram properly, and jump in joy when you have one of these built.%n%nYou can choose one of four tiers for this reactor, in the same way as the normal Fusion Reactors. The Compact controller will need 48 of the regular controllers in the same tier, plus some other materials, and more than 2 thousand blocks in the structure, which are conveniently detailed in the tooltip. It is much bigger than the previous reactors, but it also has a huge number of parallels, starting at 64x with MK1 and ending at a maximum of 320x with t5!%n%nThis is the go-to when you have found yourself deep into MK3 fusion, perhaps even MK4, and you find yourself running short on power. Instead of making a tower of reactors, why not make one of these? The only power issue that you'll have after getting it done is the amount of turbines you will need to eat up all the plasma. You probably know about the XL Plasma Turbine, but you should also know that they force huge penalties on most plasmas, including Helium and Tin, if you use good turbine materials like Infinity. Do you remember those fusion chains mentioned in previous quests? This is the time for them. Check the "How to Generate Power" tab for more details.%n%n[note]Compacts follow different overclocking rules, needing double the startup power and double the voltage instead of just the voltage.[/note]

# Quest: Thorium Tetrafluoride and Fuel 3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMew.name=Thorium Tetrafluoride and Fuel 3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMew.desc=Whether you've mathed it out from NEI, looked at the spreadsheet or done something else, you might have figured something out: Fuel 3 is better in every way. More power, more byproducts, more everything. However, both recipes for it use Thorium Tetrafluoride (TF4), and the source of this is salt sparging, done in the Sparge Tower. Not only that, but Fuel 3 can only be consumed by having 4 LuV Buffered Dynamo Hatches in the LFTR, which means that it's a fair bit away from the previous steps in this chain.%n%nOnce you've made it there, though, you can start working on getting this fuel. To make it, you will need at least one Sparge Tower dedicated to using Fluorine, with T Salt or TB Salt (TB Salt is better, get it from Fuel 2). There is a recipe that uses Helium, but it's not required for Fuel 3 and is meant for byproducts, so the quest for it is in the breeding half of this branch. Using a single tower for both recipes is a bad idea, so don't do it!%n%nPreferably, you should input Fluorine and TB Salt and let it run for a while. Speeding up the recipe by overclocking and making more towers is a good idea, since the TF4 is your bottleneck now. Alongside it, you get several fluorides: Lithium, Neptunium, Technetium and Selenium. These might prove useful in the future, but your goal is the Thorium one.

# Quest: Naquadah Reactor For Nuclear Fuels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfA.name=Naquadah Reactor For Nuclear Fuels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfA.desc=What is the most powerful nuclear fission generator there is? The answer to that question isn't even a nuclear fission generator, for the most part. The answer is the Large Naquadah Generator. It follows the same principle as the LFTR, use a new processing chain to turn Thorium, Uranium and Plutonium into liquid fuels, very dense with energy, which are then slowly burned to generate large amounts of power over a very long period of time. This reactor, for example, burns its fuels 1 milibucket at a time, over several seconds, when running without additives, a very slow burner by default.%n%nLet's look at the NEI recipes. Excited Thorium outputs 2,200 EU/t, Excited Uranium outputs 12,960 EU/t and Excited Plutonium outputs 32,400 EU/t. These are small numbers, clearly, so this can't possibly be the most powerful nuclear fission reactor. However, this multi is more complicated than that! In total, there are 4 inputs you can provide for it: one of them is the required fuel and another is the also required Liquid Air to generate EU from that fuel, but the other 2 are additives that are optional, yet increase both the efficiency and the consumption speed of the fuel. The controller's tooltip lists all the possible additives and their bonuses.%n%nFuel efficiency here means that the fuel is burned at the same rate, but energy output is increased by the percentage. Let's consider the two best options, Cryotheum and Atomic Separation Catalyst. They multiply with each other, so the energy output is 2.75 x 16 = 44 times the displayed EU/t on NEI! Excited Plutonium, the most energetic of the three fuels, will award you with 1,425,600 EU/t, almost 3 UV amps.

# Quest: Maxed-out LFTR
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfQ.name=Maxed-out LFTR
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfQ.desc=An LuV LFTR running on Fuel 3 outputs 4 ZPM amps per tick, or 524,288 EU/t. Each bucket is worth 1,048,576,000,000 EU, more than a trillion EU! Certainly, this is the most power-dense fuel you've ever held, and now that you've made it here, you can make it to fusion and beyond much more easily. But wait, there's more!%n%nYou might have noticed that the limiting factor in using the best recipe for Fuel 1 and Fuel 2 was the U Salt, which ultimately makes the LFTR Fuel Base. You just can't get enough of it to drop that inefficient 4-input recipe. However, the increased output of U Salt from Fuel 3, alongside the doubling that you can get from processing Helium Sparged U Salt instead of the regular one, means that you can use the 2-input recipe to make all your fuel from now on! If you haven't set up Helium Sparge Towers yet, do so now.%n%nWhen you do this, you can grab the two Fuel Refineries you should have and set them both to the 2-input recipe. Each bucket of Fuel 3 takes 9000 seconds to make, but is consumed in 4000 seconds, so it's good to have more than one Refinery per LFTR. With this, you will make fuel much faster, and generate much more EU than before. If you continue expanding, it's very possible to match the first tiers of fusion power from something like this.

# Quest: Radioactivity's Additives
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfg.name=Radioactivity's Additives
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfg.desc=The Naquadah Reactor has the potential to be an endgame power generator, but only if the right additives are used. These additives boost the EU/t output of the multi, but in different ways, and it's important to upgrade them as quickly as possible. However, going beyond the max output of the Dynamo Hatch is not a good idea!%n%nThere are two types of additives: the coolants and the fuel boosters. The coolants boost fuel efficiency, which means fuel consumption is the same, whereas the boosters increase the speed the multi burns the fuel, increasing the output at the same time.%n%nThere are three coolants, but the 275%% efficiency boost by using Cryotheum should not be ignored. To automate it, you will need an automated source of Blaze Rods and Snowballs (Snow is made from Water). To this, you add Redstone and Saltpeter, and you're done.%n%nThe boosters are more difficult to choose from. Caesium should be ignored, Uranium 235 can be automated from Uranium 238 with magic at an almost 1:1 ratio, but Naquadah is what you probably have ready to use for this, which quadruples the speed of this reactor. However, if this is too slow, you can instead automate Atomic Separation Catalyst to get a 16x speed boost! There are many recipes for this, so choose your favorite.

# Quest: Automation for Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfw.name=Automation for Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfw.desc=If you've looked at the wiki setups, you might have seen some that seem harder to automate than others. Particularly, that one with two kinds of Uranium Rods. More than filling empty slots with Reactor Platings to force all the inputs to move to the specific slots where the rods must go, this one needs each rod to go in a specific slot!%n%nThe solution for this is a GT cover. The Robot Arm does the same action of moving items around as the Conveyor, but it moves to specific slots. With this, you can move the Dual Rod to where it needs to be, and the Quad Rods can fill the remaining slots as intended. If you're using other setups, you can use a similar logic to do your automation.

# Quest: EV vs. IV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgA.name=EV vs. IV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgA.desc=Your sourcing of Uranium is gonna be very small in EV, unless you use crops. Similarly, your ability to put together the multiblocks needed for the fluid nuke will be better in IV, since you can mine Small Titanium Ore directly, and use GT++ multis.%n%nAll in all, the Tier 2 Rocket makes things a lot easier by letting you mine ores on Mars and Phobos to get Uranium and Tungstate/Scheelite. However, building it requires considerable progression in EV, due to TPV Coils, which need Titanium and Platinum, and the Mainframes that the rocket needs. In IV, fluid nukes are one of the best choices for efficient power without a lot of setup, although it's very viable to use Thorium and not just Uranium, so you can ignore Uranium Fuel Rods and use fluid nukes in EV if you so wish.%n%nEither way, it's recommended to have a multiblock Miner in either the Nether or Phobos, to source your Thorium or Uranium.

# Quest: Thorium vs. Uranium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgQ.name=Thorium vs. Uranium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgQ.desc=Thorium and Uranium have a lot of differences, but also a lot of similarities.%n%nIn general, Uranium is a better fuel, but fluid nukes do not follow that general rule. Because they do not output any EU/t, and simply convert heat to Hot Coolant, the difference between the two fuels becomes minimal and Thorium stands out as being much easier to get and turn into fuel rods. The maximum amount of heat you can safely move around in a reactor limits the amount of Uranium Fuel Rods you can use, which means that your HU value will not be as high as you would have wanted.%n%nFor regular and vacuum IC2 nukes, however, Uranium has a big advantage. Especially in vacuum nukes, which are the most powerful, the efficient cooling through the cells makes it so a lot of Uranium can be processed at once, which returns incredible amounts of EU/t. The different conversion from fuel to energy between fluid and vacuum means that Thorium is very good for fluid nukes, whereas Uranium is very good for vacuum nukes.

# Quest: Max Danger Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgg.name=Max Danger Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgg.desc=Were you courageous enough to build a vac nuke? If so, are you courageous enough to do it in a MOX setup, with high heat?%n%nYes, this is possible, and extremely powerful. However, all the risks you signed up for are exponentially increased, since MOX nukes keep getting better and better the closer the nuke's temperature is to the critical point. This sort of automation is more complicated than almost any other, and I honestly don't have any specific guidelines for you.%n%nIf you manage this, do share it on the Discord. I bet people will be surprised.

# Quest: Duranium and the Cyclotron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgw.name=Duranium and the Cyclotron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgw.desc=In the previous quest, Duranium was introduced as a material used to make Tritanium. While it becomes required for this reason, there is more to it than that. Another recipe that uses it is a Cyclotron recipe, which has a chance to produce a Quantum Anomaly.%n%nFirst off, what is the Cyclotron? That is a multiblock that works a bit like fusion, but only for the purpose of making new materials. It collides single particles with one another, or against fluids, to generate new items while consuming power. Most of the recipes it has won't be very useful, if at all, but it can also make Quantum Anomalies. This is a chance craft, but the Anomaly has a special property: when used to convert some blocks to others, it will not be consumed. Therefore, for that purpose, you only need to get one.%n%nIs this required? Well, yes. When you arrive at a certain stage of the game, you might find yourself needing a new kind of soldering alloy, called Mutated Living Solder. To craft this, you need a Chemical Plant made with Botmium, which is an alloy that required Advanced Nitinol. This, in turn, is one of the blocks that need a Quantum Anomaly for its conversion. Given that Duranium is the only fluid choice to make the Anomaly, then it becomes required for this as well, but only a couple tiers from ZPM.%n%nAdditionally, there are other recipes, like the Elemental Duplicator. This is a very powerful replicator that will give you a great boost in automation due to its speed and the replication recipes it can do, but the Quantum Anomaly used in this recipe will be consumed, so watch out: if you only have one, don't use it for this. Later on, however, you will encounter other recipes that consume the anomaly, namely the casings for the Quantum Force Transformer, so it will be important to automate their production by then.

# Quest: The End of Fusion Materials
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhA.name=The End of Fusion Materials
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhA.desc=There are only so many required fusion materials, which you've already gone through at this point. There are many more recipes, many of which have been listed in the quests so far, but also some that are yet to be tackled.%n%nThis, however, is the endgame. If you look at NEI, there are some recipes with EU/T and start EU values that are higher than what t3 fusion can offer, which suggests that there is yet another tier. The reality is that t4 fusion does exist, but it's more for bragging rights than real usefulness, alongside being much more expensive and harder to make than any of the other reactors. There is a quest for this in the "Endgame Goals" page, should you have unlocked that.%n%nAmong the last materials, you will find Flerovium, Rhugnor and, finally, Hypogen. They don't have a lot of possible uses for most of the pack, but Hypogen becomes essential in the endgame, where it becomes part of the coil block progression, as well as being used in some recipes as wires. If you truly want to walk towards the stargate, you will need to craft many stacks of this.

# Quest: Reactors are Expensive!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhQ.name=Reactors are Expensive!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhQ.desc=Your first t1 Fusion Reactor is one of the biggest walls to overcome throughout this pack's progression. It's very unlikely you can afford to just build another one right after, so you will have to manage several reactions with that single one.%n%nThe new fusion condition is that you will have to pay a cost of EU and time every time you switch the recipe that's being crafted. Assuming you're using fusion power, the production of Europium and any other material should be batched between your usual rows of power generation. Perhaps you're overproducing power? In that case, you can use the pause to fuse some useful materials.%n%nIn time, you will be able to afford and use multiple fusion reactors. For now, this isn't the case.

# Quest: Establishment of Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhg.name=Establishment of Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhg.desc=Fusion is the lategame. It is not the entire lategame, but several tiers are effectively relying on it, even if new ways of generating power are being discovered (developed) over time. Whether you got here through focusing on power or products, you have surely felt the importance of that donut on your base, have you not? Let's just hope your power storage doesn't run out when you start relying on Mega Blast Furnace processing.%n%nIf you've looked at NEI enough, you might have discovered Force Plasma, or some of its crafting steps. This plasma is the end of the first of three fusion chains dedicated to power generation, although some of these special plasmas transform into useful materials in Plasma Turbines or Extreme Heat Exchangers, like Celestial Tungsten later on. There are three of these chains, and the build on top of one another: one for MK1 Reactors, another for MK2 and the last for MK3.%n%nYou can build these chains any time you like, and they offer more EU/t per Fusion Reactor than the Helium Plasma alternative, but it's unlikely you'll need them this early. They only become really useful later on, at the MK3 stage with bigger reactors and turbines. Despite the fact the three plasmas can be used for power, only the final one, Celestial Tungsten, is powerful enough to be worthwhile for your central power generation.

# Quest: A Second Reactor?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhw.name=A Second Reactor?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhw.desc=At this point, why not? You should be in a better position to afford it, but there is the issue that t3 fusion unlocks an easier Americium recipe, which lets you craft a second t3 more easily. You might not want to wait that long, maybe you've been smelting a lot of ingots, or using World Accelerators?%n%nRegardless, two Helium Plasma reactors will surely suffice for whatever it is you're doing. Tin Plasma is worth using, of course, but the Molecular Transformer recipe to convert Silver to Tin isn't available in the singleblock anymore, so you might want the easier option, since you're rocking two reactors and all. With the 2x overclock they're still produce millions of EU/t with the right Plasma Turbines, assuming you have them ready.%n%nIf you want to continue expanding, you can look at the Mk2 fusion chain that ends at Runite Plasma. This process uses Force Plasma from the Mk1 fusion chain, so it needs those 5 fusion recipes, plus another 5. Despite being an extremely powerful powergen option, it's unlikely you need something in this scale right now. Keep in mind, however, that you might need it in UHV or UEV.

Second, you're going to need to be in ZPM to make the casings you need, full stop. You need a ZPM ABS for the components, so come back once you've made a ZPM Energy Hatch.%n%nYou can probably figure most of it out on your own, but keep in mind that some of the materials need to be created in the ABS, solidified, macerated, and then used in another ABS recipe. The examples here are Hastelloy-N for Lafium Compound and, Rhenium for Laurenium. Rhenium itself is made with a nonstandard ABS recipe. You also need Dysprosium which requires either making Rare Earth (III) or going to the Toxic Everglades. And either Rare Earth (II) or Rare Earth (III) for Ytterbium unless, again, you visit the Everglades for it. [warn]The Everglades ore veins might be very hard to find, due to their rarity.[/warn] You could also get Ytterbium from Almandine Ore if you are willing to try GT++ Milling and Froth Flotation.%n%nHave fun with that!%n%n[note]You'll almost certainly need more than this, but the exact amount, as always, depends on your hatches and buses.[/note]

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL3Q.name=Space Pumping
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL3Q.desc=At some point you may have wondered: There are these enormous gas planets in the solar system - could there be a way to "harvest" them? Indeed there is. By constructing the "Planetary Gas Siphon" multiblock, you are able to pump from the infinite supply of gas found on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. You just need to build a space station around a gas planet to get close enough to reach the gas without falling into it.%n%nDifferent gases can be extracted by pumping at different depths which is controlled by a Programmed Circuit. You need to supply (64 * depth) Mining Pipes to reach the selected depth.%n%nWhile operational, the multiblock needs d*4^(T+2) EU/t where T is the tier of the space station and d is the depth.%n%nYou can find an overview of what you can pump and where in the Tips and Tricks chapter.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEA.desc=If you want to load and unload a lot of different items from your cargo manager the pipes can get quite messy. The external distributor is a block you can place next to your cargo manager and it will help you to access different slots which you can specify in its GUI. Quite handy for pumping items in and out!

# Quest: Advanced Detector Rail
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEQ.name=Advanced Detector Rail
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEQ.desc=Now that you have a cargo manager you need a specific rail so that your cart can interact with it. Just place it next to the cargo manager, depending on the color of the side it is on you will have to adjust settings in the cargo manager GUI.

# Quest: Let's Get Some Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGVw.name=Let's Get Some Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGVw.desc=First we're gonna need some pipes to connect everything. Do not use these pipes in junctions or the items will choose which path to go at random and you don't want that.%n%n[note]Keep in mind PR automation is laggy, so don't use it more than the minimum you can get away with on servers, wait until AE2 for that. In SP, do what you want, but keep in mind that AE2 is way more powerful.[/note]

# Quest: Junctions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWA.name=Junctions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWA.desc=So how do we deal with junctions then? We use these pipes. They are smart and they will send everything where it needs to go, so if you make a junction make sure you put this pipe there.

# Quest: Interacting With Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWQ.name=Interacting With Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWQ.desc=That's all nice and all, but none of these pipes connect to chests and machines. What am I supposed to do with them?%n%nI'm glad you asked. You are going to need a special pipe for that. This is a pipe you need to use to connect to machines and chests. You'll have to set it up with chips that we'll make soon.

# Quest: Chips
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWg.name=Chips
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWg.desc=Now you need to make some chips to use in those interface pipes. These are useless on their own but essential for crafting the others.%n%nNow would be a good time to look into IC2 crops to get all the dyes you will need for your advanced chips.%n%n[note]If NEI's bookmarks are blocking you on the left, you can turn it off (O) until that gets fixed.[/note]

# Quest: Item Responder Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWw.name=Item Responder Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWw.desc=This chip also stores items in connected inventory. It designates a storage for items that are set in the filter of this chip. They do not actively request for items, they only serve as a destination for items to go. You can open up the menu by right-clicking the chip. There you can set which items should it accept and the priority. Items will go to item responders with higher priority first.

# Quest: Item Overflow Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXA.name=Item Overflow Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXA.desc=This chip stores the items in a connected inventory. It designates a storage for items that have no other place to go. It is strongly recommended to have a default storage for items in every pipe system, otherwise bad stuff can happen. Best used with a large chest (diamond for example).%n%nIt seems to have some bugs though, so don't craft more than one without testing it first.%n%nYou might have to just use a normal item responder and add the items you want routed back to your overflow spot.

# Quest: Dynamic Item Responder
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXQ.name=Dynamic Item Responder
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXQ.desc=The dynamic item responder chip behaves exactly like an item responder chip, but instead of you setting up which items it should accept, it looks in the chest what items are there and those items it will accept.

# Quest: Item Extractor Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXg.name=Item Extractor Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXg.desc=This chip will extract items from the connecting inventory. The extracted items then look for pipes with item responder chips where there's a free space they could go. If they don't find any they will go to the overflow default storage chest.%n%nIf you want it to extract everything leave the filter empty and set it to blacklist.

# Quest: Item Broadcaster
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXw.name=Item Broadcaster
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXw.desc=The item broadcaster is a chip that tells everything in the pipe system what items it has in the connecting inventory and if another chip needs anything it will send it to them. Right-click it to set the items it will transmit. If you leave it empty and set to blacklist it will transmit everything.%n%nDefinitely use one in combination with an item overflow chip on your default storage chest. That way overflow will end up in the chest, but will be usable by the rest of your system.

# Quest: Item Stock Keeper Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYA.name=Item Stock Keeper Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYA.desc=The item stock keeper looks at the connecting inventory and keeps item stocked in there. If the item is missing it will keep bothering item broadcasters every few seconds if they have the item and if they can send it. It's basically like an annoying child.%n%nIt is really useful though. Want a chest that will always have 64 cobble and dirt in it and if you take them they will get replaced? This guy is perfect for that job. It's great for keeping machines stocked. When stocking GT machines, the top left slot of the 3x3 is equal to the left slot of the machine. Want a chemical reactor that keeps 3 hydrogen cells ready to go to make ammonia, just add nitrogen? This is the chip for you.

# Quest: Crafting Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYQ.name=Crafting Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYQ.desc=The crafting chip does exactly what it says. It's not just for default crafting. You can use it with GT machines. Just put in the matrix that it should insert and the output is what it should extract. A great use for them is in combination with fluid canners or super tanks for filling cells.%n%n%n[note]While these chips are really powerful for your PRT system they become a laghazard relatively quickly, so be careful.[/note]

# Quest: Request Pipe
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYg.name=Request Pipe
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYg.desc=This pipe lets you request stuff from the system. It shows all items that are available thanks to broadcast chips and even stuff that can be crafted thanks to crafting chips.

# Quest: Simple Storage System
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYw.name=Simple Storage System
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYw.desc=[warn]Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will tank TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.[/warn]%n%nTime to build a simple system to store your stuff. Place down the drawer controller and place the drawers around it. Connect the interface pipe to the drawer controller and put the dynamic item responder and broadcaster chips inside. Don't forget to set the broadcaster to transmit everything by leaving the filter empty and setting it to blacklist. Now you can request stuff from your storage and if you have a chest with a pipe and extractor chip everything you put inside will be sorted into the storage.

# Quest: Desulfurizing Oil Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGZA.name=Desulfurizing Oil Automation

# Quest: Electrolyzing Water
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGZg.name=Electrolyzing Water
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGZg.desc=Now let's automate electrolyzing water into oxygen and hydrogen. You'll need hydrogen for tons of stuff including desulfurization, obtaining tungsten, and nitric acid production. Oxygen is also useful as I'm sure you noticed when making steel.%n%nHow to set it up:%n%nPlace the electrolyzer down and connect it to water and electricity. Place the 2 super tanks nearby. Set the electrolyzer to produce hydrogen gas and oxygen cells. Use normal GT fluid pipes to output the hydrogen gas into one super tank. That is now your hydrogen storage. Now connect interface pipes to all 3 machines.%n%nFor the electrolyzer put in item stock keeper set to keep 2 empty cells stored. Also put in extractor set to extract oxygen cells.%n%nNow for the oxygen storage put it item responder chip set to accept oxygen cells and extractor set to extract empty cells.%n%nNow put some empty cells inside your default storage chest and don't forget to have a broadcaster there.

# Quest: Desulfurizing the Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGZw.name=Desulfurizing the Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGZw.desc=Now it's time to start the actual desulfurization. Use a chemical reactor of your choice, fill it with sulfuric light fuel and hook it to power. Now connect an interface pipe to it. Put an item stock keeper inside set to store 4 hydrogen cells. Then put in item extractor set to extract hydrogen sulfide and empty cells.%n%nGo to your hydrogen storage super tank and put in a crafting chip set to make one hydrogen cell from one empty cell.%n%nAnd that's all.

# Quest: Dealing with H2S
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGaA.name=Dealing with H2S
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGaA.desc=Now let's convert all that H2S into sulfuric acid. Hook up a chemical reactor to electricity, water and interface pipe. Put inside an item responder chip set to accept H2S cells and extract empty cells. Distill that diluted sulfuric acid in distillery and store it in super tank.%n%nCongratulations. You now have a completely automatic desulfuring of oil, automatic production of hydrogen and oxygen and you also store all that sulfuric acid.

# Quest: Small Reward
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGaQ.name=Small Reward
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGaQ.desc=Here's a small reward for making all those chips.

# Quest: Reward for Desulfurizing Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGag.name=Reward for Desulfurizing Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGag.desc=The greatest reward is having your stuff automated if you've done everything correctly, but here's a reward for making it this far.%n%nSome other setups to look at automating are making polyethylene and nitric acid.%n%nWith stock keeper chips you can always keep a set amount on-hand and when you pull out the cells to use elsewhere, your setup will automatically make more.

# Quest: Does Anyone Even Still Use These?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKng.name=Does Anyone Even Still Use These?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKng.desc=If you do, they're now really good. I guess. They sound like it at least?

# Quest: Hello World!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG4Q.name=Hello World!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG4Q.desc=First things first, let's install OpenOS to the computer so you don't always need disk in the drive. Type in 'install' and then type 'Y' when asked if you wish to install OpenOS.%n%nWhen finished, remove the disk and toss it on your wall and reboot the computer.%n%nType 'df' to display all present file systems and mount points, you'll notice one named OpenOS; this is your hard drive's default name after installing the OS.%n%nLet's change it with 'label -a OpenOS HDD', '-a' checks for names starting with what you type after it with that command. [note]<-- part of this is apparently wrong? Thanks for the non-ticket explaining what part, guys.[/note]%n%nNow for fun, let's make your first program! How about something functional, make a with 'edit startup' this will bring you to an edit page for a new program called startup. Let's just have it do something simple, 'print("Hello World!")' Like that'll never get old.%n%nNow press Ctrl+S to save, and Ctrl+W to get out of that screen. Back in your home root let's now type startup and you'll see it display "Hello World!" neat huh?%n%nLet's now make startup actually work on startup. Type 'edit .shrc' .shrc is a mystic file that runs shell commands when booting your PC. So in .shrc type 'startup' save and reboot the computer. Now it should say "Hello World!" upon starting. Double neat right?

# Quest: I Love Pressing the F5 Key.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG4g.name=I Love Pressing the F5 Key.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG4g.desc=It's so refreshing.%n%nPlace a keyboard facing a screen, or stuck to the back of a screen to make it able to interact with a computer.%n%nAbsolutely necessary to doing anything on your computer, but can safely be removed once you have an endlessly running program.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG4w.desc=Alright, you have your computer, it says "Hello World!" When you start it, and you feel awesome and capable of world domination.%n%nNow let's set up your HDD. Open .shrc again in the editor, and press ENTER to go down a line after the print, and type in 'cd ../' this will move your viewed directory that's being viewed to the absolute base directory.%n%nNow go down another line and type in 'mount HDD C:' because why not, it's Classic; this mounts the file drive into the folder you're in. Go down another line and type cd 'C:/' save and reboot the computer.%n%nYou'll now start in C:/ nifty! Try typing 'mkdir programs' and now you have a dedicated directory to put your programs in for the sake of organization.%n'cd programs' will then take you to programs, and 'cd ../' will take you back a directory; you can also do things like, let's say you have a folder called apples in C as well but you're in apples, type 'cd ../apples' and it'll take you to apples. '..' essentially just means previous directory and this can be stacked; works with copying files and moving them as well, very useful to know.%n%nBut right now we're going to do something functional, come over to the next quest and bring your adapter and cables.

# Quest: Basic Power Display
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG5A.name=Basic Power Display
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG5A.desc=For this part we will learn how to use our adapter, place it next to, let's say your EBFs battery buffer and connect it to the computer with cables.%nNow let's type in lua while on the computer to open the LUA environment where we can test things without worrying about saving and trying our program.%n%nType in 'component.list()' this will display a table of all of .list from component. What we're looking for is gt_batterybuffer.%nIf you have too many nearby things it may not display and the way to search the entire list of components is too advanced for starters.%n%nSo now assign a variable to it; for example 'a = component.gt_batterybuffer'; now we can call 'a' to see what methods the batteryBuffer has.%nWhat we'll be using in this example is the 'getBatteryCharge' method. So type  'a.getBatteryCharge(1)' this will call the method getBatteryCharge from the first inventory slot on the gt_batterybuffer in component.%n%nSo if we're using a 2x2 battery buffer; we can type something like, 'for i=1, 4 do print(a.getBatteryCharge(i)) end'%nPoof you now see what all the batteries EU values. Now what can we do with this?%n%nTry making a variable called 'batteryCharge = 0', now do 'for i=1, 4 do batteryCharge = batteryCharge + a.getBatteryCharge(i) end'%n%nNow print(batteryCharge) will display the total charge. Here's a program example of this being used.%n%nPlace in your tape drive and type 'install', and follow the prompts to install it into C. Then edit it, test it, figure how it works.%n%nI suppose that's enough for now; congrats! Experiment and learn, and don't forget to check google as much as possible!%nThis questline will be updated again in the future; but I figure this is a good ending point for now.

# Quest: Naming Names
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHxw.name=Naming Names
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHxw.desc=The Factory Labeler allows you to assign unique names to anything that can be connected to a Manager - making it easy to identify when you are setting up commands.%n%nType in the text box to set a label or to searched stored labels - click any stored entry to select it, double-click to edit it. Closing the GUI will set the Labeler to whatever was in the text box at that time.%n%nLeft-click to set labels, right-click to open the gui. Setting a blank label will remove any existing labels.%n%n[note]May or may not be buggy. Will lose the label in MP when relogging, but works fine in SP. It'll still work until you need to change it though. Have fun![/note]

# Quest: Redstone Emitter

# Quest: Upgrades
betterquesting.quest.3wK8pIDKSOii1__bwf6Ycw.name=Upgrades
betterquesting.quest.3wK8pIDKSOii1__bwf6Ycw.desc=You want to automate recipes involving fluids, but the crafting module only accept items? You want to see how machines are handling recipes in the request table to see if something gets stuck? You will need §lupgrades§r.%n%nYou can apply upgrades to pipes and modules, but you can't just access the upgrade menu by right-clicking the chassis with a wrench.%n%nIntroducing the Logistics Pipe Controller. This item is like a wrench for LP, except it will open the upgrades menu. It can also allow you to view statistics related to the pipe you are accessing.

# Quest: Filtering by Type
betterquesting.quest.5rc45iPDSmqLbuvcioFDEQ.name=Filtering by Type
betterquesting.quest.5rc45iPDSmqLbuvcioFDEQ.desc=There are situations where there are a large amount of the same type of items, but the quantity of each aren't large enough to get them dedicated storage...%n%nThe Type Filter ItemSink Module can assign an item type to inventory space it is connected to. All items of the same type will be assigned to that inventory space.

# Quest: Fluid Storage
betterquesting.quest.7O4n10fJSxme0Bs0_n44xg.name=Fluid Storage
betterquesting.quest.7O4n10fJSxme0Bs0_n44xg.desc=Logistics Pipes can handle fluids.%n%nThere are multiple pipes for fluids in logistics pipes. Logistics Fluid Basic Pipe will be the one you will be mainly using.%n%nYou can attach it to a tank, assign a fluid to it, and it will assign the buffer tank for that fluid. Basically a fluid version of the ItemSink.

# Quest: Pls Provide
betterquesting.quest.7_AtC62nTAKG1nTYoyS-8g.name=Pls Provide
betterquesting.quest.7_AtC62nTAKG1nTYoyS-8g.desc=Just like items which have itemsink modules for storage and provider modules for request, fluids have basically the equivalent pipes.%n%nThe Logistics Fluid Provider Pipe will do the job. It will provide the fluid to other pipes and machines connected to them that need the fluid.

# Quest: Crafting on Demand
betterquesting.quest.8CwALDydSAaz9GGQm5tB-g.name=Crafting on Demand
betterquesting.quest.8CwALDydSAaz9GGQm5tB-g.desc=We can now request items, but it sucks when the systems lack the component while we CAN craft those components.%n%nThe system needs to know how to craft the items it is requesting.%n%nTo get started, get a crafting module. Both automation of machine-crafted recipes and crafting table recipes need this module, in one way or another.

# Quest: Chassis
betterquesting.quest.9OtAPqTQQBaCixJITgpnFg.name=Chassis
betterquesting.quest.9OtAPqTQQBaCixJITgpnFg.desc=Basic Pipes can interact with adjacent blocks, but they also don't do much on their own.%n%nLogistics Pipes has modules that provide the pipes with more complex functions, but the Basic Logistics Pipes can't make use of them.%n%nTo make use of the modules, there are special pipes called Chassis.%n%nThere are multiple tiers of Chassis in Logistics Pipes. For now, a Mk 1, which can hold 1 module, will work.%n%nYou can insert modules directly in the chassis by right-clicking said chassis with the module. But if you need to take modules out of a chassis or configure a module in one, you need to right-click the chassis with a wrench to access its UI.

# Quest: Troubleshooting...
betterquesting.quest.EfJnTMxuTMKc5VhvNOxrYQ.name=Troubleshooting...
betterquesting.quest.EfJnTMxuTMKc5VhvNOxrYQ.desc=If you find your pipe has thick red corners, then it means something is wrong. Either the network is out of power or you formed a junction with an Unrouted Transport Pipe.%n%nWhen the system gets more complicated, the chances go up that something will go wrong. Have fun troubleshooting! :)

# Quest: Better Chassis
betterquesting.quest.FFDyUcsHTpiFg7_Yjr8vGA.name=Better Chassis
betterquesting.quest.FFDyUcsHTpiFg7_Yjr8vGA.desc=Now that storage is handled, you want to dive into the automation part?%n%nA Mk1 Chassis can't hold enough modules for complex functions. We need a better one.%n%nChassis Mk2 can hold 2 modules. It should do for now.

# Quest: Requestin' a Recipe
betterquesting.quest.FYOm8b1PRTKsyVjFdpBqjg.name=Requestin' a Recipe
betterquesting.quest.FYOm8b1PRTKsyVjFdpBqjg.desc=Most of the time you are requesting things because you need to craft something. So here is the Logistics Request Table.%n%nThis thing comes with a 3*3 crafting grid that you can load with a NEI recipe and request the recipe. There is also an inventory buffer that you can use to store items within.

# Quest: Sorting Incoming
betterquesting.quest.FkDubMYaQ5GKGvvfHZ73yw.name=Sorting Incoming
betterquesting.quest.FkDubMYaQ5GKGvvfHZ73yw.desc=Now that storage spaces are organized and assigned, time to let the network sort the items for us.%n%nThere are 2 ways to insert items into the system%n%n1. Use an extraction module to extract items into the system. It is slow, but everything that has a valid destination will be sent into the network.%n%n2. Use a QuickSort module. It extracts a whole stack of items that has a valid destination. This module will ignore items that have no destinations other than the default route though...%n%nIt is your choice. Pick what you like.

# Quest: More ItemSinks in NEI
betterquesting.quest.HA1vu57XQG-Na7rAPEFSDA.name=More ItemSinks in NEI
betterquesting.quest.HA1vu57XQG-Na7rAPEFSDA.desc=There are more kinds of ItemSink modules in NEI. Feel free to look through them to find the ItemSink module that suits your needs.%n%nHow they sort items and assign inventory spaces are mostly explained by their item names.

# Quest: The Basic Pipe
betterquesting.quest.HpeL1-zMRnKpYxYmLHqHaw.name=The Basic Pipe
betterquesting.quest.HpeL1-zMRnKpYxYmLHqHaw.desc=Unrouted Transport Pipes by themselves aren't useful.%n%nTime to use some of them to craft some Basic Logistics Pipes.%n%nThe Basic Logistics Pipes can connect to adjacent inventories and blocks. They also have item routing capabilities, so you can use them to form junctions.%n%nBut they also cost some diamonds...

# Quest: The Backbone of the System
betterquesting.quest.Ig-vbx9-R2alDVAybPGzLA.name=The Backbone of the System
betterquesting.quest.Ig-vbx9-R2alDVAybPGzLA.desc=Welcome to Logistics Pipes! This questline is dedicated to this automation mod, which is placed in the MV tier to help manage your chests, crafting and even fluid crafting. It's quite similar to ProjectRed: Transportation, but with some differences, particularly in fluid crafting.%n%nHere, you can connect chests and machines to a central location, but before you build that central location, you have to get some pipes for connection. The Unrouted Transport Pipe is the first pipe you will ever need in Logistics Pipes.%n%nThey only connect to other pipes and don't have any item routing capabilities, but you will need a ton of them.%n%n§cWarning: Do NOT form junctions with the Unrouted Transport Pipes. Items going into an unrouted transport pipe junction will come out of a random exit of the junction.

# Quest: There Is Extra Stuff...
betterquesting.quest.Ix6qrScZQPGnl3jEm9P2Ag.name=There Is Extra Stuff...
betterquesting.quest.Ix6qrScZQPGnl3jEm9P2Ag.desc=Sometimes, a recipe has some extra outputs but the crafting module only has 1 output slot.%n%nThat is where the Crafting Byproduct Extraction Upgrade comes in. You can assign a byproduct of the recipe and this upgrade will make the module extract the byproduct as well. Now they won't clog the output buffer.

# Quest: Remote requests
betterquesting.quest.MwRByyNxQt-LfGgUqm8QDQ.name=Remote requests
betterquesting.quest.MwRByyNxQt-LfGgUqm8QDQ.desc=Remote requests aren't always convenient. As long as you are in range with a request pipe, the remote orderer can take the order and send it to a request pipe the orderer binds to.%n%nPretty handy if you have an ender chest and an ender pouch...%n%n[note]Author's note: Too bad ender chests and pouches are gated behind IV and thaumcraft... And why people would use an LP system at that point is really beyond me...[/note]

# Quest: Get Those Machines to Work
betterquesting.quest.N8isBrjBRNe-3f-IHVymDg.name=Get Those Machines to Work
betterquesting.quest.N8isBrjBRNe-3f-IHVymDg.desc=Most of the recipes are made in all kinds of machines. While a crafting logistics pipe works, it can only hold 1 recipe per pipe.%n%nIt is not an issue for logistics crafting tables as it can only hold one crafting table recipes, but it is wasteful to assign only one recipe for one machine.%n%nFor machines, use chassis. Preferably a higher tier. A Mk1 chassis with a crafting module is basically just a crafting logistics pipe.%n%nYou can't shift-click recipes from NEI so you have to drag the recipe from it. Don't worry, you can drag ghost items from NEI into the slots in the module to configure it.%n%nYou notice there are 3 grey slots at the right. They are for satellite logistics pipes. We will talk about it later.%n%n§cNote: do NOT use the output face of the machine. The output side blocks all interactions unless you hit it with a screwdriver.%n%nAlso do NOT use auto-output, or else the machine will output the item into the pipe and the network will treat the product as an item inserted into the system rather than an item requested by the system and will send it to its storage. Every other face except the cover works.§r%n%nThe checkmark means you have read the whole thing and should know how machine automation works using LP. The reward of this quest is the knowledge of how to automate GT machine recipes

# Quest: Let this Sink in
betterquesting.quest.TBZf_HtQTQ-yckug0fs8kA.name=Let this Sink in
betterquesting.quest.TBZf_HtQTQ-yckug0fs8kA.desc=A well organized storage system is crucial for a logistics system.%n%nWith the ability to use modules through a chassis, we can now prepare for storage modules.%n%nLogistics Pipes uses ItemSink modules to assign storage spaces.%n%nThis ItemSink modules can be used in 2 ways:%n%n1. Assign the storage of a connected inventory with at most 9 different kinds of items by setting 9 items as filter on the module.%n%n2. Assign a connected inventory as a default route. The default route is a destination for items that have no other valid storage spaces.%n%n§cNote: remember to always check if the default route has additional spaces because items that are stuck in the pipes without a destination will eventually YEET themselves out of the pipes.

# Quest: Time to Request
betterquesting.quest.VH7nGtkWRp-riK1I3cq5yw.name=Time to Request
betterquesting.quest.VH7nGtkWRp-riK1I3cq5yw.desc=Your system now has the capability of providing items for requests, time to request items.%n%nThis Request Logistics Pipe can send out requests that, if the network has items that can fulfill the requests, send the item to the pipe.%n%nAttach an inventory to it so that when items reach the request logistics pipe, they are stored in an inventory and don't get yeeted out.

# Quest: Time to See The Process
betterquesting.quest.VISeokU3R-efeF88FwLGLw.name=Time to See The Process
betterquesting.quest.VISeokU3R-efeF88FwLGLw.desc=Want to see how the system is handling the request and fix it when you find things get stuck? Here is the upgrade for you.%n%nThe Crafting Monitoring Upgrade can let you view the current progress of the request. So if you find your crafting request is taking an abnormally long time and nothing is crafted by your machines, you may want to take a look here.%n%nIt can be applied to your Logistics Request Table.

# Quest: EVEN EVEN BETTER CHASSIS
betterquesting.quest.Va3q2ob4Q-6sSdIxiIfuJw.name=EVEN EVEN BETTER CHASSIS
betterquesting.quest.Va3q2ob4Q-6sSdIxiIfuJw.desc=What? You need better chassis already? Need even more recipe slots?%n%nHere is the Chassis Mk4. It holds 4 modules.

# Quest: Inserting Fluids
betterquesting.quest.WTIyEmzLR_mlw__SXY_iwA.name=Inserting Fluids
betterquesting.quest.WTIyEmzLR_mlw__SXY_iwA.desc=Sometimes you insert fluid in the system. You need something to get the fluid into the correct buffer other than inserting the fluid into the buffer manually.%n%nThere are 2 pipes that can do the job: transfer fluid into a tank connected to a fluid basic pipe allocated to said fluid.%n%n1. Logistics Fluid Extractor Pipe. It extracts fluid from connected buffer to the correct big storage tank. It doesn't require a pump but it is slower.%n%n2. Logistics Fluid Insertion Pipe. It does not pull fluids from tanks actively, requiring a GT pump if you are using GT tanks, but it can send fluids faster.%n%nTake a pick :)

# Quest: It's DA BEST
betterquesting.quest.ZS2_l5v3R2-gh69ESL-FNQ.name=It's DA BEST
betterquesting.quest.ZS2_l5v3R2-gh69ESL-FNQ.desc=You still need MORE recipe slots for the crafting modules?%n%nThis one will cost you §lTITANIUM§r. Are you sure about that?%n%nYes? OK...%n%nHere is the final tier of chassis: Chassis Mk5. Instead of incrementing the number of modules it can hold by 1 compared to the last tier, it straight up doubles the slots. Hopefully you think it is worth it.

# Quest: Preparin' for Requestin'
betterquesting.quest._XiSkFhJQ8-WjqujCxBtlw.name=Preparin' for Requestin'
betterquesting.quest._XiSkFhJQ8-WjqujCxBtlw.desc=Logistics Pipes have automation capability in place, but first, it needs to know what inventory that items inside can be used for requests.%n%nThe Provider module does this job nicely. When you open the interface of the module, there is a 3*3 grid. You can pick what items that the module can provide, or you can leave it empty as "everything in the inventory can be provided for requests".

# Quest: Even Better Chassis
betterquesting.quest.b4P0yD1LSeO7HWzj70NM8Q.name=Even Better Chassis
betterquesting.quest.b4P0yD1LSeO7HWzj70NM8Q.desc=2 Modules are still not enough? Need more recipe slots for machines?%n%nHere is the Mk3. It can hold 3 modules.

# Quest: It gets polymorphic
betterquesting.quest.bQCnuxrTTBe4ubytZPfl-g.name=It gets polymorphic
betterquesting.quest.bQCnuxrTTBe4ubytZPfl-g.desc=Sometimes people have a storage system that contains a lot of different items, or they have a large quantity of the same item.%n%nHere comes the Polymorphic ItemSink. It assigns inventory space to the kind of items already in the inventory.%n%nVery handy especially when you have a storage controller connecting to a lot of drawers.

# Quest: Powering Logistics
betterquesting.quest.dSSmDusvSVSKi41Tnw51dA.name=Powering Logistics
betterquesting.quest.dSSmDusvSVSKi41Tnw51dA.desc=Every system takes power. A Logistics Pipes network is no exception.%n%nThe Logistics Pipes system runs on an energy called LP, but there are no generators that generate LP.%n%nInstead, Logistics Pipes has a power adapter called the Logistics Power Junction that converts EU into LP. Use a Basic Logistics Pipe to connect the Power Junction to the whole network.%n%nThe Power Junction can receive power from all 6 sides while a Basic Logistics Pipe can only connect to the sides in the 4 cardinal directions.

# Quest: Modular Upgrades
betterquesting.quest.l26l6_loSeyuxQYps9XbbA.name=Modular Upgrades
betterquesting.quest.l26l6_loSeyuxQYps9XbbA.desc=Upgrades can be applied for pipes and modules, but an extra upgrade is needed if we need to apply upgrades to modules.%n%nHere is the Upgrade Module Upgrade. But regardless of how many of these you stuff into a chassis, there will always be 2 module upgrades per module.%n%n[note]Author's Note: Why is the Upgrade Module Upgrade the ONLY upgrade that has a more 3D-style texture while the other modules and upgrades are completely flat?[/note]

# Quest: Automating Crafting Table Recipes
betterquesting.quest.qp3SFb9oSXKi5Yio_VwgEw.name=Automating Crafting Table Recipes
betterquesting.quest.qp3SFb9oSXKi5Yio_VwgEw.desc=Automating crafting table recipes is a good first step to automate your processes.%n%nTo achieve this goal, get yourself a crafting logistics pipe and a logistics crafting table.%n%nYou can import a crafting table recipe into a logistics crafting table and you can click the "import" button on the crafting logistics pipes GUI that is connected to the crafting table to import the recipe into the pipe.

# Quest: I NEED THAT!!!!!!
betterquesting.quest.tT0NrRMyTqePf1jeIx7krw.name=I NEED THAT!!!!!!
betterquesting.quest.tT0NrRMyTqePf1jeIx7krw.desc=A lot of recipes take fluids. But crafting modules only have slots for items...%n%nIntroducing the Fluid Crafting Upgrade. It will allow you to allocate one kind of fluid for the craft. Drag one fluid cell containing the fluid you need into the fluid slot and set the correct amount.%n%nDon't forget to bind it to a fluid satellite pipe. The way it binds is identical to the satellite logistics pipe.

# Quest: Satellites! Wait,... They don't Orbit...
betterquesting.quest.y2mOWnXvRe2xWrdvVS297w.name=Satellites! Wait,... They don't Orbit...
betterquesting.quest.y2mOWnXvRe2xWrdvVS297w.desc=A buffer of 64 per slot is never big enough. Just look at red alloy ingot for example. It can only hold 16 recipes worth of redstone at once. You don't really want the items to just zoom around the pipes while waiting for the machine to make room... You want to have a big chest buffering items to be processed.%n%nIntroducing the Satellite Logistics Pipes. It provides additional input into the recipe incorporating it.%n%nThe pipe runs on a numerical frequency system, with the whole server sharing the number pool. This ensures that 2 separate systems can be connected to each other without conflict.%n%nYou can "connect" a crafting module with one satellite pipe by selecting the correct frequency of the satellite part. Multiple modules can connect to a single satellite pipe.%n%nSatellite pipe inputs are the 3 grey slots on the right of the 9 slots of the module. Only items in the 3 grey slots will be sent to satellite pipes.%n%n§cNote: Ensure your satellite pipe has any frequency other than 0. A satellite pipe with frequency 0 will not work.


## Quest Line: Applied Energistics
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIw.name=Applied Energistics
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIw.desc=AE2 focuses on creating a compact, easily accessible, considerably extendible storage system called an ME Network. You can use it to autocraft items as well, and if you want to finish the pack, you will.

# Quest: Cribs
betterquesting.quest.4pCol8RvR3G0pS2zVqpY1Q.name=Cribs
betterquesting.quest.4pCol8RvR3G0pS2zVqpY1Q.desc=As your researches for Applied Greg continued, you found a way to combine ME interface's pattern processing ability with input buses, §lcrafting input buses§r! Now, you can directly place patterns into input bus. However, input buses lacked sufficient item space and computational power to process items coming from your ME network. Thus, you added additional storage and circuits.%n%nYou can even place non-consumable items like lenses, molds inside!! However, consumable items won't do anything.%n%nBut, still you lack enough technology to process fluids, they are just not good for electronics.%n%nCrafting input bus is fully isolated from other buses/hatches, so you may have to change your patterns.%n%n[warn]Crafting input proxy[/warn] will let you wallshare multiblocks without actually wallsharing them. §lUV-Tier§r%n%n[warn]Crafting input buffer[/warn] will be §9§owaterproof§r. §lUIV-Tier§r

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAsg.desc=To make an AE system, you'll need all 4 patterns, collect them all! If you hit EV without getting all of them, you can also make them yourself.%n%n[note]BTW, you need a ton of Titanium to do AE2, so if you can't make it, you won't get much of anywhere.[/note]

# Quest: Gotta Find Them All
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAsw.name=Gotta Find Them All
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAsw.desc=There are a lot of meteors on the surface, but there are more underground. In order to find those, you'll want a compass. The compass will only tell you the chunk has an asteroid in it, with your ore finder wand you can get a better idea where in the chunk the meteor is hiding.%n%nFor more details on AE2, check out [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Applied_Energistics_2[/url].

# Quest: 16k Item Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtA.name=16k Item Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtA.desc=Middle tier storage cell, which can contain 16,384 bytes of storage. 16,384 bytes of storage can hold 2,032 stacks of a single item, or 1,040 stacks, while holding 63 different items. The 16k storage cell uses 128 bytes of data to store a single type.%n%nWhen placed inside a drive or chest will consume 1.5 ae/t.

# Quest: Fluix Crystals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtQ.name=Fluix Crystals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtQ.desc=Not "flux"! Even if the color is the same. You need to add redstone and nether quartz to a charged certus crystal.

# Quest: Applied Crafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtg.name=Applied Crafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtg.desc=Crafting can be a pain. So why not automate it? These can hold a single pattern each. However, if you place an ME interface against it, you can use it to craft any of the patterns in it. You can use multiple with the same MA, and given how expensive they are now, that might be a good idea. These do NOT require a channel, but do require network access.

# Quest: Getting Your First Processors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtw.name=Getting Your First Processors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtw.desc=There are 3 different ways to make AE2 processors. First, there's the AE2 Inscribers, which are slow, hold one of each item at a time, require inputs (and output) from specific directions, but can be sped up with cards. Second, there's the Advanced Inscribers, which are similar, but allow stacking, and do not require specific directions. Lastly, there's GT Assemblers (and later the multiblock) which can be very fast, but require a fluid input, and consume more power. Get 8 of each one for now.

# Quest: Cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAuA.name=Cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAuA.desc=To have access to your applied energistics network from your entire base, you'll need cables. A lot of them. For now, the basic ones will do, but eventually, you'll end up using dense cables and p2p channels. Glass and Covered cables are functionally identical, just different in looks. Each can carry 8 channels. Quartz fibers don't carry channels but can carry energy. This is useful for providing power from your main network to independent subnetworks.%n%nYou can also color your cables - cables with different colors will not connect, so those can be used to expand network capacity by running parallel cables. Only fluix colored cables connect to all other colors. Later it will probably be more efficient to use P2P channels to jam a bunch of channels into 1.%n%nAnchors are like covers, keeping things from connecting when you don't want them to.

# Quest: Basic Terminals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAuQ.name=Basic Terminals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAuQ.desc=The ME Terminal is an interface which gives you access to an ME network's networked storage. It has the ability to sort and search, as well as filter by using a view cell.%n%nThe ME Crafting Terminal is the upgraded version of the ME terminal which has an integrated crafting grid with access to an ME network's networked storage.%n%nThe ME Interface Terminal gives remote access to all interface pattern slots on your network separated by which type of machine they are on. It will show the type of machine in the terminal, however you can name the ME interface in the inscriber or an anvil to alter the name displayed in the ME interface terminal. If you use Ender Chests to send stuff elsewhere to be processed a lot, this may help with reducing confusion. You can also search for a specific device.

# Quest: Bundled AE Channels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyw.name=Bundled AE Channels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyw.desc=P2P tunnels. You'll probably want a bunch of them! They act as teleport points from one place to another for the contained information.%n%nThey can pack up to 32 channels into 1 channel and transport those to the destination P2P bus. Each P2P tunnel requires 1 free channel. P2P connections cannot be nested, but one transport cable can carry multiple P2P connections. For a normal fluix cable, that's 4 P2P connections, and 16 for dense.%n%nYou can use separate cables to connect input P2Ps to the controller and to transport from the controller to around your base, allowing for 32 output P2Ps on one dense cable. Alternatively you can use an entirely separate controller as a transport network.%n%nGenerally, you'll want to have the first point be one side of an ME Controller block (remember you can add more!), and the other where some of your machines are.%n%nA nice online guide can be found at [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Applied_Energistics_2[/url] under P2P tunnels.%n%nIf you want to use one of the P2P tunnels for something §oother§r than ME channels, use an applicable item on the center of the face of the tunnel, (for example, a GT cable for GT EU, redstone for RS signal, an RF conduit for RF, a torch for light, a bucket for fluid, a chest for items, or an OC cable for OC) and it will convert to that type, even if you pick it up. Use a fluix cable to change it back.

# Quest: Quantum Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB0g.name=Quantum Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB0g.desc=Now you §ocould§r connect Quantum Chests to your ME System with Storage Buses, and maybe you are already doing that.

# Quest: A Digital Singularity
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1A.name=A Digital Singularity
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1A.desc=What? You filled up the Quantum storage cell? I hope it was with something better than Cobblestone. Anyway, you'd better make something EVEN bigger then.%n%nHmm, adding even more storage capacity to a single cell would result in something so dense with information that it would just collapse into a singularity. So why not be smart about it? Just use an already existing singularity! Build a sturdy casing around it and add some connecting components, and you should be good. Better use an eternal singularity, though, to make sure things remain stable.%n%n[note]The Digital Singularity can store more than 4 quintillion items. If you manage to fill one up, please contact the dev team so that they can ban you for cheating... eh, I mean, congratulate you on your achievement, of course![/note]

# Quest: Insurgence
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABbQ.name=Insurgence
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABbQ.desc=Is your infusion very slow? And, alas, to resolve that you need a world accelerator. That probably causes a lot of lag.%n%nWell no longer! Try out the new Infusion Interceptor. Read more about it on the Thaumic Insurgence page in your Thaumonomicon.

# Quest: That is not storage!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABdg.name=That is not storage!

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFCg.desc=Charged certus quartz is one of the basic components for a lot of AE recipes. Just mix some certus quartz and redstone dust to get charged certus quartz dust.%n%nUse the autoclave to make crystals. Or if you have lots of sodium, you can use the chemical reactor recipe. You can also make the charger to go directly from crystal to charged crystal, but it's not very fast. The charger can connect directly to a GT cable or a fluix cable from the bottom.%n%n[note]Note that some recipes only have a chance of producing a charged crystal, which is true of many of these.[/note]

# Quest: Keeping Your Network Happy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFCw.name=Keeping Your Network Happy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFCw.desc=Helps with fluctuating power. Energy cells store up to 2,000,000 AE. They do not accept power directly but are used to buffer some power in an already existing ME network. Energy Cells do not use a channel.

# Quest: Storing Your ME Data
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFDA.name=Storing Your ME Data
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFDA.desc=A block designed to do one thing, store storage cells. This block holds 10 storage cells so you can tightly pack your storage into a very small space. ME drives show their contents and the storage cell status on the front of the drive face.%n%nRed - Indicates the storage cell is full.%nOrange - Indicates the storage cell cannot hold any more types, but it can store more items.%nGreen - Indicates the cell can hold more types, or more items.%nBlack - Indicates there is no channel, or power is offline.%n%nIt's important to note, that without an ME Network this block does nothing. It's only useful when combined with a way to input, and output items, and requires 2 AE/t power to function, and additional power for each storage cell stored inside it.%n%nAbout Priority: Many devices in AE2 have a priority setting, this determines what gets items first. This is useful in some situations, but not so much in others. Higher number = higher priority.

# Quest: Speeding Up Growth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFDg.name=Speeding Up Growth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFDg.desc=Used to accelerate the process of purifying crystals, which allows you to create pure certus quartz crystal, pure nether quartz crystal and pure fluix crystal. Must be powered by an ME Network via the sides with the +, and consumes a steady 8 ae/t while plugged in. Crystal Seeds must be in an adjacent water block to be affected - the seeds will shimmer more rapidly when in the presence of a powered crystal growth accelerator. These do not use a channel.

# Quest: Perfecting Crystal Growth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFDw.name=Perfecting Crystal Growth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFDw.desc=The crystal growth chamber is used for fast crystal growth, and it is possible to increase its speed by installing acceleration cards in an upgrade slot.

# Quest: Wireless Setup
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFEg.name=Wireless Setup
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFEg.desc=Allows you to configure which users, and what permissions the users have with the ME System. By existing it enforces permissions on the usage of the system.%n%nThe security system does not prevent destructive tampering, removing cables / machines or breaking of drives. If you need to protect your system from physical vandalism you will need another form of physical security. This block provides network level security.%n%nThe player who places the ME security terminal has full control over the network and cannot exclude themselves any rights. By adding a blank biometric card you define a default behavior for every player who has no biometric card registered.%n%nIn addition to security on the software layer, you can link up your wireless terminal with the network and access it wirelessly.%n%nIf you have one on your main network, your subnets may also need one to have access to your main network, but this is not always the case depending on how you set it up.%n%n%nThe ME Wireless Access Point wireless access via a wireless terminal. Range and power usage is determined based on the number of wireless boosters installed into the ME wireless access point. A network can have any number of ME wireless access points with any number of wireless boosters in each one, allowing you to optimize power usage and range by altering your setup.

# Quest: Interfacing with Machines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFFg.name=Interfacing with Machines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFFg.desc=The ME Interface is the only component which can be used as a part, or as a Block. Crafting an ME interface in either form by itself produces the other form. The thin form is useful if you want to provide several different interfaces in a single block of physical space, but each will need its own channel. The block form lets multiple other blocks connect to a single ME interface, using only one channel for the interface. The ME Interface acts as an in between when working with pipes, tubes, networks, or machines from other mods.%n%n[note]If you're using a resource pack and the interface's GUI doesn't show up properly, you'll need to delete the assets\appliedenergistics2\textures\guis\interface.png file in your resourcepack zip file.[/note]

# Quest: Interfacing with Inventories
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFFw.name=Interfacing with Inventories
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFFw.desc=The ME Storage Bus, when attached to another inventory block in the world lets you access that inventory via networked functions. This allows you to use chests, barrels, or other types of item storage in your networks.%n%nThe storage via the ME Storage Bus is bidirectional, it can both insert, or extract items from the inventory block it is attached to as long as the ME storage bus has its required channel.%n%nThe UI allows you to control which items are selected as storable items, this selection has no effect on what items can be extracted once they are in the storage.%n%nThe storage bus will function with nearly any inventory block, including ME Interfaces, Minefactory Reloaded DSUs, Factorization barrels, JABBA Barrels, and Better Storage crates. They can also be used to route items passively into Buildcraft pipes.%n%nIf you place a storage bus on an ME Interface the storage bus will be able to interact with the full contents of the target network, unless that interface is configured to store items inside itself, in which case it will see those stored items.

# Quest: Interfacing with Tanks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFGA.name=Interfacing with Tanks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFGA.desc=Storage bus for fluids only.

# Quest: For Fluid Recipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFGQ.name=For Fluid Recipes

# Quest: Extracting Items From the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFGg.name=Extracting Items From the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFGg.desc=The ME export bus extracts items from the ME network's networked storage and places them into the inventory it faces. You must configure which items it will insert, leaving the configuration blank will result in nothing. The ME export bus will try to export any of the items on its list skipping over those it cannot fit into the destination. This is the functional opposite of the ME import bus.

# Quest: Inserting Items Into the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFHA.name=Inserting Items Into the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFHA.desc=Pulls items from the inventory it is pointed at and places them into the ME network's networked storage. You can specify which items it will pull out via the UI, else it tries to pull out any item in the adjacent inventory. The ME import bus will attempt to import any possible options, even if 1 or more of the configured items cannot be stored. This is the functional opposite of the ME export bus.%n%nWhen your machines are very fast, it's better to have them output directly into an ME interface instead, since that works instantly.

# Quest: Emptying Tanks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFHQ.name=Emptying Tanks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFHQ.desc=Import Bus for Fluids only.

# Quest: Something to Put Your Components in
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFHg.name=Something to Put Your Components in
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFHg.desc=An empty storage container, you can insert the vanilla AE2 storage cell parts into it to create a usable storage cell.%n%nYou can also craft it with the storage components when making them to skip combining them.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFHw.desc=The main processor for 1K and 4K cells.%n%nStoring items directly in AE cells is very performant and usually the best option.

# Quest: Automating Crafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFIA.name=Automating Crafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFIA.desc=Is a component of the crafting CPU multiblock. This particular block provides the CPU with no additional features, but can be used as a "filler" block and as a crafting ingredient for the crafting storage, monitor and co-processing units.

# Quest: 1k Item Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFIQ.name=1k Item Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFIQ.desc=Lowest tier storage cell, which can contain 1,024 bytes of storage. 1,024 bytes of storage can hold 127 stacks of a single item, or 65 stacks, while holding 63 different items. The 1k storage cell uses 8 bytes of data to store a single type.%n%nWhen placed inside a drive or chest will consume 0.5 ae/t. It must be in an ME drive or ME chest to be usable.%n%nYou can remove the 1k ME storage component by fully emptying the storage cell, and sneak-clicking it in your hand.%n%nYou can format it in the cell workbench.

# Quest: 1k Component
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFIg.name=1k Component
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFIg.desc=Smallest storage component, used to make 1k ME storage cells, or can be upgraded to make 4k ME storage components. Can be recovered from a crafted 1k ME storage cell by fully emptying the storage cell, and shift-clicking it in your hand.

# Quest: 1k Crafting Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFIw.name=1k Crafting Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFIw.desc=Component of the crafting CPU which provides 1024 bytes of storage for crafting. The Crafting Storage blocks are the only necessary part. Each crafting CPU multiblock allows for a separate crafting job (this is different from sub-tasks of the same job). The more items in the recipe and sub-recipes, the more crafting storage you'll need. Having one big and a couple small might be a good idea, but remember it will try to use the best one available first when you order a craft. They are also used when a crafting card requests a craft, so you'll need several separate ones if you intend to use those a lot. A crafting CPU multiblock uses only one channel, regardless of its size. It must be square to form.

# Quest: 4k Item Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFJA.name=4k Item Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFJA.desc=Second tier storage cell, which can contain 4,096 bytes of storage. 4,096 bytes of storage can hold 508 stacks of a single item, or 260 stacks, while holding 63 different items. The 4k storage cell uses 32 bytes of data to store a single type.%n%nWhen placed inside a drive or chest will consume 1.0 ae/t.

# Quest: 4k Component
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFJQ.name=4k Component
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFJQ.desc=Second smallest storage component, used to make 4k ME storage cells, or can be upgraded to make 16k ME storage components. Can be recovered from a crafted 4k ME storage cell by fully emptying the storage cell, and shift-clicking it in your hand.

# Quest: Co-Processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFLg.name=Co-Processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFLg.desc=Component of the crafting CPU which provides additional item delivery from the CPU to the ME Interface for crafting.%n%nThis can be used to make more assemblers active in parallel for the job, and thus increase overall crafting speed. These only help if your setup has steps properly separated, so the system can run multiple tasks in parallel, or even split the same pattern across multiple interfaces.

# Quest: Recipe Patterns
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFLw.name=Recipe Patterns
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFLw.desc=Save patterns onto these to do autocrafting. They go into molecular assemblers and ME interfaces.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMA.desc=A specialized version of the ME crafting terminal designed to encode blank patterns into encoded patterns.%n%nLets you browse the contents of your network like other terminals, but also contains an area for designing patterns. There are two modes for pattern encoding. Crafting patterns, and processing patterns. Processing patterns are designed for use with machines that do not use standard crafting recipes - such as furnaces, or other machines. To select between modes, click the button to the right of the interface: when it shows a standard crafting table, it will create crafting patterns, and when it shows a furnace, it will create processing patterns.%n%nFor crafting patterns ("Crafts..."), you specify the input crafting materials on a standard 3x3 crafting grid, and the output materials are determined automatically.%n%nFor processing patterns ("Creates..."), you specify the input materials and output materials, including quantity, by placing stacks of items in the interface. If a processing operation is not guaranteed to succeed (such as secondary products from some machines), it will not work correctly as a processing pattern.%n%nWhen designing crafting patterns you can click the output to extract a crafted item as long as you have the materials required to craft the item.%nDon't forget to enable oredict substitution where needed.

# Quest: ME in Your Cleanroom
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMQ.name=ME in Your Cleanroom
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMQ.desc=Wireless Connectors are a close range Quantum Network Bridge alternative.%nConnections are point-to-point - you can't connect more than 2 blocks together. Each block will use 10 + distance * ln(distance^2 + 3) AE/t. Does not work across dimensions. Power needs to be provided on only one side. Up to 32 channels can be transferred through the connection. Can connect directly to dense cables. The Wireless Connector itself does not use any channels.

# Quest: Ore Dictionary Output
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMg.name=Ore Dictionary Output
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMg.desc=The ME ore dictionary export card will attempt to push the configured item/fluid [From the same ore dictionary] from the ME network into a machine or other input inventory. To configure an item/liquid, type in the item's name [e.g. if you want to export all ores put "ore*"]. The rate of export is very fast.%n%n[note]PS: Use crushed* & !crushedPurified* & !crushedCentrifuged* to get any crushed ore, but not ore that has been washed, then crushed (to get purified) or run through the thermal centrifuge.[/note]%n%nThe card can be used in more devices, and causes less lag, but works in a similar way. Put it inside a bus and set the filter using the T looking button that appears. The standalone bus is no longer craftable.

# Quest: To Link P2P Buses
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMw.name=To Link P2P Buses
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMw.desc=A small item that can be used to store, copy, and paste settings. Shift-right-click on a configurable object to save the settings onto the memory card, then right-click on any other block of the same type to paste the settings. Shift-right-click on a non-configurable object (or the air) to clear. They are also used to link the input P2P tunnel to the corresponding output P2P tunnels. They can also link Vis Relays to compatible devices.

# Quest: Smart cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIRw.name=Smart cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIRw.desc=Smart cables are better than glass or covered cables because you can visually see many channels are in use.

# Quest: Dense cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAISA.name=Dense cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAISA.desc=Dense cables are going to be your network backbones. They can transfer 32 channels and display the number of channels in use. Buses and flat interfaces cannot be placed directly on them.

# Quest: Energy Acceptor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIWA.name=Energy Acceptor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIWA.desc=The Energy Acceptor is an alternative place to inject energy into your AE2 network. You can form a "dumb" network with just an EA, but for real capability, you'll want a Controller.%n%n[note]If you're making a subnet, just transfer power over with a Quartz Fiber.[/note]

# Quest: ME Controller
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIWQ.name=ME Controller
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIWQ.desc=The heart of your ME network. You can inject energy into here as well to power your network, but you probably want to save all available spaces for networking. Without this, you're limited to 8 channels.%n%nThis is a multiblock, and can be expanded up to 7x7x7, and can have 2 adjacent blocks in at most 1 axis, or it will be disabled. Whatever that means, just try it out, ok? You can only have one per network.%n%nAbout channels:%nGenerally, every device uses a channel unless specified otherwise. If you don't have enough, that device will not function. If you can't determine what's causing your network problems, try looking at the lines on the smart and dense cables, or use a network visualizer.

# Quest: Diffusion and Coalescence
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0A.name=Diffusion and Coalescence
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0A.desc=The Diffusion and Coalescence cores are basic components needed to make the Thaumic Energistics devices. They're made out of the Formation and Annihilation ones.

# Quest: Exporting Essentia From the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0Q.name=Exporting Essentia From the Network

# Quest: Pulling Essentia Into the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0g.name=Pulling Essentia Into the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0g.desc=Attach to either Alembics or the output of the Advanced Alchemical Furnace. If that doesn't work, have them pipe to a jar and import from there. You can finally get rid of your shifty-eyed golems.

# Quest: Centi-vis in your network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0w.name=Centi-vis in your network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0w.desc=You can use this device to either transfer the contents (CV) of a Vis Relay to another vis relay, an Arcane Assembler, or an Arcane Crafting Terminal. Either way, place the relay on the device (and send some CV to it), and use the memory card to link to the second device. If you send it to another Vis Relay Interface, you'll obviously need another Vis Relay on the other side.

# Quest: Storing Essentia in Jars? Why, again?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1A.name=Storing Essentia in Jars? Why, again?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1A.desc=So apparently you can attach this to a void/oblivion jar and have it void overflow if you set the priority low. Neat, huh?%n%nWhat? Store essentia in jars? Seriously? I guess you could, if you really wanted to, or if there were new, larger jars...

# Quest: Magic Terminals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1Q.name=Magic Terminals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1Q.desc=The Arcane Crafting Terminal is the terminal version on the Arcane Workbench. It can hold a set of vis discount gear in its inventory in addition to a wand. You can also link a vis relay through the network to it to recharge the wand.%n%nThe Essentia Terminal Works like the Fluid Terminal, but for essentia.

# Quest: The Fluid Terminal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1g.name=The Fluid Terminal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1g.desc=The ME Fluid Terminal allows you to directly input and output fluids from the network using buckets, cells, and other fluid-containing items. Put a filled cell (or other item) in the bottom left to have the contents deposited into the network, and the cell moved to the output slot. For the reverse, select a fluid and insert an empty cell, and it'll fill it.

# Quest: Illuminated Panels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1w.name=Illuminated Panels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1w.desc=All terminals are made from these. You'll probably want several.

# Quest: Easier AL automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2A.name=Easier AL automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2A.desc=Unlike regular pattern terminals, the processing pattern terminal doesn't have a crafting mode. Instead, you have a lot more slots for input and output, and the ability to swap them. Great for your Assembly Line patterns. Why not directly make the fluid option? It is a straight upgrade.

# Quest: Making Patterns Quick
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2Q.name=Making Patterns Quick
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2Q.desc=The Pattern Encoder will allow you to use NEIs shift-click ? button functionality to create a crafting pattern even if you don't have the appropriate items.%n%nHowever, you can also drag the items from NEI to do the same thing, though much slower, because you have to look up each component. This is vastly less useful for processing patterns, since it's always 64 items though.

# Quest: Visualizing How Much Your Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2g.name=Visualizing How Much Your Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2g.desc=The ME Storage Monitor allows you to visualize how much of an item you have.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2w.desc=This device will turn on (or off) a redstone signal based on how much of an item you specify (or energy in the network if you select the mode) you have in your network. Left-click an item into the space between the 1000 numbers to add, click again while holding nothing to remove.

# Quest: Why Do I Need to Know How Much Manure Slurry I Have?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3A.name=Why Do I Need to Know How Much Manure Slurry I Have?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3A.desc=These are the fluid versions.

# Quest: Out of Polytetrafluoroethylene? Turn on the LCR!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3Q.name=Out of Polytetrafluoroethylene? Turn on the LCR!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3Q.desc=It's basically the same as a fluid detector cover, except it detects based on what's in your network. Click a cell into the center to specify, and an empty hand to clear.

# Quest: Essentia Level Emitter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3g.name=Essentia Level Emitter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3g.desc=Same as the other two, but for essentia.

# Quest: Was I Out of Nebrisum, or Was it Terminus?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3w.name=Was I Out of Nebrisum, or Was it Terminus?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3w.desc=These are the essentia versions.

# Quest: Beam Me Up, Scotty
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4Q.name=Beam Me Up, Scotty
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4Q.desc=If you want to teleport stuff around using these, you'll need a drive in the SIOP, and at least 6 pylons hooked up. The pylons need to indicate the X, Y and Z dimensions, with you needing 1 more than you would think. If the efficiency goes below 100%%, the AE cost will balloon enormously, so add more pylons to counteract that. After using a redstone signal to activate the SIOP, the blocks will be moved to the spatial IO dim, and the drive will move to the output, so you can send it somewhere else. This is very important to do properly if you want to use it as a teleporter. Otherwise, you can get stuck there. Your network will need to be able to hold all the power needed to teleport at once, so you'll need at least one energy cell. You can only have one Pylon setup per controller, so consider putting them on a subnetwork.%n%nUsing 2 in the X and Z dimensions and 3 in the Y will give you a 1x2x1 teleporter to teleport yourself. You'll want a SIOP port on each side for sending and for receiving. But you'll still need to design a redstone contraption to activate them properly!%n%nRead this if you want to know more about spatial IO in general, and larger setups: [url]https://old.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/3c2b2r/a_treatise_on_nocheat_smp_ae2_spatial_io/[/url]%nAlso see this if you want to see a fancy teleporter: [url]https://old.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/2mhrf8/ae2_spatial_transporters/[/url]%n%n[warn]Spatial cells, once used, will only work in the XYZ dimensions first used, with no way to format or recraft. Test in creative first![/warn]%n%n[warn]Expect your world to lag for a second after using, blame AE.[/warn]

# Quest: Spring Cleaning
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4g.name=Spring Cleaning
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4g.desc=So, when you first started AE, maybe you dumped a bunch of your items into 1k drives, but now you want to clean them up, or empty them to reuse them in making higher tier ones. The ME IO Port will allow you to fill or empty your drives by connecting to the rest of the network.%n%nYou can use the Cell Workbench to format your drives, so they'll only contain the stuff you want. Remember, more item types mean less space overall. You can set them to lapis for example, then put them in the ME IO Port with the transfer direction to the drive to fill it with only that item. Don't put in an unformatted drive while using storage drawers to store tons of stuff! If you want to move your stuff around, put in new drives, then empty old ones, or disconnect your storage drawers temporarily.%n%nYou can use the Workbench to format fluid drives too, and even use cells instead of buckets.%n%nCell Workbenches do not connect to the network, so they don't need a channel.

# Quest: Formatting Gas-er, Essentia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4w.name=Formatting Gas-er, Essentia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4w.desc=This is the essentia version.

# Quest: Alpha and Omega
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ5A.name=Alpha and Omega
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ5A.desc=The ME Annihilation Plane destroys blocks as if you had mined them, and places them into the network. The Identity version acts as if silk touch was used.%n%nThe ME Formation Plane does the opposite, it places blocks into the world. You'll need to tell it what to place/drop though. This can work in both block and item mode.

# Quest: Moar Patterns!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ5g.name=Moar Patterns!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ5g.desc=You may have noticed that the ME Interface's GUI is different that before. That is because with this card you can have more patterns, adding 9 more per card up to a total of 36. HOWEVER, it also uses 4 times the energy for every item when crafting, and this is multiplicative for each new card. If doing large crafts, make sure you have some dense energy cells ready.%n%nSo basically: (sum of amounts of items in the pattern) * config multiplier (which is 10 for GTNH). With cards, it's also multiplied by 4^(number of upgrades)%n%nE.g: (wood log -> planks) in the interface w/o upgrades would draw: 1*10 AE units, which is 5 EU (remember 1 EU = 2 AE)%n(9 charcoal -> charcoal block) compressor recipe in the interface with 3 upgrades will draw 9*10*4^3*0.5 = 2070 EU, but only 45EU without any cards%n%nThey're kind of expensive, so consider holding off if you can't afford the material or EU costs. If you remove it, all the extra patterns will pop out, so be careful of that when moving your stuff.

# Quest: Singular Singularities Signify Something
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ5w.name=Singular Singularities Signify Something
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ5w.desc=Quest names are hard sometimes, ok? To make a Singularity (for the Quantum Network Bridge), you'll need to dump 512,000 items into the Matter Condenser set to Singularity Mode, while using a 64k component or higher.%n%nThen put the Singularity and Enderpearl Dust on the ground and use an explosion (Tiny TNT works well) to create two Quantum Entangled Singularities.%n%nQESs are each a unique pair.

# Quest: Quantum Bridging Your Outposts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6A.name=Quantum Bridging Your Outposts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6A.desc=A Quantum Network Bridge allows you to connect faraway places to your main AE network, even in other dimensions. So you can shove that pollution producing Mega EBF in the Void where it belongs, but still use it from the safety of your main base. To create this, you'll need a Quantum Link Chamber surrounded by Quantum Rings. Then put a Quantum Entangled Singularity in the link chamber, and connect to one of the 4 Quantum Rings around it with a fluix cable. They cost around 1000EU/t for each ring.%n%nYou can power the other side from the first, but you need to jumpstart it first, so bring an energy cell when setting it up. Remember that it's part of the same network, so you can only have one controller, and you're still limited by the channels of the cable you connected with, so you may wish to use the P2P Tunnel to bring more across.%n%nIf you use several, you may wish to rename the QESs.

# Quest: Tools of the Trade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6Q.name=Tools of the Trade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6Q.desc=The Network Tool is AE2's main utility tool.%n%nRight-click on a network to see the power usage, and what makes up the network.%nRight-click on air to interact with its inventory to store cards or turn facades transparent.%nShift-right-click to remove fixtures (import bus, interface, etc.) that don't take up a full block without removing the cable, or remove any AE block immediately the same way.%n%nThe Network Visualizer does exactly what it says, it allows you to visualize the channels of your network. First, right-click a network to select it. At first you'll see everything, but you can change the modes by holding shift and scrolling the mouse wheel up or down to see different things. Remember that if you have a subnetwork, like one that P2P tunnels go through for example, those nodes won't show up since it's a different network, but the P2P tunnels entrances and exits will. This goes through solid objects, so you can look at your whole base.

# Quest: Portable Digital Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6g.name=Portable Digital Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6g.desc=They're exactly what they sound like.%n%nThe first is for items and acts like a terminal. It can hold 4,032 of a single item.%n%nThe second is for liquids, and acts like the fluid terminal. It can hold 128 buckets of a single liquid.%n%nIt costs AE to put things in, take them out, or have the interface open. Use the Wireless Charger from EIO if you don't want it to take forever.

# Quest: Deck of Cards
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6w.name=Deck of Cards
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6w.desc=These cards add additional functionality to certain devices or fixtures. They specify what devices they work on in the tooltip.%n%nThe Redstone Card adds redstone interactivity to the devices it can be used on, with the following options:%nAlways active, active with or without redstone signal, activate once per pulse.%n%nThe Capacity Card adds more slots for items that use them. If you add this to an Export Bus, an icon is added to select item priority.%n%nThe Crafting Card allows you to automatically request autocrafting of items.%nIn an ME Interface, if you put in items to be stocked, if there aren't enough, it'll craft them until it reaches the selected amount. Remember that these are being stocked for crafting recipes that the ME Interface has. If you want them to be seen by the network, you'll need to put a storage bus on the ME Interface.%n%nIn an ME Level Emitter, in the first mode, it'll emit a redstone signal while the specific item is being crafted. In the second, it will emit a redstone signal once a crafting job for the item has been requested, [warn]but it won't send the items to be crafted.[/warn] This is useful if you're using a dummy pattern, and are using the level emitter to tell something else to happen. You still need to get the item(s) requested back into the system so it doesn't tie up a crafting CPU though.%n%nIn an ME Export Bus, it'll attempt to send whatever item(s) are selected in the export bus' GUI. In the first mode, it'll send available items first, then create crafting jobs for the rest. In the second mode, it will only send crafted items.%n%nThe Acceleration Card makes the device/fixture work faster. You'll probably want a lot of these.%n%nThe Inverter Card allows you to invert the item filter of certain fixtures.%n%nThe Fuzzy Card allows you to apply fuzzy logic to filtering to allow items with different NBT or damage data to be counted as the same. This is different from metadata. If you just want it to be fuzzy for nbt, set to Match Any. If it is set to 99%%, it will work on anything that is damaged. You can use the Inverter Card to reverse this.

# Quest: Fluids of the Trade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ7A.name=Fluids of the Trade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ7A.desc=The ME Fluid Auto Filler will add crafting recipes for any fluid in your network that has a bucket version. When crafting a water bucket for example, it will send a bucket to it, and the filled water bucket back.

# Quest: Wireless 2.0
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ7g.name=Wireless 2.0
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ7g.desc=This is the good wireless terminal. It even has crafting. There's a bit of lag when you open it, but the convenience it worth it, right? You can't pull out fluids, but you can hold on to the universal one if you want.%n%nThe Magnet Card does not pull items to you. Instead, it allows you to automatically deposit them into the network. You can right-click to change the white/blacklist, or shift-right-click to change the mode.

# Quest: Cut the Power!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8A.name=Cut the Power!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8A.desc=The ME Toggle Bus allows you to cut off access through a cable if it doesn't receive a redstone signal. The inverted version is, well, inverted. It must be placed between the cables, like a Quartz Fiber.

# Quest: Providing Essentia on Demand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8Q.name=Providing Essentia on Demand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8Q.desc=The Essentia and Infusion Providers both do basically the same thing, send essentia to a device that requests it for crafting.%n%nThe Essentia Provider needs to be next to the device, it's mostly for the Thaumatorium. Since it's effectively a magic ME Interface, you can also use it instead of an Essentia Import Bus next to your Alembics or the Advanced Alchemical Furnace.%n%nThe Infusion Provider is for devices that draw essentia through the air, like the Runic Matrix (infusion) or Overchanting Table. It doesn't need to be next to the device.%n%nThey both obviously need the essentia they request to be accessible by the network to work.

# Quest: Ordering Essentia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8g.name=Ordering Essentia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8g.desc=The Distillation Pattern Encoder allows you to automatically melt down items in your alchemical furnace to provide essentia.%nFirst, place something that is already scanned in the device, along with a blank pattern. You can create the pattern by clicking the button, or click the different aspects to select one that is not the highest. This will create a pattern of item -> essentia. Then use an ME Interface pointing at a furnace with the pattern in it. You can now craft that type of essentia the same way you would a normal craft, but through the Essentia Terminal.%n%n[warn]There isn't a way to have the system craft essentia on demand for a craft, unfortunately.[/warn]

# Quest: Autocrafting Magic Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8w.name=Autocrafting Magic Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8w.desc=The Arcane Assembler works like a combination of the Molecular Assembler and the Arcane Workbench, allowing you to autocraft anything crafted in the latter. You need to link a vis relay through the network to supply essentia to it, and a Knowledge Core with recipes on it for to work. Additionally, you can add vis discount gear into the interface to take advantage of the discount. The base discount starts at 20%%. For each Acceleration card, the time taken will reduce by 20%%, and increase power used by 50%%. For every point of warp on the discount gear, the power costs increase by 15%%.%n%nThe knowledge core holds up to 21 patterns for use in the Arcane Assembler, but you need a new assembler for every knowledge core if you want to autocraft more than that.%n%nTo encode the patterns, you need a Knowledge Inscriber. It works exactly as you would expect. It doesn't connect to the network, so it doesn't need a channel. If you want to erase a pattern select it and the save icon should become erase instead.

# Quest: Miscellaneous AE Items
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ9A.name=Miscellaneous AE Items
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ9A.desc=There are several AE items that aren't particularly useful, but probably deserve mention, so here they are:%n%nCertus Tanks: They hold 32B and are portable and easy to make.%n%nView Cell: Format in a Cell Workbench to filter what you see in a terminal (when they're installed in it)%n%nCertus/Nether Quartz Cutting Knives: Right-click to open interface and choose a name. The press can be used in the Inscriber to name stuff without using an anvil. You can also rename p2p tunnels and interfaces in world with the knife.%n%nME Block Container: Holds only one type of item, but the amount of a 64k drive. Can place the item in world, or replace in a 1x1 or 3x3 area. Blocks replaced will be dumped in world. This will be horizontal or vertical depending on which side of a block you select. Shift-right-click air to change mode, right-click a block to activate mode.%n%nCharged Quartz Fixture: Emits light at the same level as a torch, but fancier.%n%nLight Detecting Fixture: Emits redstone signal based on light. Since it only starts at 7, it's not as useful as the Light Sensor.%n%nME Upgrade (Tier 1/2/3): If you're an OC person, there are 3 upgrades you can make to add access to your network from robots and drones.%nT1: 0.5 access point range%nT2: Normal access point range%nT3: Unlimited range, any dim%n%nEntropy Manipulator: Changes grass/dirt/dried dirt into each other, or starts fires. Or melts ice. Useless.%n%nMatter Cannon: Shoots Matter Balls made in the Matter Condensor. Put it in an ME Chest or Drive and put items in a Terminal to fill. Decent I guess? But it destroys blocks every time you use it, so... Well, I guess you could use it with Paint Balls?%n%nColor Applicator: Use dye items or Paint Balls (more efficient) to dye stuff. You can dye cables, or anything Forge-compatible, like wool or glass. Place items inside like the Matter Cannon. You can cycle through the colors by holding shift and right-clicking, or scrolling the mouse wheel. If you use snow balls, you can remove paint instead. You can also use it in a dispensor.%n%nWalrus: It's a walrus, what were you expecting?

# Quest: Magical Minions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ9Q.name=Magical Minions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ9Q.desc=You can use the Wireless Golem Backpack to connect your golem to the network if it's close enough to an access point. See the Thaumonomicon for details.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJzw.desc=Contains up to a 128^3 area inside it. This is 2,097,152 blocks. Teleport a village to the Moon to make them suffer!

# Quest: Short Guide - A Basic AE2 System
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKwQ.name=Short Guide - A Basic AE2 System
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKwQ.desc=So you've unlocked AE2, but don't know how to use it? Not to worry, that's what this questline is for. For a basic (and not completely useless) ME system, make the items on the right first. After you go through the quests to get them normally of course.%n%n[note]You could technically make one with an ME Chest, but there'd be no advantage over using a regular chest.[/note]%n%nConnect power to the Energy Acceptor, place the ME Drive next to it, place a Fluix Cable on top of the ME Drive connect the ME Terminal to the cable. Just put in the Storage cells, and you're done! Remember you need a Network Tool to see how much power it actually uses. Also, it lets you pick up stuff easier.%n%nTo save power, let's do a little extra work. Place the Pressure Plate two spaces in front of the ME Terminal, place redstone next to it and beside the Energy Acceptor. Remove the EA and place a Fluix Cable there, and then place the ME Toggle Bus between the Drive and where the Energy Acceptor will be. Then plunk that back down and re-power it. This will cause it to only connect (and thus use power) when you stand on the plate. This tiny network uses about 38 EU by itself, so you should understand that an ME system is not cheap either in materials or power.%n%nYou should make either 1k or 4k storage cells to put into your ME Drive.

# Quest: Short Guide - External Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKwg.name=Short Guide - External Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKwg.desc=Drawers are great, right? Well, let's connect your ME system to a bank of them. Set up some drawers nearby with a controller attached. Then place an ME Storage Bus against the controller and set the priority to +1. This will prioritize I/O to the drawer controller. Lock your drawers before they fill with random stuff. Now you have access to the whole thing! Great for the results of mining, and anything else you have thousands of, while keeping your ME system relatively empty.%n%nYou can also connect to chests and other things if you want. You can use an Ender Chest to send stuff into your network, which will then send it to the drawers, but you'll have stuff entering and exiting constantly, so it'll mess up your view in the Terminal. You can use filtered view cells, or process them before they go into your ME network (or in a different one) and/or send them to the DC directly via another EC. It depends on what you want to do and what it is.%n%n[warn]Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will tank TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.[/warn]

# Quest: Short Guide - Autocrafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKww.name=Short Guide - Autocrafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKww.desc=This is the main purpose of AE2, so let's get to it. Plunk down the Crafting Storage and Molecular Assembler, connect the Pattern Terminal to a cable, and attach the ME Interface to the MA (make sure it has power from another side). You could run it without a ME Interface, but you can only do one recipe then. Place a Blank Pattern in the Pattern Terminal, and add the recipe for a Crafting Table, then click the arrow to save it to the pattern. Put this in the ME Interface and you can now request a craft of it. (if the items are in the network, otherwise it'll fail obviously)%n%nFor processing patterns (machines, anything not regular 3x3 crafting) click the button on the right. You'll need to specify all I/O for it yourself. You can use this on an ME Interface on a furnace (for example), combined with an ME Import Bus to collect the results. If it's a machine that auto-ejects (like multis) you can use a ME Interface to collect the results much faster (and with less lag).

# Quest: Short Guide - P2P
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKxA.name=Short Guide - P2P
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKxA.desc=One of the more complicated parts of AE2, you'll need to understand this to really get anywhere with the mod. First, replace your EA with an ME Controller. Now you have a bunch more channels to work with. Place the P2P Bus against one of the sides and then connect some cables to it to a place a bit away. Make sure to send power to this cable with an EA or Quartz Fiber, but NOT a normal cable, this is now a separate network, and that would cancel that. Connect the second P2P Bus to the other end, and then place at least 1 Dense Cable coming off of it. Shift-right-click your 1st P2P Bus, then right-click the 2nd. They're now connected, and there are 2 channels being used on your subnetwork, while you have the full 32 from the side of your Controller to use. For each subnetwork that doesn't have an ME Controller, you can send 4 sides, or 128 channels. I'm sure you can understand how useful this is, right?%n%nThere's lots more to understand about AE2, but you should probably either experiment, read the quests, or watch a video for more than the basics.

# Quest: Applied Greg?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALPQ.name=Applied Greg?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALPQ.desc=ME Buses are combination of technology and...other technology. Don't give me that look, it is, ok? With these, you can now directly I/O items between GregTech multiblock and ME network. They have §osignificantly§r less lag, so please start using them as soon as possible on servers.%n%nYou just pop off your GT bus + ME bus or ME interface combination, and replace both with the new bus and connect a ME cable directly to it. It uses 1 channel, same as the other options.%n%nThe output bus and hatch have limited output space. If you need more, you can upgrade them either by crafting them with storage components or putting a cell inside. A digital singularity cell will make the cache near infinite.%n%nNote that the output bus must eject each item from its cache §oin order§r. If it cannot eject the topmost item, it will be stuck and cannot eject any other items.%n%nIf voiding is turned off, the multiblock will not void when the ME Outputs are full.%n%n[note]For usage in some machines, i.e. the advanced assembly line, the configured item must be in the first slot in order for the multi to work.[/note]

# Quest: AE2 Fluid Crafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsg.name=AE2 Fluid Crafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsg.desc=Fluid crafting directly integrated in your ME system. NO WAY!%n%nAE2FC is a powerful addon that was backported for GTNH.%n%nNow, what do you need to get that juicy stuff working?%nEvery ME System needs a Fluid Discretizer. It allows for on demand crafting. While you can use AE2FC without Fluid Discretizer for moving fluids, you need a Discretizer for autocrafting.%n%nThen you also need a Fluid Terminal or a Fluid Processing Terminal for the Assembly Line.%n%nWhen creating patterns you will notice your fluids being placed as if they were items.%nYour finished patterns will look blue-ish. Placing those in a Dual Interface will allow AE2 to push the fluids and items both. Note. Fluids are being sent first, then items.%nYou can switch the dual interface on the top right if you want it to keep fluids in stock.%n%nIf you use a blue pattern (fluid pattern) in a normal interface, AE2 will send the fluid as a fluid packet. This is just a representation of the fluid as an item. A fluid decoder can turn it back into a fluid and saves it in the fluid grid.%n%nYou can use an ingredient buffer (large or normal) so your items and fluids sent by a pattern can get stored internally in one block. The normal buffer can hold 9 items and 4 fluids whereas the large one can hold 27 items and 7 fluids. It is not needed, but you can use it to automate things with item and fluid conduits.%n%nIf you want to automate single blocks it's as easy as eating chocolate cake while on a diet:%nMake the pattern, make an interface, boom- done! It will automatically insert the fluid in the fluid inventory of a single block machine.%n%nEven automating more difficult things like the Assembly Line becomes much easier with these tools.%n%nIf you need more detailed information, visit the wiki:%n%n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/AE2FC[/url]%n%n[note]The Extra Cells mod has been removed. Any old components and cells were converted to AE2 and AE2FC parts where possible.[/note]

betterquesting.quest.Hbq2zJcoQbWK20-2A-kI1Q.name=Get Your Priorities Straight
betterquesting.quest.Hbq2zJcoQbWK20-2A-kI1Q.desc=You might find yourself setting up complicated systems involving many storage buses with differing priorities. To make it less tedious, grab a priority card!%n%nThis tool allows you to set many buses to the same priority with a single click... but better yet, it also features §nincrement and decrement modes!§r Every time you click on a bus, the priority will be set to one higher/lower than the previous bus you clicked, so setting up large arrays of descending priorities is a breeze.

# Quest: To Scan or Not to Scan
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-A.name=To Scan or Not to Scan
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-A.desc=In order to get into bee breeding, you need a way to see all the traits, active and inactive. You only want to breed so called "pure" bees; For those, both "Active" and "Inactive" traits are identical.%n%n[note]BTW, it's not like the more 'advanced' versions are actually better, just that they have more functions.

# Quest: To Play God
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-g.name=To Play God
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-g.desc=In order to continue with bees, to mutate and breed them as you like, you need mutagen. This greenish, smelly liquid needs to be refined from bacterial sludge that seems to be available only on Mars. You will be able to continue, once you've arrived there.%n%nIn the meantime you can start working with the Genetics mod, since we all know Gendustry is too easy... Check out the recipes and you'll understand why you should look into the Genetics mod.%n%n[note]Make sure to make more with the Vat once you can actually make it.[/note]

# Quest: Upgraded Home
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-w.name=Upgraded Home
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-w.desc=The Bee House can be used to stabilize mutations, for example if you have successfully bred two different bees, but the passive traits are different from the active ones.%n%nTo actually breed those together to get a new species, you'll need something different - the Apiary. Building them will require a Carpenter and Impregnated frames, along with Seed Oil and Creosote - quite a bit of industrialization! Or, if you're lucky, you can find a beekeeper villager to trade with. Maybe you can help the villagers §lget lucky§r to make more beekeeper villagers? If only Cupid and his bow were around...%n%nProduction rates in an empty Apiary are low - lower than a Bee House by quite a bit, in fact. But the Apiary has two big advantages - Frames, and Automation. You can now use your Untreated or Impregnated frames in here to boost output - and the boost is multiplied. So 3 x2 frames gives you 2 * 2 * 2 = 8x extra output! You can also automate I/O for the bees and their products, though not frames unfortunately.%n%nBees also don't live as long as in a Bee House, but that's actually a good thing.%n%nAlso, you should check the Genetics mod for useful machines. The Acclimatiser can give very picky bees a much wider temperature or humidity tolerance without having to breed it into them.

# Quest: First Things First

# Quest: A New Home
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB9g.name=A New Home
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB9g.desc=Now that you've destroyed the poor bees' homes, you should build them a new one. The humble Bee House will not let your bees mutate into new species. But you'll need the combs anyways for better housing. The production rate isn't too bad, but they cannot be automated.%n%nOne tip - Put some vanilla saplings near the Bee Houses. Bee Houses give a natural boost of 3x to pollination vs better housing. The bees will pollinate them and you might get lucky and start getting some Forestry tree crossbreeding. Stick with Oak and Birch trees, they'll give you a nice mix of starter Forestry trees.%n%nOf course, if you do this without taking precautions, you may find yourself swarmed by laggy butterflies...%n%nYou may also notice that bees with the 'flower' type flower spread flowers. This can be used to get, say, lavender, among others. If you don't like them spreading them everywhere, replace the dirt/grass blocks, remove the trait, or reduce the pollination speed/territory.

# Quest: Analyze Them All
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB9w.name=Analyze Them All
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB9w.desc=Every bee has multiple properties that define what the bee does, how it behaves in rain or at night, and a couple of other aspects. It is mandatory to keep track of those properties. This kit isn't very good since it doesn't give you information on their Inactive attributes, but waste not, want not.%n%nYou'll need to use paper to analyze each bee.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_Q.desc=With this machine, you can extract a random trait from any bee, sapling, butterfly or flower. The bee/sapling/butterfly/flower will be destroyed in this process. Each process requires an empty gene sample and some labware.%n%nThe resulting sample is random, so make sure to recycle the extra gene samples you don't want.

# Quest: Diamondware
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_g.name=Diamondware
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_g.desc=Also known as labware. Be prepared. In order to do serious bee-work, you need stacks of diamonds. I'm not joking, stacks! Better start working on that diamond bee!

# Quest: Genetic Imprinter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_w.name=Genetic Imprinter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_w.desc=With this powerful machine, you can inject gene samples, which allows you to alter any aspect of your bee, tree or butterfly. The gene sample (or pattern) will not be destroyed.%n%nThe machine has 30%% chance to downgrade pristine into ignoble and 80%% chance to kill ignoble bees.%n%nOne labware is consumed per operation.

# Quest: Genetic Transposer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAA.name=Genetic Transposer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAA.desc=DNA samples of species and/or traits are pretty valuable. You always should keep at least one of each gene sample you get your hand on in a chest somewhere safe. By using this machine, you are able to copy any gene sample, for the cost of an empty serum vial and some labware.%n%n[note]You don't actually need to keep all of them if you don't intend to use them of course.[/note]

# Quest: Advanced Mutatron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAQ.name=Advanced Mutatron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAQ.desc=A more advanced version of the mutatron. It uses more energy to mutate a drone with a princess, and you can select which mutation you want to have. This machine is a must-have for high-tier bees.%n%n[note]You'll need neutronium bees to make this.[/note]

# Quest: Blank Gene Samples
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAg.name=Blank Gene Samples
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAg.desc=To get the various traits from a bee, you need a lot of power, labware and an empty gene sample. You don't need a lot of those, as you can just throw them in a furnace to remove remaining DNA of traits you don't need or want.%n%nIn the meantime you can start working with the Genetics mod, since we all know Gendustry is too easy... Genetics is used for bees, trees, and Botany flowers so it gets its own quest tab. Gendustry is really good for bees, but will require top tier equipment.

# Quest: Genetic Template
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAw.name=Genetic Template
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAw.desc=Templates are used to combine multiple gene samples into one large batch. It can be used to apply multiple traits at once, but you can also replicate a bee from liquid DNA and protein, if you manage to fill all 13 traits in one template. These templates can also be copied, just like the small samples.

# Quest: A Rather Cruel Disposal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBA.name=A Rather Cruel Disposal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBA.desc=You'll probably end up with a lot of excess drones while doing bees. (Or saplings if you do trees). Instead of throwing them away, you could also turn them into... something useful.

# Quest: Arnie's Blender
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBQ.name=Arnie's Blender
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBQ.desc=They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. This machine turns raw meat into liquid protein, which is used to create bees from scratch. Which has §oabsolutely§  nothing§r to do with breakfast.

# Quest: And There Shall be Light
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBg.name=And There Shall be Light
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBg.desc=Out of princesses to inject traits to? Too lazy to find hives and get more bees? Not a problem. With this nifty little device, you can use a ton of power, liquid DNA and protein to create any bee you wish to have. The only drawback is: All bees will be ignoble, which means they will die after a random amount of cycles after 90.%n%nOf course, there's an upgrade for the industrial apiary to deal with that

# Quest: Only the Best: Temperature
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBw.name=Only the Best: Temperature
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBw.desc=On your way to awesome bees, you have to collect only the best traits available.%n%n[note]None is for testing jubilant state, while 3 is what you'll have on most of the time.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEA.desc=On your way to awesome bees, you have to collect only the best traits available. Bees with Cave can work in housing that is covered - by more housing!

# Quest: Go Find Some Tropical Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4A.name=Go Find Some Tropical Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4A.desc=Next you'll need to find some tropical bees. The hives can be found in Jungle biomes. Be careful as these bees are very aggressive and can poison you. Collect the silky combs and extract some silk wisp from those in order to make some Apiarist's clothes. Try to get pristine bees. If you're having trouble finding them, you can use Nature's Compass to search for a specific biome.

# Quest: Silky Combs and Propoli
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4Q.name=Silky Combs and Propoli
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4Q.desc=Collect silky combs and extract some silk wisp out of it in order to make some Apiarist's clothes.%n%nThis can take a very long time, so parallelize!%n%nUse a GregTech or Forestry Centrifuge to get Silky Propoli. For higher tier (and useful) combs you need a GT centrifuge.

# Quest: Woven Silk
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4w.name=Woven Silk
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4w.desc=Centrifuge your silky propoli to get some silk wisp at a chance of 60 percent. Put 9 silk wisp in the Forestry carpenter or GregTech assembler to get woven silk.%n%nThis fine fabric can be used for crafting Apiarist's Clothes or to upgrade a Forestry Backpacks to 45 slots.

# Quest: Apiarist's Cloth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD5A.name=Apiarist's Cloth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD5A.desc=If you have collected 24 woven silk you can make a complete Apiarist's suit to be protected from bee stings and other bad bee effects. You can also use the suit parts to upgrade your EnderIO Dark Steel Armor to have the same effect.

# Quest: A Chest for Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEVw.name=A Chest for Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEVw.desc=A chest for bees only. It can hold up to 125 different bees in one chest.

# Quest: Frames
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWA.name=Frames
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWA.desc=Untreated frames are the simplest frames. They do not work in bee houses, only in apiaries or alvearies. You will need them to craft bee houses.%n%nThey increase the bee's performance. Each untreated frame will double a bee's productivity.

# Quest: Impregnated Frames
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWQ.name=Impregnated Frames
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWQ.desc=Impregnated Frames are even better than untreated Frames.%nEach frame doubles the bee's productivity. It has a longer durability than the untreated frame, but a shorter one compared to the proven frame.

# Quest: Production Frames
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWg.name=Production Frames
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWg.desc=You can make proven frames or purchase them from a villager. If you can't find a beekeeper, there are a couple of different options to get one. Rescue a zombie villager, add doors to a village to get them to make kids, or perhaps use a cupid's bow and arrow...%n%nAbout magic frames:%nThey're the core of magically endowed frames. They also have a special ability - no maximum production chance. Normal frames are ineffective to get above 16x production (4 frames) but with magic frames you can keep going - just watch out, above 16x you'll be working your bees so hard they have a chance to degenerate into ignoble ones. This can happen any bee tick, not just when they die. Frames to lower genetic decay will lower the chances of this happening.%n%nOf course, with very long lifespans, high production genes, swarmers, and tons of frames, you may think this is worth it.%n%nNote that normal products have a cap of 200%% produced, and specialties 100%%.

# Quest: Alvearies
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEYw.name=Alvearies
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEYw.desc=The alveary is an advanced variant of the apiary. The alveary allows for combs to be produced faster due to its natural speed increase to production (as well as the ability to add up to six frames via the Extra Bees frame housings) and due to its ability to be modified by other blocks.%n%nIt is possible to adjust the internal temperature of the alveary using the alveary heater or alveary fan in order to accommodate bees that require hotter or colder climates.%n%nCertain bees will not produce their specialty items unless they are Jubilant. This requires matching their preferred Temperature/Humidity, without any genetic modifiers. Some bees also need a block of something beneath them as well.%n%nIt is also possible to use mutators to increase chances of mutation, alveary lighting and alveary rain shield to allow bees without the nocturnal and tolerant flyer traits to work during the night and rain, respectively, and the swarmer to use excess royal jelly to create princesses that last for a limited number of generations.%n%n[note]If you're mutating bees that need a specific block in it, you need to place the required block under the middle bottom, and have the one directly above be a normal alveary block.[/note]

# Quest: Humid and Warm?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF5w.name=Humid and Warm?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF5w.desc=Stop guessing what the humidity and temperature are for your biome. Use the habitat locator to get a reading on your current climate.

# Quest: Put the Drones in a Jar and Shake it Up
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6A.name=Put the Drones in a Jar and Shake it Up
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6A.desc=Once you get good effects from your bees, instead of just trashing the excess drones, you can put them in collector's jars to get the effects anywhere in your base.%n%nHealing? XP? Poison?%n%nThe collector's jars can even be piped or connected to a conveyor so that drones last a long time.%n%n[note]PS: Using the regen effect of Imperial bees while doing Blood Magic may be useful.[/note]

# Quest: Death to Bees!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6Q.name=Death to Bees!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6Q.desc=These frames will let you kill your bees faster. It's to breed the next generation sooner, right? Not because you don't like them?

# Quest: Keep Them Around
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6g.name=Keep Them Around
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6g.desc=These frames will keep your bees buzzing for longer. If you care, that is.

# Quest: Are the Bees Buzzing, or Screaming?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6w.name=Are the Bees Buzzing, or Screaming?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6w.desc=These frames cause mutations at an increased rate. They're super useful.%n%nAbout the stats on frames you see when holding shift, you'll note that some have a different number in brackets next to them, this means that this is the maximum they can be stacked. This only applies to the Extra Bees ones.%n%nThe stats on the frames are also multiplicative instead of additive, so after 4 frames in an alveary, soul frames will max out. On the other hand, accelerated frames will take 9 to get there, but you can just keep on going.%n%nIf you pile up the multipliers, 5x from stimulator, 3x from mutator, and 4x1.8x frames, it'll get you to 157x, getting you those 1%% bees in a single generation!

# Quest: Bees Buzzing Beyond the Dark
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF7A.name=Bees Buzzing Beyond the Dark
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF7A.desc=If even the soul frame takes too long for your taste, the oblivion frame will destroy a bee in a single bee tick (27s). Be careful using more than one, there are rumors it might harm your princesses...%n%n[note]You can find them in Stronghold libraries or make them from Dragon Eggs. You can also use a Thaumic Restorer to fix it, and most frames too.[/note]

# Quest: Upgrade Your Forestry Backpack
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFVw.name=Upgrade Your Forestry Backpack
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFVw.desc=With your woven silk you can upgrade your Forestry backpacks. Each Pack has 45 slots.%n%nYou need a carpenter, your old backpack and a bit of seed oil.%n%nIf the recipe isn't working, put the bag in a crafting grid to reset its nbt data. After removing anything in it of course.

# Quest: Analyzer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHog.name=Analyzer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHog.desc=The Analyzer is a machine that acts in an identical way to the Forestry Analyzer, in that it reveals the genome of bees, trees, butterflies and flowers. It can also be used to reveal the gene present on the DNA Sequence. Unlike the Analyzer, the Analyzer uses power (RF or EU) and DNA Dye to stain chromosomes and determine the genome directly. The analyzer takes 15 seconds to analyze a single individual.%n%nInformation from these quests was taken from Binnie's wiki at [url]https://binnie.mods.wiki/wiki/Tutorial/Genetics[/url]

# Quest: Master Registry
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI7g.name=Master Registry
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI7g.desc=The master beekeeper needs a master registry. Make sure you don't get any tears in your apiaries as you collect all the requirements!

# Quest: Welcome to Biology Class!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIQ.name=Welcome to Biology Class!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIQ.desc=Binnie's Genetics mod will allow you to pick and chose traits for bees, trees and Botany flowers. But not for free! Doing this comes at a price.%n%nIt's better to provide power to an Ender IO capacitor and then power these machines with RF, instead of powering directly with GT EU, because they don't work well with GT's EU amp system.

# Quest: Making Bees More Comfortable
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIg.name=Making Bees More Comfortable
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIg.desc=The acclimatiser is a key machine for breeding your bees. With lots of power and the appropriate ingredients you can toughen your bees to thrive anywhere. It's recommend to use an EnderIO capacitor to power this device. However, even with climate hardiness your bees still won't produce special items unless they are in their favorite climate. Along with the bee, put in these items to adjust the bee's traits:%n%nSnowball - More cold tolerance%nLava - More heat tolerance%nSand - More dry tolerance%nWater - More wet tolerance%n%nYou should know that the acclimatiser doesn't return capsules or cells. The amount of items needed is pretty random.%n%n[note]A nice trick is to start with a bee that already has both. Then you can use either direction to increase it further! You don't need any lava if you do it like this. And no cells either. You can just use sand and snowballs.[/note]

# Quest: Incubator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKA.name=Incubator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKA.desc=This is a crafting machine that heats items and liquids to a temperature that encourages bacterial growth.%n%nThe first step of incubation is the creation of Liquid Growth Medium, which is made from incubating Water and Growth Medium. This is subsequently incubated with Wheat to give Bacteria. This solution of bacteria can then be incubated a third time with Sugar to give Enzyme. This is an important compound used in other machines.%n%nThe best way to create enzyme is therefore to chain three incubators together, for each step of the process.

# Quest: Bees By the Millions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKQ.name=Bees By the Millions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKQ.desc=If you need endgame high speed production, industrial apiaries are the way to go. Industrial Apiaries take upgrade frames that never break. Production frames can be stacked up to 8 high. It also has many options for emulation, more pollen retrieval, and others.%n%nThe Industrial Apiary is now a GT machine. It takes up to UV voltage and up to 4 amps but the base usage is just 37 eu/t. You can no longer use a World Accelerator and there is only the one machine, so no GT overclocking. Instead, there are new §oacceleration upgrades§r that act similar to a World Accelerator but are directly integrated into the machine. You will want to use them, they increase the speed and energy usage by a lot. The final tier also increases productivity.%n%nBut I shouldn't drone on too long. Go make one and find out yourself.

# Quest: Fastest Way to Get There
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKg.name=Fastest Way to Get There
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKg.desc=A GT++ Mutagenic frame will get your bees to their final destination faster than you can blink. Just remember to wear your rubber suit while making it!%n%n[note]These will break in the alveary before they take effect since their durability is under 6. So you can only get to 125x, but I think that's enough, don't you?[/note]

# Quest: Upgrading the Alveary
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKw.name=Upgrading the Alveary
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKw.desc=These basic upgrades to the Alveary make it more powerful.%n%nFrame Housing - Automation-enabled frame slot for the Alveary. Uses §55 durability§r every bee tick (27s). If it runs out on that tick, it has no effect.%nAveary Stabilizer - Prevents the bees from mutating into another species. Ideal for breeding traits into a line.%nAlveary Transmission - Power input for upgrades that use power.%nHatchery - Hatches larval bees for use in Genetics or to create additional drones. Not used for Gendustry stuff.%nAlveary Sieve - Instead of the pollen from a bee fertilizing a nearby tree, it is stored here and can be manually applied. Requires manually placing woven silk in the inventory.%nSwarmer - Creates additional Ignoble queens in hives around the Alveary. These are genetic copies of the original. This uses royal jelly or aromatic lumps. The latter are more effective.%n%n[note]Note that all upgrade blocks must be in the bottom 2 layers. The center block also cannot be an upgrade block, though the bottom center can.[/note]%n%n[warn]When using power, the transmission block will suck down entire amps to fill a tiny amount. Use the EIO capacitors or something similar to prevent this.[/warn]

# Quest: Busy Bees Buzzing Boldly
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILA.name=Busy Bees Buzzing Boldly
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILA.desc=These upgrades can significantly increase your production rate by keeping your bees from stopping production due to the environment.%n%nRain Shield - Can work through the rain%nLighting - Can work day and night%nAlveary Heater - Increases temperature a flat 20%% each (needs power)%nAlveary Fan - Decreases temperature a flat 20%% each (needs power)%nAlveary Hygroregulator[sic] - Has two modes, water and lava%nLava - Temp+10%%, Humidity-20%%%nWater - Temp-10%%, Humidity+20%%%n%nUnfortunately, there's no way to make them like caves with a block.

# Quest: A Stim a Day Keeps the Doctor Awake
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILQ.name=A Stim a Day Keeps the Doctor Awake
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILQ.desc=Supporting circuit boards that can hold 4 electron tubes, the Electrical Stimulator provides a variety of functions. All numbers are in percent:%n%nIron ET - Production: 150 (Max 500)%nDiamantine ET - Production: 250 (Max 1000)%nApatine ET - Pollination: 150 (Max 500)%nObsidian ET - Lifespan: 80 (Min 20)%nLapis ET - Lifespan: 150 (Max 500)%nBlazing ET - Simulates hellish temperature%nGolden ET - Mutation rate: 150 (Max 500)%nTin ET - Territory: 40 (Min 10) Prod: 90 (Min 50)%nBronze ET - Territory: 150 (Max 500)%n%nGenetic Decay is also increased by 50%% for all of them. This affects how long until ignoble bees die off, so don't worry about it if your bees are pristine.

# Quest: X-Men, or Should I Say X-Bee?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILg.name=X-Men, or Should I Say X-Bee?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILg.desc=The Mutator can vastly accelerate genetic mutations, even allowing those ultra rare bees to be bred. Items inserted into the Mutator control how much mutation it causes.%n%nSoul Sand - 50 percent increase%nEnder Pearl - 100 percent increase%nEye of Ender - 300 percent increase

# Quest: Genepool
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILw.name=Genepool
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILw.desc=Another important resource is Raw DNA. This can be obtained from any breedable organism such as bees, trees or flowers, and is created in the Genepool. The Genepool requires both Ethanol and Enzyme to digest the DNA, and will destroy the organism. Note this gives raw DNA, and does not preserve any genes or alleles present.

# Quest: Isolator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMA.name=Isolator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMA.desc=The Isolator acts in a similar way to the Genepool, but does not completely destroy genes. It instead allows the isolation of a single gene from an organism, without destroying it. The exact gene is random, and is written into a Blank Sequence. Until the sequence is analyzed in an Analyzer, it will be unknown what the gene is. It doesn't however need to be analyzed before being sent to the Sequencer.

# Quest: Sequencer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMQ.name=Sequencer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMQ.desc=After obtaining a DNA Sequence with the gene that you wish, it must be placed in the Sequencer. This uses Fluorescent Dye to determine the correct sequence, and when completed logs the discovery. The important thing here is that the discovery goes to the person who placed the machine.%n%nGenes are sequenced faster if the sequence has been placed in a Polymeriser first to increase the strength.

# Quest: Polymeriser
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMg.name=Polymeriser
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMg.desc=Serums and sequences can be placed in a Polymeriser to increase their strength and amount of DNA held within. Serums need to be polymerised at least once before being used in the inoculator. To polymerise, both Raw DNA and Polymerising Bacteria are required. Raw DNA is obtained from the Genepool, and Polymerising Bacteria is made from incubating bacteria with bonemeal. Gold nuggets can be used as a catalyst to speed up the process.

# Quest: Gene Database
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMw.name=Gene Database
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMw.desc=Discovered genes are logged into the Gene Database. This handheld device lists all genes by the type of organism they apply to. To add a gene to an Empty Serum Vial to allow inoculation, the desired gene can be clicked on while holding the vial. An Empty Serum Array can be used to hold more than one gene at once.

# Quest: Lab Stand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINA.name=Lab Stand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINA.desc=The Lab Stand is a block on which an Apiarist Database, Arborist Database, Botanist Database or Gene Database can be placed by right-clicking on the placed stand with the database, attaching it and allowing the database to be accessed by right-clicking on the stand.

# Quest: Registry
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINg.name=Registry
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINg.desc=The Registry combines the existing four databases into a new sleek browser to allow the properties, mutations and genes of all discovered bees, trees, butterflies and flowers.

# Quest: Inoculator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINw.name=Inoculator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINw.desc=The final step is inoculation. Currently the only machine capable of inserting genes is the Inoculator. This uses Bacteria Vector, created by incubating Bacteria and Blaze Powder, to transfer the gene into organisms.%n%nOnly the young stage of organisms can be injected, which are larvae (bees), pollen (trees and flowers) and caterpillars (butterflies). Bee larvae can be converted into drones by incubating with Liquid Growth Medium.

# Quest: Tools for the Geneticist

# Quest: Ghetto Biome Changing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcA.name=Ghetto Biome Changing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcA.desc=If you don't want to change the biome to a specific one, and just want a neutral environment for your bees, maybe using nodes is for you. You can try planting a Silverwood Sapling to get one with a pure node, or use other methods to move one.%n%nKeep in mind a 'bare' pure node won't change anything unless it has Victus. You can try to use Sinister or Tainted, but...no refunds. These nodes have a radius of 11. To change the biome back, use an Ethereal Bloom (radius of 7). Keep in mind that both Pech and Wisps spawn in 'Magical' type biomes.

# Quest: Witchy (Wo)man
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4A.name=Witchy (Wo)man
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4A.desc=If you've made the spinning wheel and done the research, you can make these.%n%nThe vis discount is very useful both to craft more efficiently and to ease your wand progression. Maybe you should look around for more discounts?

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4Q.name=Searching for Answers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4Q.desc=Last night you had a dream. A dimension, so strange and different, almost... magical? Like the saplings you found.

And no, a diamond is not enough.%n%n§3You should be able to use any vanilla flower.

# Quest: See the Unseen
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4g.name=See the Unseen
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4g.desc=Everything is made of 6 primal aspects. Those aspects can be combined to form compound aspects, but in the end, there are only 6, kinda like the infused shards you found.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA5Q.name=Infused Stones
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA5Q.desc=This whole place here is filled with magic. No matter where you look at, it's just everywhere.

They aren't super useful, but make sure to keep hold of some at least.%n%nEven when you find these infused stones, they won't drop the infused shards you desperately need. Rather, you have to process the raw ores themselves. The easiest way to do that is to throw these raw ores in your Forge Hammer.%n%nLater when you have a Sifter, you can sift purified ores for more shards. An autoclave can also turn shard dust into a shard. Maybe there's a magical way to do the same thing?

# Quest: Not For Soup
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA8Q.name=Not For Soup
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA8Q.desc=At least not for edible soup, but for essentia slurry. Get yourself a cauldron and give it a solid whack with your wand. Place some netherrack 2 blocks under the crucible and set it on fire with some flint and steel. Lastly you need to fill it with water.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAETw.name=Cursed Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAETw.desc=You can kill the powered-up monsters that spawn on the cursed earth, or just sleep and despawn them.

For example, you can place it on top of marble, but the marble cannot touch anything in the nether (netherrack, brick, etc.), and must be floating in the air.

# Quest: Warp Warnings
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG8g.name=Warp Warnings
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG8g.desc=Thaumcraft offers considerable power from its devices and tools. But power comes with a price.... That price is represented by Warp: A corruption of the character's mind and soul, inflicting progressively more dire effects upon them.%n%nWhile the effects of warp can range from annoying to deadly, accumulating enough of it can also grant you access to greater power... at the cost of increasing madness, and attention from dark powers. At least, others may call it madness... but is it truly insanity, when the voices in your head grant useful knowledge?%n%nWarp Theory adds a bunch of new Warp Effects to the Player. Be very careful because you don't want to spawn a Wither in your base.%n%n5 warp: Message%n10 warp: Fake Explosion%n15 warp: Coin, Pumpkin%n20 warp: Lay Eggs, Spawn Phantoms%n25 warp: Fake Creeper, Fake Rain%n30 warp: GregTech Fake Sounds, Spawn Bats%n35 warp: Blood, Fake Enderman%n40 warp: Spawn Friendly Creeper%n45 warp: Jump Boost, Nausea%n50 warp: Insomnia, Vis Drain, Strange Noise%n55 warp: Thunderstorm%n60 warp: Spawn Fire Bats%n65 warp: Blindness, Poison%n70 warp: Livestock Rain%n75 warp: Spawn Doppelganger%n80 warp: Spawn Endermen, Wither Potion%n85 warp: Wind%n90 warp: Ender Pearl%n95 warp: Blaze Fireball%n100 warp: Litmus Paper, Junk, Call from the Deep%n110 warp: Obsidian%n120 warp: Lightning%n125 warp: Inventory Swap%n130 warp: Random Teleport%n140 warp: Acceleration%n150 warp: Fake Wither, Inventory Scramble%n160 warp: Countdown Bomb%n170 warp: Mushrooms%n175 warp: Snow%n180 warp: Decay%n190 warp: Swamp%n200 warp: Spawn Wither

Be careful, the mobs aren't any weaker.%n%nIf you want, you can make a longer-lasting potion out of the Potion of Night Vision. Also, you should probably make them in batches of 3 so you don't waste materials.

# Quest: Source of Nickel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGTQ.name=§5§lSource of Nickel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGTQ.desc=Your Electric Blast Furnace needs Nickel. Now that you've reached the Twilight Forest, it's time to get some. The Nickel Vein that contains it is located at Y 10-40. In MV, you'll need tons of Nickel for Cupronickel, so stock up.%n%nYou can get some Cobalt out of Cobaltite through the side processes such as washing or thermal centrifuging. To electrolyze it, you'll need an MV electrolyzer though. Or you can EBF it after your EBF is done. Remember that the Sulfur Dioxide you get is based on your muffler tier. This is probably easier than searching in the Nether for Cobalt.%n%n§3You can also find small quantities of Pentlandite ore in the Overworld if you care.

# Quest: So Thirsty 
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH-g.name=So Thirsty

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHLQ.name=Ardite and Cobalt Mining

# Quest: Boots Are Made For Walking
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHzQ.name=Boots Are Made For Walking

Additionally, the goggles give you a 5 percent vis discount.%n%nSimple lens upgrades will grant you various seeing abilities as well.%n%nLater you can make more advanced goggles and even integrate the goggles into advanced armors.%n%nWith TC Node Tracker, it makes remembering nodes trivial.

# Quest: Growing Auram
betterquesting.quest.BiGj2-sBQ62nf0YtAKpGMw.name=Growing Auram
betterquesting.quest.BiGj2-sBQ62nf0YtAKpGMw.desc=One Essentia you might have a hard time gathering is Auram. Maybe you've gotten some from Ethereal Essence, which is dropped by the flying balls of light that rarely show up in the Nether, or some from Nodes. But that is hardly a good supply. The Aurelia plant can resolve this.%n%nWhen a full moon is visible overhead, Aurelia flowers will open up their petals presumably to feed off of the light. Significant for you is that they will occasionally shed these petals, which can be collected off the ground as a dense source of Auram Essentia.%n%nYou should make sure the ground near the flower is level and clear, so you'll be able to collect the petals later. The flower itself is simply planted on grass, not farmland, so no need to have a water source nearby either.%n%n[note]Terra Wart is also a growable source of Auram Essentia. It has a quest in the Fishing, Farming, Cooking quest tab.[/note]

# Quest: Comparing at a Distance
betterquesting.quest.HF-prjNuRP-RUOYzn170cQ.name=Comparing at a Distance
betterquesting.quest.HF-prjNuRP-RUOYzn170cQ.desc=Comparators are wonderfully useful devices, but their need to be directly next to whatever they are comparing is quite limiting. If you could do so remotely that would free you from one major constraint.%n%nRemote Comparators allow you to do just that. Sneak-right-click with a crystalline eye to bind the block you want to watch, and place the eye in a remote comparator to start monitoring the block remotely.%n%nGiven the extra distance, though the range of the remote comparator is quite limited, you should expect the §otiniest§r amount of signal lag compared to a direct comparator. You're doubtful that is ever going to be a limiting factor, though.

# Quest: Taint Warnings
betterquesting.quest.JyVKlIbSSiaXjYfQ2FFLhQ.name=Taint Warnings
betterquesting.quest.JyVKlIbSSiaXjYfQ2FFLhQ.desc=Now that you have started using Vis in the form of Essentia, a warning about Taint.%n%nVis in the state of Essentia is unstable if not stored properly. Left alone too long, or emptied out of the Crucible, Essentia will break down. But not into Vis. Rather, it will turn into Flux.%n%nFlux manifests as a liquid or a gas, but is, itself, only a nuisance. Thaumaturges exposed to the stuff can end up getting Flux Flue, a condition which makes it harder to channel Vis, but it is only temporary.%n%nLarger concentrations of Flux will solidify into Thaumic Slimes, bizarre creatures that try to merge with each other to grow larger. They can be dangerous, but are no less susceptible to crossbow bolts than most things.%n%nHowever, if too much flux is allowed to linger for too long, it will corrupt the land and solidify into tendrils. This is a manifestation of the blight called Taint. Fibrous Tendrils (as well as condensed blocks thereof) spread the Tainted Lands, feeding on the magic it twists. Nodes are especially vulnerable, becoming Tainted themselves if exposed to this twisted magic.%n%nDestroying the tendrils stops the spread, but unless §oall§r are destroyed this is only temporary. A more effective solution is to destroy the Tainted Land itself, as outside this specific biome tendrils quickly starve and die off.%n%nIf you are §oexceedingly§r careless with your Crucible you can, in fact, create Tainted Lands. So you would be wise to try wasting as little Essentia as possible, and clean up any you do waste.

# Quest: Growing Glowstone the Magical Way

betterquesting.quest.LUwrS4RnQGilkbdPQ_DrBg.desc=There are many plants that can provide you with Glowstone Dust. But the best one might just be Glieonia. This magical plant, once matured, can be harvested for two Glowstone Dust directly.

A total of ten of them can be put in their own dedicated inventory slot, increasing your maximum health by one heart per.%n%nIt might not be enough, but if it ends up making the difference between standing upright and standing horizontally in a box, you'll be thankful you made these things.

betterquesting.quest.UAWjHTM_SAW95_Cji-9PiA.desc=With Briar starting to consume you might also want to increase your sugar production.%n%nSweeds are planted on grass, not farmland, and will spread to propagate themselves. Once fully matured they can be harvested for sugar as well as sugar cane.

# Quest: Keeping Out the Riff-Raff
betterquesting.quest._N4B3gVMTZOoUdf9--7aPQ.name=Keeping Out the Riff-Raff
betterquesting.quest._N4B3gVMTZOoUdf9--7aPQ.desc=You're starting to get tired of having to build everything like some kind of fortress just to make sure no unwanted guests come in. Sure, that's just the nature of living in a world where infinite hoards of restless undead haunt every other dark corner, but is having a secure entryway that isn't conveniently door-shaped too much to ask?%n%nNot anymore. Paving Stone of Warding, assuming nothing sits on top of it, will project a two block tall invisible forcefield above itself that block non-player mobs from passing through, at least the common riff-raff. As a bonus spiders cannot climb the forcefield, so no need for overhangs to keep them out too.%n%nThat said, since the forcefield cannot tell an arrow fired by you from one fired §oat you§r, mundane objects will still pass through regardless. And the forcefield does as much to block line of sight as the term §oinvisible§r would suggest.%n%nOf course, you're not concerned about that part. Being able to shoot things with your crossbow while they can't reach you is very much in §oyour§r favor, all told.

# Quest: Pushing Back the Taint
betterquesting.quest.aWvML-AaSIyjyNj5ElS4VQ.name=Pushing Back the Taint
betterquesting.quest.aWvML-AaSIyjyNj5ElS4VQ.desc=So how do you actually destroy tainted land?%n%nThese Ethereal Blooms will remove Tainted Lands within a small area around themselves, which in turn kills off any Fibrous Tendrils. They cannot cleanse Tainted Nodes, nor will they necessarily return tainted biomes back to what they were before, but they will provide a barrier.%n%nThe Shimmerleaf they are made from have a recipe in an LV Assembling Machine if you're having a hard time finding them around Silverwood trees. There is also an IC2 crop version of them.

# Quest: Adding More Functions
betterquesting.quest.ad_fPxg-ThqyyuppTrG1gQ.name=Adding More Functions
betterquesting.quest.ad_fPxg-ThqyyuppTrG1gQ.desc=One such improvement is the Advanced Redcrystal.%n%nIt allows you to set a threshold with your wand to define how strong a signal needs to be in order to pass through. This can come in handy when checking fill level of tanks or power storage.%n%n[note]One caveat for redstone experts: The Advanced Redcrystal checks the signal strength in the block it is in, not in the previous block like a comparator would.[/note]

# Quest: Understanding Wand Progression
betterquesting.quest.bfrxXr1iSpGQS8iV95nJeA.name=Understanding Wand Progression
betterquesting.quest.bfrxXr1iSpGQS8iV95nJeA.desc=More advanced Thaumcraft recipes require larger and larger amounts of vis that your initial wands can't handle. You need to progress bit by bit to increase your capabilities. The progression is two-fold:%n%nFirst, you need to craft more advanced wands, the Greatwood Wand is next. And secondly, you need to improve your crafting discounts. They reduce the vis cost of crafts and thus also let you craft higher vis recipes.%n%nIn your progression you will need to rely on both aspects. Better wands and higher discounts. However, as you progress, there are many different ways on how to proceed. Some ways focus more on discounts, others more on wands. Therefore, the questbook can only give you some general advice.%n%nFor example, when making a new wand type, it is always cheapest to first make it with iron caps and then try to improve it afterwards. However, if you are able to obtain enough discounts you can directly make the wand with gold caps or better, skipping the iron capped wand.%n%nBut before all these options really open up, let us work on that Greatwood Wand!

# Quest: Essentia Storage
betterquesting.quest.cbv93MoJQESfsccTQMCwUA.name=Essentia Storage
betterquesting.quest.cbv93MoJQESfsccTQMCwUA.desc=At long last, you have all the tools to smelt items into Essentia, keep it stable, and store it for later use.%n%nThe last step was creating Warded Jars, relatively simple creations that keep Essentia in a quasi-liquid state, which makes it easier to keep Essentia from turning into Flux. Unlike phials, which must hold 8 Essentia exactly to keep it stable, Warded Jars can store anywhere from 1 to 64 Essentia.%n%nThese Warded Jars are safe to pick up and carry around, which you suspect will not be the case for most objects storing much more Essentia than these jars do. Right-click them with a label to filter that jar to a specific type of Essentia. Use a preset label if the jar is still empty.%n%nSneak-right-click with an empty hand to remove a label from a jar, or void the Essentia it contains if it doesn't have a label. Voiding Essentia from jars will not generate Flux, because... magic, I guess. It's very convenient, so just politely don't question it too much.

# Quest: Growing your own Knowledge!
betterquesting.quest.eWOxG-reT9ewlW0CNXgQNQ.name=Growing your own Knowledge!
betterquesting.quest.eWOxG-reT9ewlW0CNXgQNQ.desc=Ever thought to yourself "man, why does everything have to use primal aspects so much?" Well now you won't have to worry about that anymore!%n%nMeet the Rosa Mysteria. When the sprout planted on a Crystal Block, it will use that block's essence to grow into an Aspect Shard of the same type! These shards can then be thrown into your Cauldron or Alchemical Furnace, or used as Knowledge Fragments to gain Research Points. Even Mixed Crystals can be used as a catalyst!%n%n[warn]Warning: Planting Rosa Mysteria on Tainted Crystal Blocks will lead to unf§ko§rrs§ke§re§kn   §rco§kn§rs§ke§rq§kue§rnc§ke§r§ks.§r[/warn]

# Quest: Solid, Directional Redstone
betterquesting.quest.fmeCtrL-SNGqaLb208VSiQ.name=Solid, Directional Redstone
betterquesting.quest.fmeCtrL-SNGqaLb208VSiQ.desc=Redstone Dust is a wonderful substance, but it has several limitations that only true Minecrafters can handle.%n%nLuckily, with a bit of magic the dust crystallizes and becomes much easier to handle.%n%nRedcrystal can be placed directly against a wall or ceiling, and also allows you to use a wand to toggle whether a given side sends/receives any redstone signals. This allows for nice and compact builds in places regular redstone couldn't even exist in the first place.%n%nMaybe it is possible to improve these redcrystals further to allow them to manipulate or process the signal they're receiving in some way...

# Quest: Alleviating Warp
betterquesting.quest.gVqhKJAoTfudKA5xUWMzMg.name=Alleviating Warp
betterquesting.quest.gVqhKJAoTfudKA5xUWMzMg.desc=When you get poisoned or withered a bit of milk solves the problem. Why not create something akin to milk, but for Warp effects?%n%nBriar gives a bit of an answer to that. These two block tall plants, which require good light to grow, will produce Briar Seed Bags when harvested. Those can be combined with sugar and a suitable container in an Arcane Workbench to create Rosehip Syrup.%n%nRosehip Syrup stacks up to 16 and can be used the same as milk, also removing some (though not all) Warp effects as well as Flux Flue and Flux Phage.%n%nThe plant has a strange life cycle where the seed pods will first appear as yellow dots, turn pink as they start to mature, then §odisappear§r, only to return fully matured. Still, if it works, it works.

# Quest: Counting Items
betterquesting.quest.jvbdUzcgTfGX820wUPhxCQ.name=Counting Items
betterquesting.quest.jvbdUzcgTfGX820wUPhxCQ.desc=The Remote Comparator makes it significantly easier to get comparator signals out of whatever block you want, but looking at your storage chests you can't help but see no reason to bother. So what if they're nearly full? You want to know what they're nearly full §oof§r.%n%nTally Boxes can be pointed at a container - either directly or, using a Remote Comparator, remotely - and given a Runic Whitelist that specifies conditions where you want a Tally Box to send a redstone signal. Quantity, metadata and NBT matching are options, as is using a basic name filter.%n%nNote that the redstone side is always opposite the reading side, and Remote Comparators must be placed on top of Tally Boxes to work together, meaning redstone is always output on the down face in that case.%n%n[note]Runic Whitelists don't let you use NEI ghost items to set their filters, unfortunately.[/note]

# Quest: Tube Madness
betterquesting.quest.xoH_knd-RV-22QEfLUtuDA.name=Tube Madness
betterquesting.quest.xoH_knd-RV-22QEfLUtuDA.desc=So you want to move essentia from your Alchemical furnace to your warded Jars without getting it all gunked up with different essentia types?%n%nWell you came to the right place, with the use of buffered tubes and your handy wand you can move your essentia in tubes to fill all your jars without having to manually break and replace one jar at a time.%n%nTo create a simple setup place the buffered tubes in a main line from your Arcane Alembic with tubes coming out of the main buffered tube line. These standard tubes will then go directly into a warded jar. To get the essentia to flow correctly into the buffered tubes, shift-right-click the output side of the buffered tube with your wand until it is red. This will change the band to a red band which will limit the suction of the Essentia.%n%nThe Essentia will be forced from the buffered tube to a normal tube then into your Warded jars. Chain your buffered tubes as needed until all your Warded Jars will fit.%n§4%nNote: This system will get gunked up with essentia if any of your Warded Jars are full!%n%n§rIf you would like more information please check out the guide 'A Thaumaturge Guide to Laying Pipe' by xlstadal for more indepth Thaumcraft 4 Tube knowledge.%n%n§9§n[url]https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fMvJ5HbeOdy4UgBMe47cggis02idxWoMDgK81SgowEo[/url]§r

# Quest: Infinite Durability
betterquesting.quest.yT18iStZRzKem7FYnZoRzw.name=Infinite Durability
betterquesting.quest.yT18iStZRzKem7FYnZoRzw.desc=Pipe some liquid Instrumentum into this bad boy and you can repair anything with Vanilla durability!%n%n§b§3[note]Doesn't work on Blood Magic potions, TiC tools, GT tools and tools with charge. Every point of Instrumentum equals eight points of durability.[/note]


## Quest Line: Adept Thaumaturgy
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFw.name=Adept Thaumaturgy
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFw.desc=Warp included.

# Quest: Adept Thaumaturgy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBA.name=Adept Thaumaturgy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBA.desc=I have mastered the basics. Master warned me about forbidden magic, but it sounds so promising. I think a bit of the forbidden can't hurt...

# Quest: An Awesome Magic Conductor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBQ.name=An Awesome Magic Conductor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBQ.desc=More... I want MOOORE! There must be something even stronger than the hydra. Something older, more ancient.%n%nThese tears, WOW! I've never felt something so strong. Could it be? Could I make an even more powerful wand with these?

# Quest: A Silverwood Wand at Last
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBw.name=A Silverwood Wand at Last
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBw.desc=I tried to combine the lich bones I had with a silverwood rod. The result: A pile of ashes. It crumbled to dust within seconds. I need a better conductor. The hydra in the Twilight Forest has the ability to regrow an entire head! Her blood must contain a large amount of magic. I guess I need a bit of that to finally complete my silverwood wand.

# Quest: Creating a Better Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCQ.name=Creating a Better Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCQ.desc=This greatwood wand is nice, but it can only store 50 vis. Not enough to move nodes. My attempts to use silverwood failed, but I've come across other mundane materials that I could use to make a new wand core.

# Quest: More Energetic Screws to Finish the New Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCg.name=More Energetic Screws to Finish the New Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCg.desc=Those stainless steel screws don't work on these rods. Due to the huge amounts of vis those wands can carry, the screws somehow "melt" away. I need a material that can handle these energies. I should try energetic alloy next.%n%n§3If you are struggling to make the next wand in this step or one of the next, you should try to get more discount on your gear.%n%nAlso look at the various caps, the better ones are more expensive to craft but give discounts or other benefits. In many situations you might need to start with cheap ones and only make the better caps later.%n%nYou can also improve your wand with augmentations.

# Quest: Best Wand Caps Ever...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEA.name=Best Wand Caps Ever...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEA.desc=Of course! Thaumium! What could conduct vis better than... a magical metal?

# Quest: She Let Go
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQ.name=She Let Go
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQ.desc=This blood seems pretty common, but she had advanced magic abilities. I'm sure I can use this as a medium.

# Quest: Reactor Material
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEg.name=Reactor Material
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEg.desc=This stuff is interesting... Maybe I can use it as a wand conductor?

# Quest: Centi-vis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEw.name=Centi-vis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEw.desc=Many advanced machines require vis in order to do what they're supposed to. But using a wand as some sort of battery to transfer vis from a node to your machine didn't work as expected. What if you could rip open a portal to another dimension and siphon power out of it using a node? Nothing could §opossibly§r go wrong with that, right?

# Quest: Bring it Home
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABFA.name=Bring it Home
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABFA.desc=You probably have a nice collection of bookmarked nodes. But running around to recharge your wand(s) isn't really the way an adept thaumaturge should get his required vis. Moving nodes is not that hard, but without doubt, you need something to protect them from each other.

# Quest: Automated Wand Recharging
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABFQ.name=Automated Wand Recharging
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABFQ.desc=So you've found a way to gather nodes now. What about automated wand recharging? Wouldn't that be extremely convenient?

# Quest: Centi-vis Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABFg.name=Centi-vis Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABFg.desc=You totally should get yourself some centi-vis things to transport and use the vis from stabilized nodes.

# Quest: The Dark Realm
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABFw.name=The Dark Realm
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABFw.desc=We found the way... my precious. We found it! Only need 4 tasty eyes, and some magic to open the door. The secret door, they didn't see it. Hehehe! All the time. It was there... Aaaall the time!

# Quest: They See Me, They Watch Me
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABGA.name=They See Me, They Watch Me
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABGA.desc=Eyes. Yes. Eyes! I need eyes, my precious. Not spidery ones, no. Nasty hairy things. Don't taste good. Eldritch eyes! I will rip those from their bodies.

# Quest: Really (Really!) Dark Magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABGQ.name=Really (Really!) Dark Magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABGQ.desc=Fools. FOOLS I say! They know nothing! This book will guide me, yes. Yes it will, my precious. It will lead us to even more POWER!%n%nAvailable in your local bookstore, and also occasionally found on Crimson Knights and Crimson Clerics.

# Quest: Secrets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABGg.name=Secrets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABGg.desc=I can feel it. Yess. Yeeeess. We will gain more power nigh. Nigh! Yes. My precious. The voices gave me a hint, there is a dimension filled with unbelievable sources of magic energy. I must go there. I must! The crimson people know the secret. I will rip them aparrrt... They will tell me!%n%n§3NOTE: You might want to set up a spawner because you'll likely need to kill a lot of these guys for the book you need for the next task. Additionally, they're spawned by the Clerics, which DO NOT RESPAWN.

# Quest: Find the Key
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABGw.name=Find the Key
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABGw.desc=No, nooo! They have hidden it! Must find the keeey. Must find it! We need the tablet to open the door my precious.

# Quest: The Power of Creation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHA.name=The Power of Creation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHA.desc=What... What am I doing here? Where am I?! What is this place?! Oh those headaches... (It seems that the pulsating pearl you just found cured your brain from... something. Something old, probably some kind of trap to keep away unworthy ones.)%n%n§3/iskamiunlocked will tell you if you have successfully unlocked Kami. If not, try researching the Thaumium Crowbar and the Cursed Spirits Blade. Or other stuff on the vanilla pages. Or in TT. It's not really reliable anymore with all the mods and such.

# Quest: Concentrated Darkness
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHQ.name=Concentrated Darkness
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHQ.desc=For some reason, you decided to infuse darkness into a seed. It appeared to be promising. For what? You don't know...%n%n§3For the Eldritch research you need to be > 30 for the first, and > 50 for the second. Temporary warp won't work, however.

# Quest: "Armor"
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHg.name="Armor"
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHg.desc=This new metal, it's so... appealing. You feel comfortable while holding it, so why not get yourself some armor? What could go wrong? It will surely protect you.

# Quest: What Could Possibly Go Wrong?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHw.name=What Could Possibly Go Wrong?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHw.desc=256 essentia in one block! Now that is what I call storage. Does make weird sounds, but I guess it's nothing special...

# Quest: Let's Try This
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIA.name=Let's Try This
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIA.desc=Mortals. Pah. What do they know about REAL power? The voices tell me I need to focus on Alienis and Tenebrae if I want to advance. So what about food?

# Quest: Little Helpers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIw.name=Little Helpers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIw.desc=A state of the art thaumaturge doesn't do menial work anymore. He has little helpers instead. Golems can and will do all the things for you, just as you command them.

# Quest: Slightly Better
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABJA.name=Slightly Better
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABJA.desc=Wood is somewhat better than straw. They are still to be considered weak, but an ideal little cutie for farms.

# Quest: Sticks and Stones...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABJQ.name=Sticks and Stones...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABJQ.desc=...will break your bones! These guys are hard as rock (Insert audience laugh here) and will protect your claim as good as possible.

# Quest: The Best of All?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABJg.name=The Best of All?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABJg.desc=Highly durable, can carry a lot of items and is considered the "top tier" golem. But you are sure there is more...%n%nYou'll need to chisel a thaumium block to get the right kind you need for the golem.

# Quest: Essentia Item Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABJw.name=Essentia Item Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABJw.desc=Sure, you could just go with gazillions of jars, but it's way more convenient to store essentia in a chest or barrel. Isn't it?

# Quest: The Basic Elements
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABKA.name=The Basic Elements
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABKA.desc=Of course you know where and how to get the basic essentia types. Right?

# Quest: Magical Item Teleportation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABKQ.name=Magical Item Teleportation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABKQ.desc=It's annoying to do, but you can teleport items with this. Check the thaumonomicon for details.

# Quest: (Almost) Automated Essentia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABKg.name=(Almost) Automated Essentia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABKg.desc=By combining the essentia locus, the essentia mirror and an essentia aggregator, you are now able to transmit essentia from almost anywhere. Fancy essentia-storage facility incoming!

# Quest: Essentia Monitoring
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABKw.name=Essentia Monitoring
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABKw.desc=Manually checking your jars can be tedious, especially if you want to infuse a bunch of stuff at once. Luckily, the essentia locus can help you with that, as it monitors all jars that have been targeted with a crystalline eye.

# Quest: Cleaning the Goo
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABLA.name=Cleaning the Goo
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABLA.desc=As you do more and more infusions, you're getting tired of removing all the flux that's generated. The Shovel of the Purifier will help you clean up flux, and is a must-have.%n%n§3Actually this is pretty useless, if you have any concept of what you're doing.

# Quest: One Does Not Simply...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABLQ.name=One Does Not Simply...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABLQ.desc=...play with magic. Be warned, these fires are very dangerous! But who doesn't want a patch of snow in the nether?%n%nFire spread is disabled in the configs of servers to prevent massive lag and world destruction.

# Quest: Pushing the Limits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABLw.name=Pushing the Limits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABLw.desc=Regular enchantments have a limit, like III for Fortune. Utilizing magic, you should be able to bypass that limitation, at least a tiny bit; Eventually creating enchantments like Fortune IV. It comes with limitations, but your book shall tell you more about those.

# Quest: Enchanting Like a Pro
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMA.name=Enchanting Like a Pro
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMA.desc=Finally, a device where you can actually choose which enchantments you want to have. Powered by vis, it can create the most powerful combinations one could imagine.

# Quest: Crying Obsidian...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMQ.name=Crying Obsidian...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMQ.desc=...it mourns the dead. This might come in handy for some cases. By placing 2 on top of each other, you're able to set your respawn point to that location, without the need for a bed. It's up to you to imagine the possibilities...

# Quest: Useful Trees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMg.name=Useful Trees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMg.desc=Just like plants, there are trees that will attract various friendly and "not so friendly" creatures. (No warranty when placed in desolated biome!)

# Quest: Purge Your Warp
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADQQ.name=Purge Your Warp
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADQQ.desc=The warp you have accumulated over time is starting to become a problem. Making bath salts to clean off the warp is only a temporary solution. To truly get rid of it, you need something more powerful, a pure tear. If you collect a few things for me, I will give you one. Think wisely about using it, since it's a very long journey to unlock it through research.%n%n§3PS: You need an LuV-powered EBF for the osmiridium.

# Quest: Magic Staff Core
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADbg.name=Magic Staff Core
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADbg.desc=A staff requires an extra step for crafting: Two (matching) wand cores must be combined with a primal charm, and crystal clusters to produce a staff core. (While the recipes are all similar, each type of staff core requires a separate research topic to be learned.) 

# Quest: A Wizard's Staff Has a Knob on the End
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADdw.name=A Wizard's Staff Has a Knob on the End
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADdw.desc=Join the core with two wand caps, a twilight forest mob drop, and screws just as for making a wand. A staff cannot be used for crafting, but holds 2.5x as much vis as a corresponding wand. It can even serve as a backup weapon for melee. While it cannot receive weapon enchantments, its damage is decent, and it does not take damage with use (no durability bar).

# Quest: Did You Want to Know Your Warp Level?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEHw.name=Did You Want to Know Your Warp Level?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEHw.desc=After a few forbidden researches your warp level has increased a bit. Do you want to know how much warp you have?%n%nCraft some litmus paper to print out the warp level.

# Quest: Bathing the Warp Effects Away
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAESQ.name=Bathing the Warp Effects Away
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAESQ.desc=Litmus paper will tell you how high your warp level is, but how can you get rid of the nasty warp effects? Bath salt will help you by prohibiting warp effects for a short period. Just throw the salt into a 1x1 water hole and jump inside. You will feel relieved a bit after bathing.

# Quest: Bathing in a Spa. Automated Warp Removal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAESg.name=Bathing in a Spa. Automated Warp Removal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAESg.desc=Bathing in a spa will automate the process of temporarily removing warp effects. Take the bath salt with you into the spa.

# Quest: Temp Warp Remover Soap
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAESw.name=Temp Warp Remover Soap
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAESw.desc=This soap is very special. It will remove temporary warp and has a small chance to also remove some normal warp, if you are lucky. Taking a bath first increases your chances.%n%nHint: You need to chisel your tallow block for the recipe to work.

# Quest: Beacon
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAETg.name=Beacon
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAETg.desc=With your ascension to adept thaumaturge you are ready to fusion craft beacons. The beacon recipe is found on the GTNH Thaumcraft Page. Activate it in your base to gain various positive effects.

# Quest: Stable Division Sigil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEUQ.name=Stable Division Sigil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEUQ.desc=The second ritual will not be as easy as the first one. After this ritual your sigil will be stable enough to make stable unstable ingots which will not explode, and will no longer take durability damage.%n%nThis ritual needs to be performed in The End dimension. The ritual is performed by placing a Beacon in the center of a flat area of at least 11x11, not necessarily End Stone. Then place a chest in each of the cardinal directions leaving 4 spaces empty between the chest and the Beacon. In each chest insert these specific contents:%n%nNorth: iron ingot, gold ingot and the other things listed in the task.%nSouth: The different Ore Blocks and the other things listed in the task.%nEast: The potions.%nWest: The Music disks.%n%nA spiral pattern of Redstone and String is then laid out around the beacon. At any time, shift-right-clicking the Beacon with an Activated Division Sigil in hand will show the building progress of the ritual.%n%nFinally, kill an Iron Golem while it stands within the ritual area to activate the process. If it works, there will be an explosion that destroys the beacon and chests, while every Enderman in the End vanishes. During the ritual, throngs of aggressive mobs imbued with Haste will begin spawning and attacking the Player who needs to kill 100 of them to complete the ritual. If the Player dies or leaves the dimension, the ritual will fail and will have to be started over. Once enough mobs have been killed, the first activated Sigil in the inventory will stabilize. The Pseudo-Inversion Sigil can be used an unlimited number of times, and dividing an Iron Ingot by Diamond will produce Mobius "Unstable-Stable" Ingot which does not explode, can be produced in any crafting interface and will stack up to 64.

# Quest: Magic "Staffter"
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEpw.name=Magic "Staffter"
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEpw.desc=It is also possible to create a bizarre hybrid of staff and scepter (sometimes called a "staffter"), by using a staff core instead of a wand core in the scepter recipe. The resulting device can neither hold a focus nor be placed in a crafting table, but it can still be used to activate constructs, or as a "vis battery" for Repair-enchanted equipment or Runic shielding.

# Quest: Pimp Your Wand Focus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFZg.name=Pimp Your Wand Focus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFZg.desc=The Manipulator requires both XP levels and centi-vis in order to upgrade foci. Each Focus can be upgraded a total of five times, with the level and vis cost increasing by 8 for each upgrade. Some upgrades can be applied only at certain levels (often only at level 3), and others have prerequisite upgrades. Some upgrades like Frugal and Potency can be applied multiple times. All upgrades are permanent, and there is currently no way to remove them.

# Quest: Advanced Node Stabilizer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFZw.name=Advanced Node Stabilizer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFZw.desc=The advanced node stabilizer acts like a normal node stabilizer but with key differences. It will still stop the node it affects from being drained but the node can still drain from other, lesser nodes. It also has a higher chance to improve fading and unstable nodes. The downside is that any nodes it affects will have their recharge rates effectively reduced to nothing. They will recharge at an extremely reduced rate.

# Quest: Infuse Your Focus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFeQ.name=Infuse Your Focus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFeQ.desc=Try to add Potency to your Shock Focus. At Level 3 you can add Chain Lightning or Shock Wave.

# Quest: A Travel Companion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI2w.name=A Travel Companion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI2w.desc=Lonely? The Traveling Trunk is a simple companion, giving you some extra space. With upgrades (one per trunk) it can offer you some nice advantages. Like other golems, you can pick it up with the Golemancer's Bell. Its brain is pretty small though, so it can easily get stuck. You can order it to stay in one spot via the GUI. It will attempt to teleport to you, as long as the chunk is still loaded. It can also follow you into different dimensions.%n%nThey will heal slowly on their own, or faster if you right-click on them with any food, including rotten meat.

You scoff at the claim, but apparently if you "Open the Eye" and create a very fancy carved stone, you can create a portal there. But this eye it speaks of...just what is it?

Why, where have your Riches gone? The sole inhabitant tells you that all such things have faded away long ago, with the End of Time at hand...But that simply means you're in the right PLACE after all! You're simply in the wrong TIME. If you simply adjust the portal a little, you can arrive at the right PLACE and TIME to get your well-deserved Riches. You suspect that such an adjustment would require something strong...INFINITELY strong.%n%nIn the meantime you now have a very very big closet to store your things in once the old owner...moves out. Upon leaving, you spot a tiny Ghast, surely just your imagination? Unfortunately the shifting of time causes you to end up in what is likely wilderness when you leave. (Exiting through the portal sends you back to the world spawn)%n%nIn order to build a machine to take you to both the right place and time, you're going to have to roll up your sleeves and get to the very limits of technological prowess you can imagine. (see the Endgame Goals tab when you're ready)

It also has a nice ability that makes it easier to charge.%n%nAt last, the thaumium core creates a wand with a slightly higher capacity. But it is also more expensive to craft than the others. Depending on your discounts you might not be able to get it immediately and have to go for one of the other options first.%n%n§3You only need to do one of the tasks.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMlA.name=The roots of magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMlA.desc=If you're familiar with Botania, you will notice that the overworld is noticeably void of magical flowers and mushrooms. Such pretty expressions of magic sadly require you to have leveled up on your magical skills. For now you will have to make do with what the world has to offer.%n%nLook in deep caves in the Twilight Forest at low Y-levels for glimmering mushrooms. These are your starting ingredient and can be used instead of flower petals. Beware, unlike flowers you can't grow more just yet, so be careful what you use them for.

# Quest: Flower grafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMlQ.name=Flower grafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMlQ.desc=The first item you want to make is the Petal Apothecary.

# Quest: Mana diamonds
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMmg.name=Mana diamonds
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMmg.desc=Mana diamonds are magically enhanced diamonds, and they require more or less energy depending on the quality of the gem you're trying to enchant.%n%nA completely full diluted pool is barely able to make a mana diamond out of an exquisite diamond. Once you upgrade the pool you can use regular diamonds - be it at a higher mana cost.

# Quest: A glimpse into a watery future
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMmw.name=A glimpse into a watery future
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMmw.desc=The next step is to make some catalysts.

# Quest: Botanic infusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMnA.name=Botanic infusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMnA.desc=The infusion altar will allow you to make runes, which in turn gives you access to progressively more advanced flowers.%n%nTo operate the altar, drop the ingredients on top, whack it with a wand of the forest, and when it's done drop a livingrock block on top to complete the craft.

# Quest: A deal with Alfar Industries
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMoA.name=A deal with Alfar Industries
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMoA.desc=So the rumors about the elves are true. Well, §owere§r true. Some are still true. And what isn't true used to be true.%n%nTurns out they have since been talking to a mysterious individual they call the §oDream Master§r. Apparently that sparked an industrial revolution among the Alfar.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMrg.desc=Craft some runes, because why not?

# Quest: What are all these flowers even for?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtA.name=What are all these flowers even for?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtA.desc=If you've never used Botania before, you may be wondering about the purpose of all this effort. This isn't a simple question to answer, but one thing you can do that's quite useful right now is making yourself some manasteel.%n%nAmong its many uses, manasteel has one of the best, if not simply §othe§o §rbest, durabilities of materials available at LV, so it's perfect for all of your crafting tools.%n%nIf you have a particular dislike of Tinker's Construct, manasteel is a great material to make a Gregtech pickaxe out of too.

# Quest: Moron's Manual for Mana Manufacture And Manipulation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtQ.name=Moron's Manual for Mana Manufacture And Manipulation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtQ.desc=To use the power of magical flowers, you must understand how to generate and manipulate mana. This ethereal blue-ish substance is produced by generating flowers, when their requirements are met. Mana is not easily quantified, so you will have to do a lot of estimating if you want to use it efficiently.%n%nOnce you have chosen which flower you want to use to generate mana, you must plant it near a mana spreader. When the flower's conditions are fulfilled, it will begin to produce mana, and store it in the internal buffer of the nearest mana spreader. The mana spreader itself will automatically emit any mana it contains, provided it is aimed at a valid destination (such as a mana pool). You'll need a lot of these devices, so craft a pair for now.%n%nMana spreaders will aim towards you when you place them down. To change their direction, use a wand of the forest: while holding the wand, shift-right-click on the mana spreader, and then shift-right-click on the block you want it to aim at. This method of binding also works for other things, such as binding a flower to a specific mana spreader.

# Quest: Solar Power: Floral Edition
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtg.name=Solar Power: Floral Edition
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtg.desc=The daybloom is an extremely simple generating flower. All you have to do is place it down, and it'll produce mana for free during the day. The downside of this arrangement is that dayblooms die after only an hour.%n%nYou can find Goldenrod flowers in Prairie biomes.%n%nMake one, and I'll give you another.

# Quest: Hydrobotanic Energy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtw.name=Hydrobotanic Energy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtw.desc=Mana is blue. Water is also blue. There's a correlation there, and the hydroangea turns that correlation into causation. Place a water source block nearby, and the hydroangea will consume it to produce mana - until it dies after an hour.%n%nThis one can be a bit tricky to automate given the lack of naturally-regenerating source blocks.

# Quest: Dark Energy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMuA.name=Dark Energy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMuA.desc=Perhaps not the kind of "dark energy" you're familiar with, the nightshade produces mana at night. Like other passive generating flowers, it dies after an hour.

# Quest: Is this a combustion generator?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMuQ.name=Is this a combustion generator?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMuQ.desc=The endoflame burns combustible materials in order to produce mana. It can efficiently consume fuels with a burn time of up to 64000 per item (equivalent to four blocks of coal); any burn time beyond this will be wasted. Endoflames don't die like passive flowers do, and are simple to use, so it's a good idea to make several of them.

# Quest: A Botanist's Best Friend
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMug.name=A Botanist's Best Friend
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMug.desc=Functional flowers are a large part of Botania. Most of them have nuances to how they operate, and these are generally best explained in the Lexica Botania: a codex of all Botania knowledge. This questline will explain the basics, but be sure to keep a copy of the Lexica Botania on hand so you can easily reference the details.%n%nBesides being a repository of useful information, the Lexica Botania has another function: if, while holding it, you look at any Botania block in the world, you can shift-right-click on that block to open up the relevant page.%n%nSomething else you'll want for functional flowers is a handful of redstone roots. Flowers which have a redstone root in their recipe have the ability to toggle whether they are active by applying a redstone signal. Make a few before you move on.

# Quest: Anti-Magnetism
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMuw.name=Anti-Magnetism
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMuw.desc=If you've made a ring of magnetization, you may be getting tired of having to take it off around various Botania systems that require items to be on the ground in order to interact with flowers. The solegnolia is your solution to that. Simply place one down anywhere you don't want items to be automatically put in your inventory, and the ring of magnetization will be disabled while you're in the vicinity of the solegnolia. It doesn't even require mana!

# Quest: Violence Is Blue
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvA.name=Violence Is Blue
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvA.desc=The dreadthorne is similar to the bellethorne, but it only kills adult animals. This is helpful for farming livestock, though it's only one aspect of a successful farm.

# Quest: Roses Are Blood-Red
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvQ.name=Roses Are Blood-Red
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvQ.desc=The bellethorne is a delightful little flower with an [warn]insatiable thirst for blood[/warn], though fortunately your blood doesn't count. When provided with a supply of mana, it will inflict damage on any living entities near it, with the exception of players. It's a good extra layer of defense to place at the entrances to your early-game bamboo fortress.

# Quest: Magic Blue Dust
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvg.name=Magic Blue Dust
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvg.desc=You'll need mana powder to proceed. Make four to start out with.

# Quest: Better Generating Flowers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvw.name=Better Generating Flowers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvw.desc=If you want anything better than an endoflame, you'll need a runic altar. Fortunately, most runes are easily crafted as soon as you can make the runic altar. Sinful runes, however, require titanium to make. For now, just make one of each of the elemental runes; that'll be enough to get you started.

# Quest: Shut down your canning machine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwA.name=Shut down your canning machine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwA.desc=Some flowers eat bees. Some eat leaves. Some eat slimes. This one eats everything (everything you can eat, anyway). The gourmaryllis is happiest when provided with a good variety of delicious meals, so I hope the HV-tier diet of canned sludge hasn't made you forget how to cook.

# Quest: Experienced Botanist
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwQ.name=Experienced Botanist
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwQ.desc=The rosa arcana transmutes experience into mana. A player standing near it will have their experience drained for this purpose. This process is unfortunately not very practical to automate, as the experience can only be extracted directly from a player, and not from orbs on the ground or any method of storage. It might be wise to place it somewhere you spend a lot of time.

# Quest: Mmmmmm, Slimy!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwg.name=Mmmmmm, Slimy!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwg.desc=Have you ever seen a slime and thought "I'd love to eat that"? The narslimmus has.%n%nIt needs to be planted somewhere slimes can naturally appear, but if you can find a good place for a narslimmus it'll consume those slimes and give you a good amount of mana in return.

# Quest: Flower!!! Unlimited Flower!!!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMww.name=Flower!!! Unlimited Flower!!!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMww.desc=The jaded amaranthus causes mystical flowers to grow all around it. Their vibrant petals can be used for magic, so you no longer have to go foraging for mushrooms.%n%nThere §ois§o§o§r another way of getting these, but you'll have to figure that one out for yourself.

# Quest: Obligatory Lava Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMxA.name=Obligatory Lava Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMxA.desc=The thermalily consumes lava, but it's not quite as simple as just constantly replenishing a lava pool. There's a cooldown that you'll have to account for. Even so, it's a fairly easy flower to automate if you have a good lava source.

# Quest: Chickenization
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMxQ.name=Chickenization
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMxQ.desc=The soarleander generates mana by consuming anything chicken-related, including entire chickens.

# Quest: According to all known laws of mana generation...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMxg.name=According to all known laws of mana generation...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMxg.desc=...there is no way a bee should be able to produce mana. The beegonia doesn't know this, and will gladly eat up all of your spare drones to help with filling your mana pools.

betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGw.desc=Granny Weatherwax would approve.

# Quest: Fire Burn and...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABTA.name=Fire Burn and...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABTA.desc=In order to get started with your basic witchery needs, you need a Witches Oven.%n%nThe Witches Oven is used to get the most basic ingredients for your recipes - Fumes.%n%nThe oven is able to capture the by-products produced in the cooking process. Activating the oven to show the interface screen, you will see an additional slot to the right of the fuel slot. Clay jars must be placed in this slot. If there are clay jars present when something is cooked, there is a chance a by-product will be captured in one of the jars. These by-products are important ingredients in other recipes. If there are no clay jars in the oven when something is cooked, no by-products will be produced.%n%nUpgrading an Oven%n%nAn oven can be upgraded by placing either a Fume Funnel or a Filtered Fume Funnel to the left and right of it. Each Fume Funnel will increase the cooking speed by an additional 10 percent (over a furnace) and increase the chance of a by-product being produced by an additional 25 percent for a Fume Funnel or 30 percent for a Filtered Fume Funnel.%n%nA fully upgraded oven will therefore cook at 130 percent speed (compared to a furnace) and have a 90 percent chance of producing a by-product.

# Quest: Offerings
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABTQ.name=Offerings
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABTQ.desc=For all your offering needs. And of course, it looks fancy!%n%nAn altar is created by placing six altar blocks in a 2x3 pattern; you will know it's correct when a red cloth appears over the top of the altar.%n%nRight-clicking on it will bring up a screen showing how much power the altar has collected, how much it can collect and its current recharge rate. It is important to check that there is sufficient available power to perform a given rite or use a distillery, or certain kettle or cauldron recipes.%n%nThe maximum amount of power available is determined by how many natural items are in the vicinity of the altar: dirt, grass, trees, plants, etc. all contribute; stone and sand do not. The important thing is to have a diverse mix of different plants, trees and crops (plants from other mods are supported to an extent as well).%n%nCertain objects (or foci) placed on the altar boost its focusing capabilities. This can increase the rate at which the altar replenishes focus, the focus capacity, and the focus range. Only one of each type of item (skull, chalice, etc.) has an effect. There may also be other less savory foci that dark magic practitioners could make use of.

# Quest: ...Cauldron Bubble
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABTg.name=...Cauldron Bubble
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABTg.desc=The second thing you'll need is a cauldron. It is used to craft most of the basic items, like mutandis. It requires anointing paste, which you will need an MV mixer to make. It is made by placing a regular Cauldron in the world, and then using Anointing Paste on it.%n%nTo brew a potion, cast a ritual or create an item, the cauldron must first be filled with water. This can be achieved by using three buckets of water on it, pumping water into it using pipes, or by using a Dispenser containing a Brew of Endless Water.%n%nOnce a cauldron is full of water, it must boil. Lighting a fire beneath the cauldron is the only way for this to happen. Using a netherrack block will guarantee the fire does not go out, although if it does go out, it may be set to boil again without any consequences (unlike brewing in a Kettle!).%n%nWhen the water is boiling, ingredients may be added to the Cauldron (one after another), to create the desired effect. The book, Witches' Brews gives a complete overview of all ingredients and what they can do when added to a brew.

# Quest: Don't Touch the Needle!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABTw.name=Don't Touch the Needle!

# Quest: Probably Usable For Soup
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABUA.name=Probably Usable For Soup
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABUA.desc=But its main purpose is to brew potions and infusions.%n%nA kettle must be set up in the correct way before it can be used.%n%nFirstly, a fire must be set under the kettle (netherrack is best for this, but wood will do just as well).%n%nNext the kettle must be filled. You can use pipes to automate this.%n%nThirdly, each of the six ingredients for the brew or infusion must be thrown into the kettle, one at a time (the liquid will change color according to the recipe being used).%n%nFinally, a glass bottle must be used on the kettle to bottle the resulting brew, this must be done multiple times depending on the recipe.%n%nIt is important to keep the fire going constantly while the recipe is being prepared, otherwise it will be ruined. Swirls coming from the kettle is a sign all is well, black smoke (and brown liquid) indicates the brew is ruined. When a brew is ruined, the kettle must be emptied with a glass bottle, or just filled with more water, and the whole process repeated.%n%nWhen a brew is complete, the liquid will be the color of the resulting brew and will splutter (in addition to white swirls).%n%nSome recipes will require magical energy from a nearby Altar before they are bottled. If the brew is bottled when insufficient energy is available, the brew will be ruined. Black swirls coming from the Kettle is a good sign there is not enough power. A kettle must be within 14 (to 16) blocks of an Altar in order to obtain power from it (it can obtain power only from a single altar).

# Quest: Don't Shake it Too Much
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABUQ.name=Don't Shake it Too Much

These have been known to include the souls of demons that can be consumed to allow a witch to cast demonic spells.%n%nA very well treated Flame Imp may even yield knowledge to summon a Lord of Torment.

# Quest: Lord of Torment
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJLA.name=Lord of Torment
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJLA.desc=A Lord of Torment is a mighty demonic being that is able to create prisons to Torment its victims.%n%nThose foolish enough to summon one of these creatures must prepare for an arduous fight.%n%nA Lord of Torment may only be summoned using the Ritual outlined in a Torment Scroll.%nThese scrolls are hard to come by, but it is rumored that well treated Flame Imps have occasionally given them up.%n%nConsuming the Soul of a Torment Demon grants the ability to Torment others.%n%nIf you are very unlucky and the Lord of Torment disappears when entering the Torment dimension, use the Egg and spawn another one.

# Quest: Mutating Sprig
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJUw.name=Mutating Sprig
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJUw.desc=The Mutating Sprig brings a degree of order to the chaotic nature of Mutandis, allowing more limited, but also more predictable effects. It is a key tool in the creation of plant-based devices such as the Leech Chest.%n%nThe Mutating Sprig is crafted in the crafting bench using an Ent Twig, Nether Wart and Mutandis Extremis.%n%nGrass - Mutates to Mycellium%nMycellium - Mutates to Grass%nDirt (under water) - Mutates to Clay%n%nWheat in a proper configuration should mutate to wormwood, but because of other mods it doesn't work. You can buy wormwood from the Coins tab instead.

# Quest: Changing Biomes With Witchery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcQ.name=Changing Biomes With Witchery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcQ.desc=There are two ways to change biomes with Witchery, the easy way or the hard way, choose which one you want to do (or do them both). Remember that you need a Witchery Distillery first!

# Quest: The Easy Way to Change Biomes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcg.name=The Easy Way to Change Biomes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcg.desc=So you want the easy way? Ok, go get this stuff:%nMandrake Root, Nether Wart, Tear of the Goddess, Diamond Vapor, and a Diamond.%n%nThen toss it in the Witch's Cauldron IN THAT ORDER, before also tossing in a page from the Book of Biomes (Extended) (craft it with a piece of paper while on the page of the biome you want), followed by a bit of Gunpowder.%nThen just use a bottle to get the brew. If wearing your Robes or Hat, you may even get more than one! You may get even more if you have a ton of brewing expertise.%n%nIf it failed, you may not have enough Altar Power: you need 5450 at least. Try placing down a Dragon Egg or Demon Heart if you're close. For more details on altar power, check the wiki page here [url]https://ftbwiki.org/Altar[/url].%n%nIf you want to have more than a single changed block, then add Glowstone Dust, Blaze Rod and Attuned Stone (Charged) in that order to increase the effect (and Altar Power cost slightly) by +1 for each. Do this before adding in the page.%n%nFor more detailed info, check out the Witches' Brews book. Click on Brewing, then go to the Brews: Step-by-step page. This should tell you what you need to know. For what each of the brews actually does, see the Effects page. Only Effects use Capacity, and you can have multiple.

# Quest: The Hard Way to Change Biomes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcw.name=The Hard Way to Change Biomes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcw.desc=Ok, to have a ritual with a size greater than zero, you need to get Coven Witches to acknowledge you and then agree to help you out. To get them to deign to speak with you, you can either infuse yourself or bind a familiar. In this quest line we'll be covering binding a familiar, but for the people who want to do infusion, you just need to make the appropriate item: Ghost of the Light, Soul of the World, Spirit of Otherwhere, or Infernal Animus, and do the appropriate Rite of Infusion. Be sure to have a Death Protection Poppet to protect you, because the ritual kills you. If playing hardcore, definitely test in a separate world first.%n%nTo bind a familiar, first summon a Demon and tear out its heart. No, seriously, go do it. Use an Arthana with Looting III for the best chances. If you don't know how to summon one, refer to page 49/50 of the Circle Magic book for the correct Rite of Summoning.%n%nYou'll need a Mutating Sprig for the next part.

# Quest: More Hearts for Valentines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdA.name=More Hearts for Valentines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdA.desc=If you want to get more hearts, you can try trading with the Demon, but they're more likely to shoot fireballs at you than trade. Unless you have this item that is! First, make the Polynesia Charm that allows you to trade with animals (probably not worth it in this pack), then use the demon heart to make the Devil's Tongue Charm. With this, not only are they a lot less likely to attack, they will even sell their brethren's hearts for a little less.%n%nJust remember that it can only be used a limited number of times, ok? It might also be worthwhile to use the Rite of Protection at the same time as summoning a demon. To do so just put down both circles, and meet the item (and Altar Power) requirements of both. If you're not planning on killing the demon, you should probably send it back when you're done with the Rite of Banishing on page 47/48 of the Circle Magic book.

# Quest: Are You Grassping What I'm Telling You?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdQ.name=Are You Grassping What I'm Telling You?

# Quest: PETA Approved*
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdg.name=PETA Approved*
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdg.desc=To make Critter Snares, first you need to arrange Alder Saplings in the cardinal directions around a Cobweb above a block of water. Then get a zombie to walk onto it and right-click the Cobweb with your Mutating Sprig.%nThis will change the Saplings into the needed Critter Snares. Do this twice.%n%n[note]* May not be PETA approved[/note]

# Quest: Mad Science is the Best Science
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdw.name=Mad Science is the Best Science
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdw.desc=Next we need to fill our snares up with some critters, specifically Bats and Slimes. For the Bats, just place them beneath you and AFK if your warp is high enough to spawn bats, otherwise...uh, go caving?%n%nFor the Slimes, if you can't find any just use the Maze Slimes from the Minoshroom maze in the Twilight Forest for this. After you get them, also go collect a Wolf and an Ocelot (Lassos or Soul Vials are great for this).%n%nNow we'll be creating new life, specifically Toads and Owls. Arrange a Cobweb above a water block with grasspers at the diagonals and one of the two sets of snares in the cardinal directions. Place Attuned Stone (Charged) in one of the Grasspers, and Mutandis Extremis in the other 3. Then place one of the two animals in the center and right-click with your Mutating Sprig like when making the snares. Use the Wolf with the Bats, and the Ocelot with the Slimes. The tamed versions also work.%n%nCongratulations, you've defied the natural order and created new life! Hopefully they didn't run away because you created them outside. :(%n%nMake sure to breed them for the next part. Use Raw Porkchop or Raw Beef for Owls, and Rotten Flesh for Toads to both tame and breed them.

# Quest: Finally Binding a Familiar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJeA.name=Finally Binding a Familiar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJeA.desc=Now that you have Toads and Owls, you can choose between them and Cats to bind. Why didn't we just bind a Cat earlier? Well, you'll need them both soon anyways, and who doesn't love choices? To carry out the Rite of Binding (P6, Circle Magic), you'll need to distill some Demonic Blood. Do that now, and collect the rest of the items needed.%n%nAfter collecting the items, bind your familiar using them. Make sure you have enough Altar Power. Remember that each has different benefits. See the official wiki for details. You may receive a tiny portion of damage your familiar receives (and vice versa), so park it somewhere safe. Also note that if it dies, so will you (Supposedly). You can resummon it if it dies or was dismissed previously (like if you died). If you're in hardcore mode and don't want to risk having it around, it can be dismissed by right-clicking while sneaking when it's sitting.%n%nNow go murder a few of your new friends and tear of their Owlet's Wings, and cut off their Toe of Frog. Remember to use an Arthana. The next step needs a Seer's Stone.

# Quest: Greenhouses on Mountains, Hell on Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJeQ.name=Greenhouses on Mountains, Hell on Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJeQ.desc=You're almost there! To actually use the ritual, you need to recruit a coven first. Find some Coven Witches and complete their quests:%nThe means to control the dead -> Necromantic Stone%nThe beating means to master the infernal dimension -> Demon Heart%nI must perform many curses, bring me the necessary brew -> Brew of the Grotesquex5%nI desire to predict the future -> Crystal Ball%nOr just fight something.%n%nOnce completed, they'll disappear until you need them. They will sometimes appear near your spawn point if you walk by it, so don't position it over lava or something, since they CAN die and reduce the number of your coven. You can have 6, with one extra appearing for Cauldron work. Consider keeping some extras around in a dungeon just in case.%n%nAfter you recruit your coven, you just need a few things for the ritual itself: Spider Eye, Toe of Frog, Wool of Bat, Tongue of Dog, Owlet's Wing, Attuned Stone, and Attuned Stone (Charged).%n%nTo specify the biome, look in the Book of Biomes, and find 1) the type (Forest, Plains, etc.), and 2) the number. Type determines the foci used, and number determines the amount of Glowstone Dust used to get that specific biome. Make sure to pack up a ritual circle into a circle talisman so you don't have to redraw it, and bring some cobblestone to make a flat area (15x15, any height). Try not to do it at night unless you like dealing with infernals.%n%nTo actually do the ritual, have the ritual circle on the ground, the items (including the foci and Glowstone) in the circle, and right-click the center with the Seer's Stone.%n%nThe area affected is determined by the number of witches in your coven. It's 16 * (size of coven - 3) radius in a circular area, so 16/32/48 if it doesn't fail.%n%nUnfortunately, sometimes after logging out and back in again, you may find that it didn't work correctly in specific chunks, this is (possibly) due to a lack of chunk updates and it not saving the changed biome ID correctly. Just redoing the ritual doesn't really help, you'll just get patches in the same places, however placing water after the ritual and before logging out may help with this. Or use chickens. Lots of chickens.%n%nAlso, if you already have crops in the area, they'll disappear until a block update or relog.%n%n[note]PS: To pack your circle back up, you need to bring your altar with you.[/note]

betterquesting.quest.1PpNSMRMR_-6fCQnguQX-A.desc=The forefather of the 1.12.2 Incense Altar.%n%nThe bonuses it gives are mostly similar, but the way it works is completely different.%nEach incense is meant to be tiered one after another. Currently you can only use §eWood Ash§r and §4Byrrus (Red)§r.%n%nWhite smoke will come out when there is an incense in the crucible, and the crucible will light up when it finds a player to increase the incense value of.%nOnce the player has an incense value greater than 0, their sacrificial knife will get super-charged, allowing the player to completely sacrifice all of their hearts but one.%n%nPutting §eWood Ash§r in the crucible will increase the incense value from §90§r to §9400§r.%n§4Byrrus§r increases it from §9400§r to §9800§r. It cannot get you from §90§r to §a§9800§r alone.%n%nThe LP you get from self-sacrifice will get a boost depending on your §9Incense Value§r.%n%n§dLP§r = §d200LP§r * §cHeartSacrificed§r * §bIncenseModifier§r%n%n§bIncenseModifier§r = §9IncenseValue§r * 0.001

Plan for the configuration to grow in size up to 23x23 for a single altar.%n%nKeep in mind that you get less blood, and use more when crafting in GTNH. Plan for pain and frustration too.%n%nThe altar has a 10,000L blood tank, plus a 1,000L I/O buffer (you can pump in and out, but the rate is pitifully low at the start). Blood will flow to the I/O buffer until it's full, so be aware of that before your first craft.

# Quest: Portable Battery...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAApA.name=Portable Battery...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAApA.desc=Using this binds it to you (expect to do that a lot), and consumes one heart while depositing 200LP in your 'soul network'. You can draw upon the soul network for anything that needs LP such as Alchemy or Rituals. If you want to automate it, you can put it into your altar for a 1:1 conversion of blood.%n%nThe highest tier orb you have bound will be considered the maximum limit to LP in your network, but you'll need to put it into the appropriately tiered altar to keep absorbing blood.

betterquesting.quest.3hN7FykMSJSWSykZiEWvfQ.desc=The Integrated Ore Factory allows you to process ores through multiple processes at once.

# Quest: Main Quests and Secondary Quests
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABA.name=§1§lMain Quests and Secondary Quests
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABA.desc=Now that you've made it this far, you might notice how the two new quests look different.%n%nThe quest with the jagged edges is a main quest - it is linked to other main quests by a thick line. You must complete main quests to unlock the next tier and to progress in general. If you can't progress, go back to previous tiers and look for uncompleted main quests.%n%nThe other quest is an optional quest, and is not needed to unlock new tiers. However, optional quests often introduce you to useful items or processes.%n%nWhat are the coins for? You can use them to purchase things in the "Coins, Coins, Coins" questbook tab - you have to scroll to the bottom once it unlocks!%n%nIn case you started in a bad biome, here's enough coins to purchase some saplings.

# Quest: Monster Hunter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACw.name=§1§lMonster Hunter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACw.desc=It's about time to craft something more useful: A sword!%n%nNow that you have a sword, you will get credit for monster kills in the Kill All the Things tab. Watch out, monsters in this world will chew you up and spit you out!%n%nYou can find additional weapon quests on the Getting Around tab.

# Quest: What's That...?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADg.name=§1§lWhat's That...?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADg.desc=You've seen a lot of trees, but there are a few that look really special. You are sure that these trees are much more than just wood to build your home with or used to get charcoal. You're sure that these will be Very Important soon™.%n%nThe best place to find them is in a Magical Forest, but if you can't find one, you can try a Garden or Cherry Wood Grove. Or just randomly everywhere.%n%nIf you have trouble finding them, you can go to the Coins tab and buy them.

# Quest: Steam-a-licious!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARg.name=§3§lSteam-a-licious!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARg.desc=You've almost made it. One last crafting step is required in order to advance to Tier 1. Keep going!%n%nThis Steam Turbine generates electricity from Steam. The power source you've been using is the same, but from this point on you will generate EU, and bring it to your machines via cables, instead of bringing the Steam directly to them. Luckily, electric machines don't need an exhaust port, and they are considerably more efficient than Bronze machines.%n%nAt a later point, you will most likely switch from Steam to another fuel, though.

# Quest: Dark Steel Tools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjA.name=§6§lDark Steel Tools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjA.desc=There are also tools made of dark steel. Each of them can receive upgrades.

It can be upgraded to teleport the player.%n%nDark shears can be empowered, and then will shear a large area, including leaves. Handy for clearing away that giant redwood! Maybe you will find other uses for it.%n%nThe axe, once empowered, can be recharged wirelessly while in farming station.%n%nThe pick? Well, it can mine cobalt I guess if you haven't gotten a tool capable of that yet. You could keep it around to use for base decorations if your normal pick is too fast, I suppose.

# Quest: And It Will Never Break
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmA.name=§9§lAnd It Will Never Break
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmA.desc=By using an etheric sword, your killer joe will run...forever. Proper enchantments are a requirement for it to be efficient, but that shouldn't be a problem.

# Quest: Appropriate Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAvg.name=§a§lAppropriate Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAvg.desc=Whether you used magic, steam, oil or biogas for power until now, you will run into problems as you advance to higher tiers. So you'll need to upgrade your power grid, at least for your EBF(s). So let's start with something more powerful: A nuclear reactor!%n%nIf you want to know how they work, refer to The Internet or the Reactor Planner at [url]https://github.com/MauveCloud/Ic2ExpReactorPlanner/releases[/url]%n%nNote: The EU multiplier is set to 10x in this pack. That means your nuclear reactor is 10 times more efficient. Make sure to set the planner to GTNH mode under advanced. Also, the base numbers (before 10xing) can be seen on the hover text for all the components.%n%nIf you just want to use them, go to [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Nuclear_Reactors[/url] for reactor designs. The Thorium 1920 EU one is probably best for now.

# Quest: Basic Nuclear Fuel: Thorium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQ.name=§a§lBasic Nuclear Fuel: Thorium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQ.desc=The weakest of all fuel rods, but very easy to produce, very easy to keep cool and runs twice as long as uranium. It even returns 1/3 of the thorium back later. A perfect "fission and forget" power source.%n%n[warn]Note: After they're used up you can recycle them to get Lutetium which is used for making americium in the fusion reactor. Americium is needed for top tier materials later, so start stockpiling now. Plus, you get power![/warn]

# Quest: Monitoring Your Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwg.name=§a§lMonitoring Your Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwg.desc=It's important to monitor your reactor (Or just fancy to have a big screen somewhere...). So now that you've gained knowledge about the available fuel rods, you can start to build yourself a power plant. Here is something to help you out.%n%nUse the sensor kit on the block you want to monitor, then put the sensor card in the display panel. Next select which lines of information you want to display.

# Quest: Increasing the Capacity
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAww.name=§a§lIncreasing the Capacity
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAww.desc=To unleash the full potential of your reactor, you have to attach six reactor chambers to it.

# Quest: Move the Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxA.name=§a§lMove the Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxA.desc=Heat exchangers are a passive way to pull heat from the reactor or adjacent components and spread it out across a wider area. Their performance is measured in heat units per tick (Hu/t), and there are a few different types that all work slightly differently. [note]Moving heat around is not enough on its own. Heat vents or coolant cells are required to actually dissipate it.[/note]%n%nHeat Exchanger: Pulls 4 Hu/t from the reactor and 12 Hu/t from adjacent components.%n%nAdvanced Heat Exchanger: Pulls 8 Hu/t from the reactor and 24 Hu/t from adjacent components.%n%nReactor Heat Exchanger: Pulls 72 Hu/t from the reactor.%n%nComponent Heat Exchanger: Pulls 36 Hu/t from adjacent components.

# Quest: Venting Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxQ.name=§a§lVenting Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxQ.desc=Heat vents are a passive way to remove heat from your reactor. Their performance is measured in heat units per tick (Hu/t), and there are a few different types that all work slightly differently.%n%nThese heat vents simply cool themselves after absorbing heat from adjacent fuel rods and heat exchangers:%n%nHeat Vent: Cools itself by 6 Hu/t%n%nAdvanced Heat Vent: Cools itself by 12 Hu/t%n%nThese heat vents absorb heat and cool themselves much like the ones above, but they also pull heat directly from the reactor core to themselves:%n%nReactor Heat Vent: Cools itself by 5 Hu/t and the reactor by 5 Hu/t%n%nOverclocked Heat Vent: Cools itself by 20 Hu/t and the reactor by 36 Hu/t[note]Since it pulls more heat from the reactor than it dissipates, these are prone to melting if their heat is not balanced by a heat exchanger[/note]%n%nThe Component Heat Vent works differently to the other vents. Rather than absorbing heat and cooling itself or the reactor, it simply cools adjacent components (but not fuel rods) by 4 Hu/t

# Quest: Making a Better Sword
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB2Q.name=§2§lMaking a Better Sword
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB2Q.desc=Now it's time to make your first tinkers sword. First you have to make a blade, a type of guard, and tool rod cast forms. Melt some bronze in the smeltery and cast your tool parts. Tadaa... your first tinkers sword. There are 4 types of guard, changing them gets you a different sword type, see the tinker's book for details.

# Quest: Industrial 3D Copying Machine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgw.name=Industrial 3D Copying Machine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgw.desc=Need large amounts of chiseled blocks? This is the machine for you.

# Quest: Draconic Evolution
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABhA.name=§6§lDraconic Evolution
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABhA.desc=You have tinkered long and hard to try to combine magic and technology. It looks like you finally found a way! Combining your powers as a thaumaturge and blood mage with your UHV technology you think you have found a way to distill the power of a dragon into a small core. This machine can do it, you are sure. If only you know how precisely to assembler such a core.%n%n[note]Use a hologram projector to see how it is built. You can also upgrade your draconic cores but for that you need the higher tier schematics and you need to upgrade the multiblock.[/note]

# Quest: Shields UP
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABvg.name=§1§lShields UP
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABvg.desc=With a sword in one hand, what can you do with the other? Right, you need a shield. Let's make one.

# Quest: Shield Update
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwA.name=§1§lShield Update
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwA.desc=Your wooden shield is very weak. So you should make a better one. Looks like you need some leather, so go and find some cows.

# Quest: Your First 'Long Range' Weapon
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwg.name=§1§lYour First 'Long Range' Weapon
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwg.desc=You can't make a vanilla bow or Tinkers weapons yet, but you can make a spear!%n%nSome monsters will become much easier to kill with this long-range weapon.

# Quest: Exploding Fluids For Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFA.name=§5§lExploding Fluids For Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFA.desc=The Combustion Generator produces EU from several fluids and spends fuel only when necessary. Some fluids are more popular than others, but the Oil processing line has a different combustion fluid in every tier from LV to EV, and all of them are burned in these generators.%n%nTo start, LV is the tier of Light Fuel. It is worth much more than the Oil itself for generating power, so you should distill and dessulfurize the Oil to get clean Light Fuel and use it for power. It's a great way to run your base, and can be upgraded further in the next tiers. Check the "Working with Oil" tab for more information, once you've made a Pump and found some Oil.%n%nIf you're dealing with Oil processing, this is the type of generator you'll use the most.§r

# Quest: Hydrogen, Methane or Some Farts... (Natural gas) 
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFQ.name=§5§lHydrogen, Methane or Some Farts... (Natural gas) 
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFQ.desc=Some centrifugal processes leave gases behind like Hydrogen or Methane. Centrifuge some Brown and Yellow Limonite to get Hydrogen or dump your unused food in a Centrifuge to get Methane gas. Wood will even give 60 mb per log, and many other crops will also generate Methane this way.%n%nThe main powergen line that uses this generator is Benzene, but that needs MV tier.%n%nIf you're dealing with fully renewable powergen, this is the type of generator you'll use the most.

# Quest: Hello Baron, How's Your Black Gold Today?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIg.name=§5§lHello Baron, How's Your Black Gold Today?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIg.desc=During your travels you may have seen some huge oil spouts. Now's the time to make a pump and go collect this black gold into tanks. Oil can be burned directly in a combustion generator (onsite to power the pump, perhaps?) or be refined for better fuels and crafting materials.%n%nBring a generator or battery buffer (with full batteries obviously) with you to power the pump. Thanks to the advancement of technology the pump can auto output on top. Stacking multiple pumps makes them work faster. In that case, oil has to be removed from the bottom of the stack using a pump cover or other means like a conduit.%n%nTaller spouts have more oil. But for the LV pump, it's better to use the short spouts if possible since it doesn't have enough range to fully collect the larger ones in the horizontal range. Save the taller spouts for MV or HV pumps.%n%nMining pipes are needed for pumping the oil, same as the auto miner. When it hits the bottom (or something in the way), if there's no fluid left to collect, it will start retracting the pipes. Same thing if you disable it with a soft mallet. You can also change the range with a screwdriver if there's a reason to do that, like collecting lava in a limited area faster.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on all sides. And set a waypoint with JourneyMaps so you don't forget where you placed it!%n%n[note]Once you run out of surface oil, you'll want to turn to:%n1) Oilsands ore, though this is better suited for making heavy oil%n2) Making oil from logs in a pyrolyze oven%n4) Bacterial Vat (EV+)%n5) Crops%n6) Bees%n7) Underground (UG) oil.

# Quest: Working Table 2.0
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQA.name=Working Table 2.0
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQA.desc=A manual crafting table which remembers the last nine used recipes. Left-click one of the recipes shown in the right-hand side to automatically fill in the crafting grid. Right-click to lock a memorized recipe and prevent a newer recipe from bumping it off.%n%nResources need to go into the internal inventory. The crafting matrix is only a visual representation.%n%nThe Forestry worktable is super-useful, and can reduce the tedium of many common jobs because you can click-drag across a row of items, and it will use tools in its own inventory to continue crafting.%n%nSpecifically:%nMaking <Item X> with <Bucket of Y> - Put all the ingredients into the table, and if the recipe is selected, shift-click the result to craft them all at once (until you run out)%nMaking fresh water for Pam's - Same as above, but no second item%nMaking clay bricks - The wooden form is automatically reused%nMaking anything that uses a tool - Also automatically reused, while consuming durability%n%n[warn]Warning: Stored recipes will be lost if the worktable is broken!

# Quest: Moron's Manual to Fecund Farms
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzg.name=Moron's Manual to Fecund Farms
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzg.desc=If you ever wanted to know how crop breeding works, you are in the right place! Get some Crops - the sticks, that is - and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane.%n%nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdWdFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%nNow place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.%n%nWhen they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks once more on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.%n%nWith some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.%n%nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.%n%nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work. Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds.%n%nIf you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.%n%nNote that the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.%n%nDon't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing.%n%nCrossing happens when two or more almost-mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a high chance of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation. For more details, check out the IC2 cropnalyzer quest.

# Quest: Your First Bow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADXg.name=§2§lYour First Bow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADXg.desc=Since vanilla bows are only craftable in the assembling machine and mobs don't drop them very often you should make a Tinkers bow.%n%nWood would be the best material for now. Craft the bow limbs out of wood and the bow string out of strings. The arrow that has the most durability is bone, so craft the stick out of bone. It is much lighter but less durable than a regular arrow. Use a flint tip to make it repairable with flint.%n%nYou can repair your bow the same way as all the other Tinkers tools. The arrows can be regained by repairing them or picking them up from the floor. The arrows should be in your inventory if you want to pick up the ones you fired. You can't pick them up if they are in Battlegear slots.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADYA.desc=Is the bone bow too expensive for your taste? Then make a flint throwing knife instead. You need flint and a stick to get 12 knives. The durability and the attack damage are very low but it still helps with killing mobs from a safe distance.%n%nThe knives should be in your inventory if you want to pick up the ones you fired. You can't pick them up if the knives are in Battlegear slots.

# Quest: Power of the Sun
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADpQ.name=§6§lPower of the Sun
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADpQ.desc=Now it's time to invest in some renewable energy. Let's start with solar panels. The basic one only gives 1 EU/t. Most GT machines can use them as covers, and receive power, but only so long as it can see the sun (the top). Be sure to put a glass layer above them in case it rains while you swap panels. You'll still want to keep rain off the sides of the machine hull too.%n%n[note]The Aluminium Iron plate needs an MV Forming Press.[/note]

# Quest: Power of the Sun ULV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADpg.name=§6§lPower of the Sun ULV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADpg.desc=The next solar panel you can make is the ULV one. It generates 8 EU/t.

# Quest: Even More Compact Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERw.name=§2§lEven More Compact Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERw.desc=If you found enough gold, you can upgrade your chest to make it an even bigger inventory of 9x9.%n%n[note]Do you have iron chests that are too small? You can also upgrade with a fitting upgrade item.[/note]

# Quest: Moron's Guide to Better Trees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWw.name=Moron's Guide to Better Trees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWw.desc=Forestry trees have a variety of attributes. Once you get a tree with a useful attribute, you can breed that attribute into other tree species. This way you can get an ultimate tree that combines all the attributes you want - including the type of fruit! You can also extract the genes with Gendustry if you can make the machines.%n%n[warn]Please do your Forestry tree-breeding indoors or underground because butterflies cause lag.[/warn]%n%nKeep in mind that for quests, you will need to breed the species "pure", not a hybrid. You should probably save the crossbreeding until after you get all the good ones.%n%nFor faster tree breeding, enclose your trees so that butterflies cannot escape, and breed bees with better traits for area and pollination speed. There's also frames too if you can afford it. The sieve may also help if you want to do it more exactly if you can make an alveary. You need either bees or butterflies, trees won't pollinate each other.%n%nTrees have the following characteristics:%n§eSaplings/Fertility§r: chance of getting a sapling from a destroyed leaf. Good for making into biomass or other uses. Balsa, Gooseberry and Sweetgum are what you want.%n%nAllele     Drop Chance%nLowest   1%%%nLower    2.5%%%nLow       3.5%%%nAverage 5%%%nHigh      10%%%n%n[warn]Maturation/Matures[/warn]: the growth speed of a sapling into a tree.

Wider trees have more leaves and logs, but will also need more saplings to begin growing. All saplings must be the same species and girth. The sapling in the NW corner determines the stats of the new tree, and is where bone meal must be applied to mature the tree. The Giant Sequoia is best here too.%n%nAllele/Size%n1x1%n2x2%n3x3%n4x4%n%nYield: chances of getting a fruit from a destroyed leaf.

You can boost the Fermenter's output by using honey or fruit juice. Blue Mahoe and Red Maple are the best. NEI doesn't show recipes for analyzed saplings, and probably hybrids too, in the fermenter.%n%nAllele  Forestry Biomass%nLowest   100mB%nLower    200mB%nLow       300mB%nAverage 400mB%nHigh       600mB%n%n[warn]Fireproof[/warn]: applies to the wood. Only the Coast and Giant Sequoia have this.%n%n§7Effect§r: not used in trees, so it's None for any.%n%nBelow is more information on some other parameters:%n%n§2Growth§r: Sipiri trees have Tropical instead of Light, can only be bred in a Biome with temperature 90%%-190%% and humidity 90%%-200%%, and can only grow in 120%%-190%% temp and 90%%-200%% humidity. All other trees just need light to grow.%n%n[note]Territory/Soil[/note]: all trees have Average, whatever that means. Probably something related to the below that never really got used.%n%n§eTolerates§r: if it can be planted on sand or not. Only Desert Acacia and Grandidier's Baobab have this. The trait is either Plains or Plains, Desert.%n%n§5Supports§r: what kind of fruits it can theoretically have. Determined by Species. Only fruits from families listed under this trait can be produced by the tree, regardless of what appears under the tree's Fruits trait. There are a number of trees from the Extra Trees mod that support all 4 types, but none from Forestry itself.%n%n§aFruit§r: determines what fruit or nut it produces. Each fruit/nut provides different advantages:%nPlum and Cherry Plum only produces 100L Fruit Juice, but have a 60%% chance of producing Mulch in the Fluid Extractor or Squeezer.%nPapaya produces 600L Fruit Juice, but only has a 10%% chance to produce Mulch.%nCoconuts produce 300L Seed Oil, but only have a 25%% chance to produce Mulch.%nUse a Forestry Multifarm so you don't have to break the leaf block to get the fruit/nut. Set it to Manual Orchard, and place everything first.%n%n§bFamily§r: Tells you what family of the fruit listed under the Fruits trait is: Pomes, Prunes, Nuts or Jungle.

# Quest: Firestone Ore/Dust
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE_w.name=§6§lFirestone Ore/Dust
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE_w.desc=Firestone ore is used to make some BC machines like the filler, and some other stuff. Unfortunately, it's in the nether...at the bottom of the lava ocean!%n%nHere are some tips for finding it:%n%n-Firestone only spawns in deep lava, at least 6 deep. It will only replace netherrack, so a fjord filled with soulsand won't have any. Can you think of ways to check the lava depth, and what's down there?%n-Alternatively, if you keep your head at just the correct height above the lava and at the correct angle, you'll be able to see underneath it - surely there must be a hovering jetpack?%n-...or just look for the biome when your cursor is over the JM map. Hell is the default one that has netherrack.%n%nFirestone can be mined with the GT miners, if you place it within horizontal range. Firestone ore and products will cause random fires to start nearby, so get it into a backpack quickly!

# Quest: Kinetic Power HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcQ.name=§9§lKinetic Power HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcQ.desc=The Kinetic Generator will transform mechanical energy into electricity. The EU output depends on the KU input. It is most commonly used together with a Kinetic Wind Generator or Kinetic Water Generator. The Kinetic Steam Generator only has one tier, so you should probably use a Steam Turbine instead.%n%nWhen placing a kinetic generator, any time, the "input" side is the side facing you. So you will place the kinetic generator, then the wind/water/steam gen, and then place a rotor inside. Power can be drawn from any side of the kinetic generator, up to the rated amount per side.%n%nWARNING: Breaking a kinetic generator improperly will not return the generator. Use a GT wrench, and right-click it. It should drop immediately. Try again if it just changed directions.

# Quest: Kinetic Wind Power HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcg.name=§9§lKinetic Wind Power HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcg.desc=The Kinetic Wind Generator generates energy from wind power which varies randomly, although certain factors can change this.%n%nUnlike the Windmill, the Kinetic Wind Generator will require maintenance in the form of Rotors. These are needed to run the Kinetic Wind Generator.%nOnce a Rotor is placed inside the GUI, the block is given sufficient space, and the current wind level is adequate for the current rotor, the Kinetic Wind Generator will begin to generate Kinetic Energy.%n%nThis can be converted into EU by using a Kinetic Generator attached to the correct face (the black circle).%n%nAbout Wind%nFirst off, the wind strength of a particular area is affected by 3 factors: Height, Weather, and Chance. The higher up in the world you are, the higher the wind level. Below y64, there is never enough wind to be used, and KWG's will not function at all. Weather will also give boosts; Rainy weather will give a 20%% boost to normal wind levels, and stormy weather will give a 50%% boost. The final factor of chance makes the wind strength vary randomly, however there is a limited range of variation.%n%nThe easiest way to check the current wind level in an area is by using a Windmeter. Wind is strongest at around Y160, towards the build limit of Y255 there is very little wind, hence no point attempting to run Windmills that high. While inconvenient, the Wind Generator can run anywhere.

# Quest: Kinetic Water Power HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcw.name=§9§lKinetic Water Power HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcw.desc=The Kinetic Water Generator allows Kinetic Units to be produced via the movement of water in river and ocean biomes. As with the Kinetic Wind Generator, it requires either Gearbox Rotor. Search NEI for appropriate options.%n%nIf the Kinetic Water Generator's Rotor isn't entirely submerged in water, it will alert you there is "no room for the rotor". If the Kinetic Water Generator isn't placed in a river, ocean or deep ocean biome, it will alert you it "must be placed in a river or ocean biome". Check the Game Mechanics spreadsheet on Discord for a list of biomes and their tags.%n%nWhile inconvenient, the Water Generator runs more consistently.%n%n[warn]You can use Witchery (for example) to convert biomes.[/warn]

# Quest: Rotor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEdA.name=§c§9§lRotor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEdA.desc=The Kinetic Wind and Water Generators need Gearbox Rotors to function. They can be added and removed with standard automation. Higher tier rotors will last longer. In addition, the iridium ones don't break. The IC2 ones might bug out for durability loss though. Energetic is probably the best for now, since it can give out a full amp, and more is wasted.%n%n[note]You only need to make one rotor to complete this quest.[/note]

# Quest: Wind Meter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEdQ.name=§9§lWind Meter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEdQ.desc=The Windmeter measures wind strength. It shows you on which height you can place your Wind Generator.

# Quest: Sending the Power Back
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEeQ.name=§9§lSending the Power Back
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEeQ.desc=Kinetic generator compatibility has been improved so that you no longer need transformers, you can connect directly with a cable. But why not use your transformer to send the power back to base more efficiently, it's a loss of about 57/512EU per A just going from 160 straight down to 63 without it. If you transform up (after going through 1 block of cable to transform it to GT power), you only lose about 57/2048EU per A, much better.%n%n[warn]IC2 machines don't care about rain, but remember to cover your transformer.[/warn]

# Quest: GT6-Styled Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEeg.name=§2§lGT6-Styled Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEeg.desc=Wondering why new pipes don't always auto-connect? This was changed to make the pipes smarter. You can now use a wrench to connect only the pipes you want. You don't need a plate or a foil to prevent pipes from connecting anymore. The pipes will still autoconnect if you build one onto the other.%n%nPipes transferring anything hotter than a certain amount, like steam, will cause damage to a player touching them. You might want to cover hot pipes to prevent getting hurt. Also, if the heat level is higher than the pipe's heat capacity, it will melt.%n%nPressing RMB on a pipe in the center of the 'grid' will enable or disable a connection. It will have an X through it if the connection is enabled. You can do the same to any of the 4 corners to adjust the opposite side. You can similarly connect each of the 4 sides by clicking on the closest box in the grid.%n%nPipes have a free built-in shutter to reduce sloshing. Shift-RMB with a wrench on the side you want to prevent input.%n%nPipes attempt to transfer half of their capacity twice per second, so the full capacity per second in total.%n%nLarge or Huge fluid pipes can be a poor man's storage tank, holding large amounts on their own.%n%nFor machine outputs, including the boilers and Railcraft water tanks - the one made of Water Tank Siding - you will not need pumps. Other tanks will need pumps or Tinker's Construct faucets to move fluids.%n%nYou can put covers such as GT oak planks or plates on a pipe as well. Normally this prevents connections in that direction, but you can use a screwdriver to enable connections. This lets you make pipes that look nice going through walls. Use a crowbar to remove covers.

# Quest: Magnalium Crossbow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEfg.name=§5§lMagnalium Crossbow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEfg.desc=It's time to craft a Crossbow Limb and the Crossbow Body to upgrade your old Wooden Crossbow.

# Quest: Wooden Crossbow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEfw.name=§3§lWooden Crossbow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEfw.desc=Now you are able to make a better long range weapon - a crossbow. Use wood for the crossbow limb and the body and use obsidian (Reinforced III) for the tough binding. Normal strings for the bowstrings would be enough for now.%n%nAssemble the bow yourself on your tool forge.%n%n[warn]For upgrades:[/warn]%n[note]Redstone - Speed on the draw%nLapis - Fortune on kills%nMoss - Self-repair (this is not visible in NEI until you unlock it in the GTNH Thaumcraft tab)[/note]%n%n§6NOTE: Some mobs require damage from specific tools. IF YOU ARE SHOOTING AT SOMETHING AND IT IS NOT GETTING HURT, *RUN*. And then figure out what weapon might be best to kill it.

# Quest: Fiery Bowstring
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgA.name=§5§lFiery Bowstring
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgA.desc=Why not upgrade your bowstring too? You got some from the last quest, but will need to find some more in the Nether by killing spiders. Craft some fiery bowstring with it.

# Quest: Ardite Crossbow Body
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgQ.name=§5§lArdite Crossbow Body
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgQ.desc=To make your crossbow even better, craft an ardite crossbow body. You received a few ardite ingots as reward before but will need to find ore in the Nether and process it in an Electric Blast Furnace.%n%nWith redstone you can make your bow faster. This requires a free modifier slot on your crossbow.%n%nDon't bother putting Nether Quartz on the crossbow, it only improves damage from whacking mobs over the head with it. Put the Nether Quartz on your bolts instead.

# Quest: Magnalium Crossbow Bolts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgg.name=§5§lMagnalium Crossbow Bolts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgg.desc=Magnalium bolts are much better than your old wooden bolts.%n%nYou can use nether quartz on the bolts to make them even better. This requires a free modifier slot.%n%nExperiment with NEI to find other good bolt materials.%n%nTo make these bolts, you must use a Fluid Solidifer instead of the Tinker's casting table. It's important that you get the molten iron out of the smeltery and into the Fluid Solidifier, the GT molten iron won't work.%n%nThe bolts should be in your inventory if you want to pick up the ones you fired. You can't pick them up if the bolts are in Battlegear slots.

# Quest: Wooden Bolts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEhA.name=§3§lWooden Bolts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEhA.desc=Your crossbow need some ammo to shoot with. Let's craft some wooden bolts. For now, you can put either iron, obzinite, or steel on the tip of your bolts using the Smeltery. For higher tier bolts and tips you will need to pump metals into a Fluid Solidifier with the correct tool rod inserted.%n%n[warn]For upgrades:[/warn]%n[note]Nether Quartz - More damage%nMoss - Self-Repair (unlock in GTNH Thaumcraft tab)[/note]

# Quest: Making Power With Your Plasma
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsA.name=§d§l§f§c§lMaking Power With Your Plasma
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsA.desc=Now that you have a reactor, it's time to utilize it to create power.%n%nThe simplest plasma you can make for power is Helium plasma, but it also provides a lot of power. Deuterium is renewable from water, and you can get Helium-3 from Endstone.%n%nHowever, you will need a way to convert the plasma into EU. To do this you will need a large plasma turbine. This will also need a dynamo hatch that can handle the power you're outputting. For Helium plasma, you will want a LuV Buffered Dynamo or above.

# Quest: Turbine Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsQ.name=§a§b§c§d§e§f§d§l§l§c§lTurbine Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsQ.desc=Your fancy new Large Plasma Turbine will need a rotor to go inside of it.%n%nYou can make it out of any GT material, but the best right now is NORMAL Draconium. [warn]Always test in Creative first![/warn]%n%nWhen using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Plasma Turbines being the best at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 250%% of optimal flow to produce 158%% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 400%% of optimal flow to produce 214%% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 550%% of optimal flow to produce 301%% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.%n%nThe choice is yours!%n%n[note]For a lot of extra information on fusion, check out the new quest line called Powerful Nuclear Physics.[/note]

# Quest: All Alone in the Night
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF1w.name=§1§lAll Alone in the Night
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF1w.desc=Thanks to our amazing devs, you no longer have to use a command block to reload your questbook between updates. This means you'll get all new quests automatically upon updating to a new version of GTNH! Isn't that convenient?%n%nIf, for whatever reason, you want to manually reload your questbook, you can do so by typing /bq_admin default load in the chat window. You will need to be an admin for it to work, though.%n%nHere's another questbook in case you already lost the one you spawned with. Don't forget that it can also be viewed at any time by pressing the Tilde (~) key if you have not changed its keybind.%n%n§3Some command blocks are still used for specific tasks, but they do not concern the average player since they are admin-only and thus are not craftable.

# Quest: How the Heck Do I Find Ores?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF2A.name=§2§lHow the Heck Do I Find Ores?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF2A.desc=GregTech ore generation is based on veins. Veins have a fixed height and a rectangular base.%n%nThere is a vein every 3 chunks in x and z direction. The veins typically extend into the neighboring chunks and have varying forms. The center point however is very regular. It is based on the chunk number. Look at upper left of the screen to find the chunk number. This info is displayed by InGame Info XML mod. For now, you need to see chunk info like "Chunk X: 3 Z: -2".%n%nThe 3,-2 is the chunk's address. The orecenters are located at chunk numbers of the form 3N+1 for both x and z. So, 4,7 is an orecenter, as well as 10,16, -23,19, and so on. If you are in the right spot InGame Info will also say that "This is an ore chunk.".%n%nAnother useful tool is the NEI ore vein overlay which you activate by pressing F9 three times. It shows the 3x3 areas and marks the center blue.%n%nThe generation of Ore Chunks is not related to biomes.%n%nFor reading all the way, here's some iron.

# Quest: Digging Deeper
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF2Q.name=§2§lDigging Deeper
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF2Q.desc=Now that you know what an Ore Chunk is, dig all the way down to bedrock to find if there is a vein located in it.%n%nCheck out an ore in NEI to see where you can find a vein that contains it. Search for it and click on it to get this info, among other things.%n%nThere are many types of ores, even just for getting one material like Iron, so don't stick to only one ore.%n%nYou can also search small ores in NEI, but not all of them are used.

# Quest: Better Questing?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF3A.name=§1§lBetter Questing?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF3A.desc=Better Questing has a number of useful commands for the questbook (QB). You need to have cheats enabled to use them.%n%n/bq_admin default load%nUse this command to update your QB after you update the modpack. It reloads the quest database from the file. Your save file stores a version of the QB that can be different from the one in the file.%n%n/bq_admin edit%nToggles editing quests. Pressing RMB on the quest will open a context menu to share it or copy its ID.%n%n/bq_admin reset all <Player>%nResets all quests. Use this if you want to start over, or are editing the QB. You should specify the player as well if it is a server, otherwise you can skip that part.%n%n/bq_admin reset <ID> <Player>%nResets a specific quest, defined by the quest ID. Sometimes it may be easier to go into Edit Mode > Designer Tool to specify what to reset.%n%n/bq_admin complete <number> <Player>%nCompletes a specific quest, similarly to the above. You can still claim the rewards. Use this command if a quest is broken, and then report it on GitHub, but please check if it's already reported.%n%n/bq_admin default save%nSaves changes to the QB after editing it.%n%n/bq_copyquests <PlayerWithQuestsCompleted> <NewPlayer>%nIf you want to sync the quests with someone in your party, then use this. They won't get any rewards for that though.%n%n/bq_admin hardcore%nEnables BQ3 Hardcore Mode. You only start with 3 lives, so best of luck. Additional life hearts are available in the Kill all the Things tab.%n%nAside from the consume-type quests, a quest counts for everyone in the party if one person finished it. However, if someone joined your party later, you need to get them up to speed first either through /bq_copyquests above, or manually. Otherwise, your quest completion won't count for them because the requirements for that quest are not fulfilled for them.%n%nIf your singleplayer world does not have cheats enabled, go to the ESC screen, open to LAN, then enable cheats. This makes pausing impossible until you reload afterwards. If you host a server, you can run the commands in the command line, without "/". You can also edit the level.dat file, and set 'allowCommands' to 1, but make sure to backup your world before doing that.%n%n[warn]For quests to save properly, you must be online and logged into your Mojang account when starting the game. Sorry, it's a limitation of Better Questing.[/warn]

# Quest: Backup Your Stuff...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF3Q.name=§1§lBackup Your Stuff...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF3Q.desc=The mod ServerUtilities (SU) is included in the pack to backup your world. You can adjust save path, frequency, and the number of backups to keep in its settings at '.minecraft\serverutilities\serverutilities.cfg'.%n%nIf you need to restore from a backup, you can find them in the backups folder in the instance directory.%n%nRemember that the mods JourneyMap and Thaumcraft Node Tracker store information outside of what most solutions backup, so please backup your journeymap and tcnodetracker folders yourself.%n%nThe Thaumcraft data is a little buggy, losing scanned aspect data and Thaumonomicon data, so consider backing it up as well. The file is at 'saves\<worldname>\playerdata\<nameofplayer>.thaum'.%n%nIf you move to another drive or computer, don't forget to migrate all the backed up files, not just the world folder.

# Quest: Nobody Wants an Explosion...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF3w.name=§6§lNobody Wants an Explosion...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF3w.desc=...right? So when building multiblocks, make sure you:%n%n1. Don't cross chunk boundaries with the multiblock.%n%n2. If possible, don't rely on resources coming from outside the chunk. Make sure you source your water locally.%n%nKeep in mind that electric machines don't like getting rain or snow on them. They'll start fires, and those fires have a chance of causing an explosion. This explosion will explode other machines, cascading until your whole base is a hole in the ground. This is one of the reason backups are a thing. Stay safe out there!%n%nIf worse comes to worst, there is logs/Explosion.log that tracks what caused an explosion. However, this file appears to reset on world load.

# Quest: Not Enough Items - Now with Bookmarks and Recent History!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF4Q.name=§2§lNot Enough Items - Now with Bookmarks and Recent History!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF4Q.desc=More like too many items! Here are some tips for using NEI.%n%nWhen you have your inventory open, you can type the search terms in the text bar at the bottom. Make sure your GUI size is set correctly, or you won't be able to see it. Double-click the bar to highlight any matching items in your inventory or inventories you're looking at. Handy for searching for a specific ore, as they tend to look the same!%n%nEven better, you can use T to search nearby inventories, which will emit some particles.%n%nWe have also provided the special Y command to look for a machine in the world, in case you've forgotten where you placed that Advanced Circuit Assembler.%n%nWe now have an extra-fancy Bookmark feature! The default key is A, but can be changed in the NEI config window. Bookmarks will be on the left side of the inventory, and you can look up their recipes or uses as normal. To move a bookmark, drag it with Shift+LMB. You can even bookmark entire recipes with Shift+A or recipes with amounts using Ctrl+Shift+A.%n%nPressing O will hide NEI, useful for fancy screenshots.

# Quest: NEI is More Powerful Than You Imagine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF4g.name=§2§lNEI is More Powerful Than You Imagine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF4g.desc=NEI has some really nice advanced features too.%n%nClicking LMB or pressing R on an item shows the recipes to create it. RMB or U show recipes that use the item. Backspace moves you back to the previously browsed recipe.%n%nHold Shift to stop the oredict cycling through items, and to show the oredict entries for the current item under your cursor.%n%nSearch using @ to find all items from that mod; for example, §o@thaumcraft§r will list all Thaumcraft items and blocks.%n%nYou can combine multiple search terms with a space. §o@thaumcraft table§r will search for anything with table in the name or description, in the mod Thaumcraft.%n%nIt has even more advanced features than mentioned here and many configuration options, you can look in the NEI option menu under Inventory to find a few. Here you can change more things about how the search works (like using regex), toggle collapsible items or the item zoom panel, or configure the history panel to your liking.

# Quest: Angel Wings - Combine!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFTA.name=Angel Wings - Combine!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFTA.desc=The last step is to combine the quantum armor with your quantum wings. [note]This is not nearly as good as the other option, the GraviChestPlate.[/note]

# Quest: Light It Up!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFWg.name=Light It Up!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFWg.desc=The arcane lamp creates additional light sources which acts like a Torch in a sphere with a radius of 16 blocks centered on it. This will include caves or other areas behind walls. That might be useful...%n%nWhen attached to the base of an arcane bore, the arcane lamp gains an additional ability: It will light up the tunnel that the bore digs.

# Quest: Mallard Rust Smelly
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFiA.name=§b§lMallard Rust Smelly
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFiA.desc=Or is it Alloy Blast Smelter? Well, that makes more sense. This multiblock creates the higher tier alloys needed for more advanced multiblocks and your soldering needs. It directly smelts ingredients into liquids. You can even melt down metals like Tungsten faster too! Until you get better coils for your EBF at least.%n%n[note]Most of the multiblocks you can now make are optional, but quite powerful upgrades to your current singleblock setups. Not only do they provide more speed, they also have a bit of advanced functionality: you can also electrolyze materials without using cells or use a single multiblock for many different extruder shapes. They also act as cleanrooms where needed.[/note]

# Quest: Shake That Booty...

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFjA.desc=...out of the purified ores. Anyways, a Large Sifter will increase your sifting speed significantly. What will you do with all these gems??%n%n[note]You need one more casing if you don't want to use 2 energy hatches.[/note]

# Quest: Launch Controller
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFrA.name=Launch Controller
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFrA.desc=The Launch Controller has been modified in GTNH to provide additional functionality. If you launch from a Launch Pad with the Launch Controller set up, the countdown will be greatly reduced, and you will teleport directly to the receiving Launch Pad. It will use half the rocket's fuel up though. This is very useful on laggy servers and can act as an early teleport option if you don't like the magical solutions. You will need to set up a Rocket Launch Pad with Launch Controller and possibly a Fuel Loader on either side.%n%nIf you don't to use it for yourself, you can also try to use it for the Cargo Rocket. To use those at full capacity it is necessary to equip a Rocket Launch Pad, to send items, with:%n%nFuel Loader%nLaunch Controller%nCargo Loader%nAnd the receiving side with:%n%nFuel Loader%nLaunch Controller%nCargo Unloader%n%nIt is also possible to use Buildcraft pipes to transfer items into the Cargo loaders. Next step is to set up the Frequencies in both Launch Controllers (i.e. Set: A to target B, B to target A). Have a look at Launch Controller to set up the automated launch. The first time you have to right-click the Cargo rocket and press launch at the top right corner.

# Quest: Arc Lamp
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFuA.name=Arc Lamp
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFuA.desc=The Arc Lamp is a very bright lamp. It is directional - meaning the light it casts is brighter in the direction it is facing. Its facing can be rotated using a standard Wrench.%n%nIncluding the Arc Lamp the brightness of blocks which are close to light sources is:%n%nRedstone Torch: 3-6%nTorch: 9-12%nBlock of Glowstone: 10-13%nArc Lamp: 13-14%n%nThe Arc Lamp can light up a fairly large area - for example a whole room - at light level 14: it is almost as bright as full sunlight.%n%nThe Arc Lamp also has the interesting property of actively repelling mobs. Not only does its light prevent mobs from spawning nearby, but it is so bright that if a mob comes close to the Arc Lamp the mob will turn around and walk away again. This mob-repellant effect is confirmed to work on: Zombies, Skeletons, Creepers, Evolved Zombies, Evolved Skeletons, Evolved Creepers. It may also work on other types of mobs (confirmation required). But it has no effect on Spiders (they are not afraid of sunlight either) or boss mobs.

# Quest: Brittle But Hits Like a Sledgehammer...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFzQ.name=§5§lBrittle But Hits Like a Sledgehammer...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFzQ.desc=A Carbon crossbow limb is 1/3 the durability of the magnalium limb, but hits a lot harder and shoots a little faster. But you'll want to carry around a tinker table and extra ingots to repair it constantly, and watch that you don't break it in the middle of combat!

# Quest: Traveller's Shoes Upgrades
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG-g.name=Traveller's Shoes Upgrades
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG-g.desc=Your shoes can be equipped with a few modifications like water walk, double jump, lead boots or slimy shoes. Place the shoes in the middle of a Crafting Station.%n%nWater Walk allows you to walk over water.%nDouble Jump allows you to jump while in the air to jump again.%nLead Boots allows you to walk under water, prevents you from swimming, and may cause excessive Blub. Bring along potions of water breathing.%nSlimy Shoes reduces fall damage.%n%nHint:%nAutorepair can be added to the shoes as well.%nEvery Armor part has 3 Slots for modification.

# Quest: Witchery Seeds
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGA.name=Witchery Seeds
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGA.desc=To get Witchery seeds, use a hoe on grass blocks away from water. To open the rest of the questline, you will need to do Thaumcraft quests and research the Witchery tab in the Thaumonomicon.%n%nAccording to legend, when the root of the Mandrake plant is dug up it screams and kills all who hear it. This is only partially true. A fully grown Mandrake may scream causing immense discomfort to those around. This is why it is best to harvest the Mandrake root at night when the plant is more likely to be dormant. The fully grown Mandrake can be harvested to obtain more Mandrake seeds and a Mandrake.%n%nBreaking a fully grown Mandrake plant will either yield Mandrake Root or the Mandrake may awaken and cause all sorts of mischief (and pain to the ears!).%n%nBelladonna seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage belladonna plant. The fully grown belladonna plant can be harvested to obtain more Belladonna seeds and a Belladonna flower.%n%nSnowbell seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage snowbell plant. The fully grown snowbell plant can be harvested to obtain more Snowbell seeds, snowballs and occasionally an Icy Needle.%n%nWater Artichoke seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Water Artichoke plant. The fully grown Water Artichoke plant can be harvested to obtain more Water Artichoke seeds and a Water Artichoke Globe.%n%nWater Artichoke seeds can only be planted on water source blocks.%n%nGarlic is a plantable crop that can be used to make tasty food, and to deal with vampires. It may be planted on tilled farm land, and will grow in five stages. When full grown the plant may be harvested for up to three dropped garlic bulbs. Which may either be replanted, or used in a crafting recipe.%n%nGarlic bulbs can be used to make meaty stew, a particularly nourishing meal. It is also the main ingredient in making a Garlic Garland, a useful tool in warding off vampires. Finally, garlic can be used by witches in a Witches' Cauldron to make a vampire Weakening brew, and by Witch Hunters, to make vampire resistant armor.%n%nWolfsbane seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Wolfsbane plant. The fully grown Wolfsbane plant can be harvested to obtain more Wolfsbane seeds and the Wolfsbane flower.

# Quest: Cable Diodes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHQ.name=§5§lCable Diodes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHQ.desc=Sometimes you just need a Diode, either to prevent burning up cables when splitting off a main line, or on a Thermos Server's chunk borders. Make one 4A Diode and get a 2A one for free!

# Quest: Mushroom Biomes? Why Are There So Many?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHKg.name=§1§lMushroom Biomes? Why Are There So Many?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHKg.desc=The GTNH pack is made for the Realistic World Generator (RWG).%n%nIf your setup uses the vanilla-biomes worldgen, you will get huge Mushroom biomes over the map. If you have this problem, please generate a new world with the RWG.%n%nIf you met this problem on a server, put "level-type=rwg" into the server.properties file and generate a new world.

# Quest: Moron's Manual for Massacring Monsters
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMQ.name=§1§lMoron's Manual for Massacring Monsters
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMQ.desc=If you haven't noticed, this world is a true hellscape full of Special Mobs and Infernals around every corner. Unlike in vanilla, a player has to actually stay aware and pay attention to what they are fighting. Here are some tips.%n%nIf an infernal has Vengeance, don't shoot it with your 56-damage crossbow!%n%nA high health infernal with regeneration is hard to kill. Even worse if it is a witch that can also heal herself. In those cases, run like hell, or bring a soul vial to capture it and throw it into Mount Doom.%n%nWatch out for zombies with fishing poles - they can pull you to them. And zombies with a bow and arrow - they can shoot you back!

# Quest: Moron's Manual for Effective EBFing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHPQ.name=§6§lMoron's Manual for Effective EBFing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHPQ.desc=Welcome to the latest Moron's Manual, Effective EBFing! This manual covers common problems encountered when using the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace.%n%nSetup%nWhen setting up your EBF, make sure to place it a few chunks away from things pollution affects, like farmland. Pollution is nobody's friend!%n%nDuring setup, make sure the center of the EBF is hollow. Sometimes things can sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft light orb!%n%nMake sure your muffler faces §lout§r, not §lin§r. The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those delightful odors!%n%nWhen placing your power hatches, make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF. Especially at LV, those few blocks make a big difference! Every amp of energy traveling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to get longer running time until you get stable power.%n%nOutput hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and inventories placed next to them such as chests or BC tanks. They will also void if they're full, so keep an eye on them!%n%nWhen building multiple EBFs, the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace can share walls. This can save you on input and output hatches too. Not recommended for energy and maintenance hatches!

# Quest: Circuit Programming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH_w.name=§5§lCircuit Programming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH_w.desc=Some machines have a very, very large number of recipes. To avoid conflicts, many recipes have programmed circuits to ensure that the correct recipe is used. These programmed circuits are not consumed.%n%nIn this modpack, all singleblock GT machines now come with an icon in the GUI on the bottom-right that represents a ghost circuit. Click it or scroll to choose the number you need. If you do that, you don't have to insert a physical circuit. This is going to be your main option for all single block machines. This option is now also available for input buses of multiblocks, which you will use much later.%n%nThere are a few places throughout the modpack where you still need the physical circuits. You can turn an LV circuit into a programmed circuit in the crafting grid and then program it in various ways:%n%n1) Find a correct crafting recipe with a screwdriver in NEI and use that.%n%n2) Right-click while holding the programmed circuit to open an easy menu. You still need to at least have the screwdriver in your inventory though or it won't work. Eventually you can also make an electric screwdriver.%n%n3) Use the BartWorks Circuit Programmer. It's only available in MV, but it does not use any durability and runs on EU.%n%n4) Use the GT++ Circuit Programmer block. It isn't portable and only available in MV, but it allows for automation.%n%n%nThe tasks in this quest are just the showcase of what programming circuits there are. You can just click the checkmark once you understand how the programmed circuits work.

# Quest: Double the Fun
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHaw.name=§a§lDouble the Fun
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHaw.desc=Need even more power? Why not combine rods? Produces more power (NOT double, it varies per rod type) and more heat (again NOT double) but only uses up one slot. You need more complex designs to handle them, but you were ready for that, right?%n%nSo how about doubling your doubling to double your double (4x)? Quad rods put out even more power and heat, expect all the other rods to work similarly (for the most part).

# Quest: Unfortunately, There's No Depleted Uranium Bullets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHbA.name=§a§lUnfortunately, There's No Depleted Uranium Bullets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHbA.desc=After your rods have finished their cycle they turn into depleted rods. You can then thermal centrifuge them to get some materials back. Depending on the rod, you can get different stuff, see NEI or the wiki for details.

# Quest: No Boom Tomorrow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHbg.name=§a§lNo Boom Tomorrow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHbg.desc=With a nuke, you can cause some real catastrophic damage to your base. You can either place it 20 chunks away, or surround it with blast proof materials.%n%nFused Quartz is no good now, forget about it ok? Instead, use the GTNH approved Plated Reinforced Stone series! Or one of the other options I guess, like Warded Glass. You may need multiple layers depending on your reactor, try it out in creative. Remember you must close in the corners - blasts can slip through the cracks. To get power out, do right angle turns on the wires as blasts go in a straight line.%n%n[note]There are 6 of them, use NEI.[/note]%n%n[note]Okay, okay, you don't have to forget Fused Quartz, I'll give you some. Maybe you can stop rain with it.[/note]

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHhg.desc=Are you ready for a longer trip? With your new lunch box, saddle, lead and of course a horse, we can start a small journey. Be sure to make paths over water, horses don't like going through deep water. If you get unseated in deep water, you can try getting on repeatedly and moving a small distance each time, this may be faster for small rivers. You can also try jumping over the deep parts if it isn't that big.%n%nIf you are playing single player or a local server, horses make a great way to get around. On non-local servers they can cause problems and desync if you have poor internet, or if the server doesn't have good TPS. Like all the official servers.%n%nYou can tie the lead to your horse and the fence to get it to stick around while you investigate something.

# Quest: Safety First
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIcQ.name=§3§lSafety First
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIcQ.desc=For those new to GregTech, here are some tips and warnings about electricity.%n%nMachines don't like being out in the rain, and will start fires nearby. Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier causes an explosion. Or several, if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.%n%nSending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a cable does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.%n%nA generator that supplies 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than the full voltage. For example, macerators processing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run several from a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. Why does that matter? Because there's loss for every amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are better than wires. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.%n%nMost machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't receive most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding on cables.%n%nSome machines are specifically there to help you deal with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers, and diodes. Check out the quest tab Storing and Transforming EU for more on those.%n%nIf you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV and LV have their own lossless cables). You can use laser hatches much later to send even more. There even are wireless options, but not right now.%n%nA single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.%n%nNote that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ (tier-1) per amp. So 1 EU at LV, 2 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of your power. You have to be careful with losses when making your first EBF later in LV, maybe rather power them directly? Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up over longer distances, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes less of something to worry about.%n%nIf this info isn't enough for you, head on over to [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Electricity[/url] to read more.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIoQ.name=Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIoQ.desc=First off, don't be scared by the massive amounts of bees you see here once you unlock the breeding trees. There's even more that aren't included and you'll need NEI to find!%n%nHa ha, just kidding - don't panic! The breeding lines unlock bit by bit showing you what you can go for next, mostly from the top to the bottom. The large icons represent particularly powerful bees. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown on the Bee Breeding Tree.%n%nBees have two sets of traits, active and inactive. The active one affects the behavior of the bee while the inactive one is only relevant for breeding.%n%nA trait can be [warn]Dominant[/warn] or §9Recessive§r. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the desired traits. You can breed the ones with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. A Field Kit or GT scanner cannot see passive traits, you need a Beealyzer for that.%n%nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee - a bee that has little to no crossbreeding potential but has all the traits you want - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility, and so on. Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.%n%nWhen you are trying to get new species, what you want is a drone - this way you can use your "breeding stock" princess with the drone to get new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poorly crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good to swap traits because they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let them live longer.%n%nOnce you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die, but they can become Ignoble under certain circumstances like using tons of production frames. Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits, and there's a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect them with that.%n%nOnce you get a new species, it will replace either all Active or Inactive traits. If the mutation happens twice at the same bee, it will replace both sets. For example, when you get a Cultivated bee, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated. Most effects are useless, so you can disregard them.%n%nAll quests require purebred species. Purebred means that the inactive species-trait is the same as the active one.%n%nAll traits can be bred into any bee species, aside from the species itself. Species also determines the preferred temperature and humidity, as well as drops. Species require their preferred temperature and humidity to be in the 'jubilant' state and produce their special drops. You can also mimic this with the alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT with tolerances.%n%nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances or lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However, the excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for a pristine princess to become ignoble.%n%nIt looks complex, because it is! But it's also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!

# Quest: Basic Bee Stats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIow.name=Basic Bee Stats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIow.desc=There are a couple of basic bees that have good stats you want to breed into your breeding stock.%n%nCave Dwelling - Rocky - This lets you put the bee housing underneath or inside. Handy for putting a chest on top for products.%n%nNocturnal - Rocky - This keeps your bees working all night long, and in the dark.%n%nRain Tolerant - Water - Keep producing even when it is raining.%n%nHigh Fertility - Wintry - For breeding purposes, you want the maximum number of drones produced.%n%nKeep in mind that specialty products from bees require the Jubilant state.%nTo be in this state, a bee needs to have its naturally preferred humidity and temperature. Just being able to work due to tolerance traits is not enough.%n%nFor example, a Salt bee needs Warm/Normal climate. Even if it has +- humidity and temp, it will not produce its Salt comb unless it is in a Warm/Normal climate. Use Alveary upgrades to make sure it is in its preferred temp/humidity.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJZA.desc=You can hunt endermen the Vanilla way to get a chance at Ender Pearls, you can purchase Endermen spawn eggs, or try your luck in the End.%n%nOr you can get cruel, and stuff one into a smeltery to melt it down into delicious Liquid Ender and cast pearls from it.%n%nYou monster.%n%nSome of the dungeons have Spawner of Enderman, so you can do whatever you want with it.%n%nTo prevent endermen from teleporting, make sure to cover the smeltery so they don't see the sky.%n%nIf you manage to put a regenerating endermen in there, tag it so it doesn't despawn, and make sure your smeltery is not in a claimed chunk on a server.

# Quest: Numbers in the Corner?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJZg.name=§1§lNumbers in the Corner?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJZg.desc=What's with the numbers in the corner? That is the In-Game Info (IGI) mod. Some of the info it gives is useful right away, some of it shines later on in progression.%n%nFor now, the most important thing it does is showing if you are in an ore chunk. Further quests will explain what it means.%n%nIf you want to hide it, type "/igi disable" in the chat. Type "/igi enable" if you want to turn it back on.%n%nThe command "/igi config" opens the configuration window to control its position, scale, and size.%n%nThe command "/xu_tps" from the mod Extra Utilities toggles numbers to measure ticktime in milliseconds and the TPS (Ticks Per Second). TPS is a measure of how well your server is running. The ideal TPS is 20.00 (meaning a ticktime of at most 50.00). If your TPS is less than 15, things are going to start lagging noticeably. At 10 or less TPS, it is going to be hard to play.%nThe tooltip shows three types of measurement: instantaneous, average, and worst-case. Each one first shows the ticktime and then the TPS in brackets.%n%nIf you need suggestions on solving TPS problems, feel free to ask for help in the GTNH Discord.%n%nWhile GTNH comes with recommended default settings, in particular when it comes to balance, there are many commands and configurations to customize your experience. They range from accessibility or debug tools to visual customization all the way to various cheats. You can find a small overview on [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Commands_and_Configurations[/url].

# Quest: Bringing the Biome to You
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJbw.name=Bringing the Biome to You
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJbw.desc=So maybe you can't find a swamp or tropical forest for your crops or bees, or maybe they're too far away so they're inconvenient to get to, or maybe your base is in a colder climate and you have to deal with the howls of direwolves constantly. Instead of packing up all your stuff and moving somewhere else, why not try changing the biome?

# Quest: Transform and...Stay Put Actually
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKqw.name=Transform and...Stay Put Actually
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKqw.desc=Active Transformers will transform power up or down at only a 0.004%% power loss, making using several in a row obsolete, if you can afford it. Unfortunately, it's kinda expensive. On the other hand, you can use it to turn your lasers from your laser hatches, which is probably a better use.%n%nIt doesn't need a Maintenance Hatch, just the I/O Hatches.

# Quest: Dyson Swarm Ground Unit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL3w.name=Dyson Swarm Ground Unit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL3w.desc=The Dyson Swarm Ground Unit multiblock is basically a solar panel, you just insert Dyson Swarm Modules (how many depends on how much energy you want) and get energy out. There are some complications though:%n- Each hour, n of m modules are destroyed according to this formula: n = m (2 * 0.066) / (exp(-0.00005 * (m - 1))+exp(0.00003 * cps)), where cps is computation per second,%n- Needs 3.6M L/h of Gelid Cryotheum.%n- Up to 10,000 modules can be inserted into a single Dyson Swarm.%n- Dyson Swarm can only accept up to 100k computation.%n%n[note]Note: TecTech's Multi-Amp Dynamo Hatches and Laser Source Hatches are supported.[/note]%n%nThe amount of each part on the right is only the minimum, depending on how many Dynamo Hatches, Input Buses, Input Hatches and Optical Reception Connectors you use, you may need more Energy Receiver Base Casings, Module Deployment Unit Base Casings or Control Center Base Casings.%n%n[warn]This machine will explode if Dynamo buffer is full![/warn]%n%nFun fact: The maximum output is 337B EU/t (limited by 10,000 Modules and the 3.37x dimension bonus of Horus)%n%n(If you don't want to calculate how many modules you need per hour, the number is 64 for max stats)

# Quest: Here's Some Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqg.name=Here's Some Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqg.desc=[note]Here the oil questlines diverge into two tabs - part about getting every possible output is in the LV tab, part about the usefulness of oil is in the Working with Oil tab, this quest is part of the latter.[/note]%n%nWelcome! This is the questline that shows the path through oil processing towards all the useful items and fluids that can be obtained from it. Working with this black liquid involves a lot of steps that range from LV (Low Voltage), all the way to IV (Insane Voltage), and outputs that are useful at those tiers and beyond.%n%nOil is useful both for generating power, and to automate a lot of chemicals that are important for progression. As you progress, you will be able to get more of it, and get it faster, as well as process it in new ways that improve on the setup that you were using before. It is not a required path for progression in the pack, but it is a very useful one, should you choose to follow it.%n%nThe best way to start working with oil is to extract it from the surface. Oil spouts are visible without having to dig down, and they can be interacted with by using a Pump placed above them, alongside a generator that feeds it some power. You can use some of the Oil to generate this power for now.

# Quest: Nano Forge Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0A.name=Nano Forge Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0A.desc=Carbon Nanites are good first workers, but they don't have much in the way of working with more complex systems as they have a very basic nanite network. So a new more advanced nanite will be needed to produce complex nanites.%n%nThe neutronium nanite is an in-between of the two tiers able to produce tier 2 nanites, which have other uses.%n%n[note]When putting the neutronium nanite in the controller, you will need to wait for the structure check to happen again or break and replace the controller with a neutronium nanite inside. Allows the Nano Forge to make tier 2 nanites.[/note]

# Quest: Nano Forge Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0Q.name=Nano Forge Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0Q.desc=Neutronium nanites are slow moving, but that allowed them to have a complex nanite network. If there was a material that could move itself it could allow for an even more complex nanite with great speeds... Thankfully with the DTPF fully functional we can make it, transcendent metal.%n%n[note]Same thing as the neutronium nanite, but this nanite allows for tier 3 nanites to be made in the nano forge.[/note]

# Quest: Chemical Pseudo-Altercations
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM1w.name=Chemical Pseudo-Altercations
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM1w.desc=Learning more about the world and its ways is a sign of wisdom. However, the truly wise are the ones who know what is unimportant and can be skipped. For a true breacher of technology, the constraints of physics and chemistry are not essential. To skip past their technicalities, the Quantum Force Transformer comes into play.%n%nThis multi is meant to replicate the most popular and important processing lines in the pack's progression, mostly those related to chemistry. Because of recursion in recipes, where earlier tier materials are required to craft higher tier equivalents, there are a lot of early processing lines that stay up through progression. Even worse, they often need more and more machines to keep up with increasing speed demands. To save on lag, this multi will do those processing lines in one step and without most of the extra chemicals that are added to purify the inputs into the outputs.%n%nThe Quantum Force Transformer (QFT) is unlocked in UEV, after Optical Mainframes have been crafted, and with the addition of a single Eternal Singularity and other materials. It's a tall, 15x15 multiblock with many different casings, including two that are upgradable and decide the two tiers of the multi. Although it's available in UEV, the upgraded casings require more and more expensive materials, while also unlocking skips for more advanced processing lines. For example, a platline skip can be done in the earliest QFT tier, whereas a Kevlar skip can only be done in the last tier.%n%nEach recipe that the QFT has represents a single processing line or a big part of a line. The inputs for the early plastic skip, for example, are the basic components of the plastics on a molecular level (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc.), and not the multi-step chemicals that were used half a dozen tiers earlier. All recipes have 3 or more outputs, and every output has a chance to appear: the chance for each is 100%% divided by the number of outputs. To increase it, there are additional mechanics that can be used.%n%nSimply put, the QFT uses huge amounts of energy and quantum field stabilization to disassemble simple molecules and assemble them into more complex ones, without needing additives or constrained processes. The only addition to the base inputs that the multi requires is a specific catalyst, which the smart circuits use to guide the materials into what they ultimately transform into, but they are never consumed or lost in any way.%n%nThis direct process simplifies long processing chains to one step, but it has two consequences: it makes the process expensive, given the extreme conditions needed to undergo the transformation (in a similar way to fusion), but it also generates many different outputs at once, none of which are guaranteed, and it's impossible to choose between them without adding something else into the setup to alter the conditions inside the QFT in some way. Throwing more energy into the multi won't do anything, and better materials don't seem to work, so what is the next step? That is what the next two quests will answer.%n%n[note]Tip: Use multiple Bulk Catalyst Housings to run additional QFT recipes within the same structure[/note]

# Quest: Precise Assembler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEg.name=Precise Assembler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEg.desc=Precise Assembler has two modes: Precise mode and Normal mode.%n%nPrecise mode is used to make some of the advanced components from Good Generator mod.%n%n[note]As name suggests your current casings lack precision to produce these advanced components.%nYou will need at least MK-1 casings for this mode to work.[/note]%n%nNormal mode works as multiblock version of Assembler.%n%n[note]You can't skip tiers with this. You need singleblock Assembler or GT++ multi to make your first Energy Hatch, then you can use it for Precise Assembler.[/note]

# Quest: Bet On The Distillus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQQ.name=Bet On The Distillus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQQ.desc=IV brings forth GT++ multis, including an upgrade for the Distillation Tower, called the Dangote Distillus. In structure, it's exactly the same as the DT, but it uses a different controller that has a more complicated recipe. It needs more expensive items, and it's also locked to an IV Chemical Plant, which makes it a very expensive craft if it is the only use you have for that plant.%n%nThat said, it solves the issue of DTs being slow, and those are essentially the backbone of all of these renewable setups. How many quad DTs are you going to need for reliable IV/LuV power, I might ask? Just go for it.

# Quest: Faster Crops

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMRg.desc=Welcome to my ted talk, today we talk about the §6§lExtreme Industrial Greenhouse.%n§rIt is the most advanced and §l§nLAG FREE§r crop farm that will allow you to supply the amount of tea you need.%nThe machine starts at §5EV§r, but to farm IC2 crops you will need at least §dLuV§r power.%nTo see the structure, place the controller on ground and use a structure hologram to build.%nThe glass tier limits the energy tier until [note]UV[/note]. With [note]UV[/note] glass you can have an energy tier as high as you want.%nShift-click with screwdriver to change crop type (IC2/normal), sadly you can't farm both in one machine.%nThere are 3 modes to manage your crops (change with screwdriver):%n%n§lSetup mode (input):%n§rIn this mode you can plant your crops in the machine.%nJust put them in the input bus and enable the machine with a soft mallet.%nAdditionally, you need to insert block that is required for IC2 crop to grow (if any)%nWhen the bus is empty, just disable it and change the mode.%nKeep in mind that there is limited space of slots for your crops depending on the voltage.%nWith normal crops you start with 1 slot and that multiplies by 2 every tier past §5EV§r, every slot can take 64 crops of the same type.%nWith IC2 crops you start with 4 slots and that multiplies by 4 every tier past §dLuV§r, every slot can take only 1 crop.%n%n§lSetup mode (output):%n§rThis mode allows you to move your Greenhouse or upgrade your crops.%nWhen the machine is running in this mode it will output all planted crops in the output bus.%n%n§lNormal operation:%n§rWith normal crops it is a straightforward process. Base processing time is 5 seconds, at the end of operation all crops are grown and the outputs are added to the output bus. Additionally the time is lower every tier past §5EV§r §o(The time is divided by the number of tiers past §6HV§r§o, minimum 1 second. WOW)§r%n%nIC2 crops on the other hand, are not that easy. They are normally simulated, but accelerated 32 times. Process time is 5 seconds. You can check the progress of the growing process with a tricorder.%n%nIf you want to grow your crops even faster, then you can use a fertilizer (up to §l400%% more drops§r !). Machine will take fertilizer from the input buses on start of the operation and will be applied to that operation only. Each fertilizer gives +200%% per crop in normal mode or +10%% in IC2 mode. The bonus is applied evenly on crops. Examples:%nNormal mode, 3 wheat seeds, 1 tea seeds, you insert 1 fertilizer, you will get +150%% wheat drops and +50%% tea drops.%nIC2 mode, 16 melon seed bags, you insert 64 fertilizer, you will get +40%% drops.%n%nAdditionally, all your crops need water to grow. Every single crop drinks 1000L per operation. So for example if you have planted 576 tea seeds at [note]UV[/note] voltage you will need 576000 L per second.%n%n§lLast notes:%n§rThe animation can't be disabled.%nThe lamps can be inverted.%nThe dirt must be tilled.%nIf you encounter any issue or have any suggestion please open an issue on GitHub and ping §l@kuba6000§r.%nThis MB was created to farm tea because I wanted to.

# Quest: UV Power Per Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXQ.name=UV Power Per Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXQ.desc=Once you progress enough in ZPM to make ZPM Dynamo Hatches, you can increase each turbine's output to 524,288 EU/t. At this number, you'll be a lot less limited by the turbine material, and it's possible to increase the total power output of one Fusion Reactor considerably. You can cover the total Helium Plasma output from one reactor with 3 Plasma Turbines, if you choose the right materials:%n%nLarge High Durability Compound Steel 235%% 473,759 EU/t%nLarge Atomic Separation Catalyst 206%% 409,663 EU/t%nLarge Adamantium 206%% 413,280 EU/t%nLarge Draconium 175%% 220,500 EU/t (durable)%nLarge Neutronium 165%% 249,480 EU/t (very durable)%n%nThe power output and final efficiency can vary a lot, based on which turbines you're using. Some of them, like Ichorium and Neutronium, last basically forever, while others will need to be replaced from time to time but offer higher efficiency. If you want to get more power per turbine, to reach closer to the dynamo's limit, you can increase the flow of plasma to the turbine, but be careful! You can't go beyond the dynamo's limit, and you will also lose efficiency as you increase the flow amount. More concrete values for efficiency loss can be found in the Plasma Turbine quest in the LuV page.%n%nMake a normal or buffered ZPM dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest: High Temperature Super Breeder
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbg.name=§6§6§6§lHigh Temperature Super Breeder
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbg.desc=Have you heard of pebble reactors?%n%nIt's called the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR), and it uses fuel pebbles and consumes power. However, it doesn't really make a lot of power, and doesn't even match the EU/t of THTR, despite being much more expensive. The multiblock structure is basically the same, a huge reactor around 12x12x12 blocks in size, with 500+ casings made with Europium. What it doesn't make in power, it compensates in breeding, however.%n%nFor the unaware, this is expensive. Pebble reactors work by stuffing the reactor absolutely full of pebbles, and then the reaction will keep going for, essentially, forever. In this case, you will have a fully automated source of almost endless Lutetium, Plutonium and other things that will be explained in the following quests, alongside the production of fuel and the processing of outputs. What this means is that this is an expensive multiblock, but it's placed at a tier in which this expense is actually reasonable, if there is a need for immense, endless breeding of many outputs.%n%nIf you're on the fence about building this, check the next quests to learn more about the fuel and outputs.%n%nNotes:%n%nHTGR has an internal buffer for fuel and only one input bus is required (any will do), as well as only one output bus (reactor automatically compresses every 64 burned pellets into one ball, so you need 6 slots or more to avoid problems with voiding at full capacity).%n%nReactor requires only 72k out of 720k pebbles to operate, but running at minimum capacity means that you will not get any bonuses, such as lower recipe time and higher amount of pebbles processed per cycle.%n%nThis multi consumes 1A LuV when operating, no matter how many pebbles are inside, but it also generates Hot Coolant as it runs. If you use it to generate power, you will gain more EU than is consumed by the reactor.%n%nIn this reactor, the throughput increases with the amount of pebbles put into it.%n%nBy typing HTGR in NEI, you can see all the items that are related to this multiblock.

# Quest: Two Million Turbines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcw.name=Two Million Turbines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcw.desc=Hopefully, not more than a handful. The objective here is for each of them to output close to 2 million EU/t.%n%nHow can you get there? Look at the UV Dynamo Hatch's recipe and you have your new objective. When you arrive there, each turbine that is equipped with that impressive block will be able to output up to 2,097,152 EU/t, which again opens you up to new turbine opportunities. Some good choices at this point are as follows:%n%nLarge Cosmic Neutronium 225%% 1,360,800 EU/t%nLarge Ichorium 225%% 1,360,800 EU/t (very durable)%nLarge Awakened Draconium 195%% 491,400 EU/t%nLarge Trinium 185%% 1,451,840 EU/t%n%nAt this point, you might consider building more t1 Fusion Reactors to process other materials. Even if you stop the reactor you're using to generate this plasma, the EU cost of restarting it is less than 1 bucket of plasma, so it's probably not that big of a deal.%n%nMake a normal or buffered UV dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest: Infinite Turbines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMeA.name=Infinite Turbines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMeA.desc=Some turbine materials are not available for you, either because you don't have the material itself or because the Dynamo Hatch in the turbine cannot handle the power output from plasma. It will be a different story in UHV, when you can once again quadruple the max output of each turbine, and also unlock Infinity as an option for turbines.%n%nHuge Infinity 300%% 6,451,200 EU/t%nHuge Infinity Catalyst 231%% 1,236,480 EU/t%n%nYes, that's basically it. You can use any material from the previous turbine quests, but when you make the t8 rocket and can mine Infinity Catalyst, these are the two options. Obviously, Infinity is much better, but also much more expensive. If you stick with fusion, you will need several of those to push through the endgame. Remember that you can input plasma beyond the optimal flow, and get more out of each turbine at the cost of fuel efficiency.%n%nMake a normal or buffered UHV dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest: Gas Planets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMiQ.name=Gas Planets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMiQ.desc=You probably also want a good overview of what you can get with your Planetary Gas Siphon, and the tiers of the gas giants. So here we go:%n%nJupiter (Tier 3)%n1 Hydrogen - 15000 L/s%n2 Helium - 500 L/s%n3 Nitrogen - 300 L/s%n4 Oxygen - 200 L/s%n%nSaturn (Tier 5)%n1 Hydrogen - 18000 L/s%n2 Helium - 800 L/s%n3 Oxygen - 500 L/s%n4 Liquid Oxygen - 150 L/s%n%nUranus (Tier 5)%n1 Deuterium - 5000 L/s%n2 Neon - 450 L/s%n3 Argon - 250 L/s%n4 Krypton - 100 L/s%n%nNeptune (Tier 6)%n1 Tritium - 3000 L/s%n2 Helium-3 - 500 L/s%n3 Ammonia - 400 L/s%n4 Xenon - 350 L/s

# Quest: Hypogen Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkg.name=§6§lHypogen Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkg.desc=Forged from the blood of an ageless dragon, and melded together by the power of fusion beyond what you thought was the reality. No natural element, or combination of elements, could match up to this glowing orange material, not even the Awakened Draconium you got your hands on before.%n%nWhat truly happened inside that Mk4 Fusion Reactor? What §ois§o§r this material? Its dust pulsates visibly, at different rates depending on the size of the dust itself. Hypogen approaches a state of complete balance as it approaches the block size, and it is obvious to you what needs to be done with it.%n%nIt absorbs and radiates energy without any effort, but it would be stupid to attempt making coils out of this without assistance. Wetware wasn't good enough anymore, and only the most advanced living circuit could withstand the erratic behavior Hypogen demonstrates.%n%nProvides 12601K heat. Almost certainly, this will end up on your DTPF.

# Quest: Eternal Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkw.name=§6§lEternal Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkw.desc=Beyond spacetime, beyond reality. You have peered into what never existed and brought into a fluid, and then a solid. It has been stabilized, against all odds. When you look at it, you think that you could hold the entire universe in your hand.%n%nIn the past, you were able to combine almost all materials into one, through an Eternal Singularity, an infinitely dense sample of the universe. However, automating this at the scale of the DTPF proved ridiculous, which would have stopped your progress altogether if not for the discovery of the Energized Tesseract. To physically manifest spacetime itself, you first needed to manifest the fourth spatial dimension, and that is what the Tesseract is: a 4-dimensional cube.%n%nCubes! Almost everything around you is made out of cubes. You have only glimpsed at the reality of the 4-dimensional world, but you have successfully used it to condensate spacetime, which can be arbitrarily molded into the complete Eternal mixture, a process that unfortunately cannot be reversed. Needless to say, living circuits will not suffice to maintain an infinitely dense, infinitely stable, multi-dimensional material.%n%nCurrently, the final upgrade with 13501K. This really makes your DTPF shine!

# Quest: Power in the Ether
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMow.name=Power in the Ether
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMow.desc=These new hatches allow you to wirelessly send, store and receive energy from any location in any dimension. They can be placed in any existing multi block structure and will function as normal energy/dynamo hatches. A dynamo hatch will consume EU and store it in a global network linked to your user. The wireless network can store a total of 2^(2^31) EU, far exceeding even a max tier LSC.%n%nYou can share a wireless network with others by adding them to your network with /gt global_energy_join user1 user2. This will make user1 use user2's energy when interacting with the global network. You can leave a network at any time by doing /gt global_energy_join your_name your_name.%n%nYou cannot connect wires to these blocks. These are also designed to be highly lag efficient, meaning EU is added at large intervals to prevent needless calculations from occurring. This will also save you some TPS lag from vast wire networks.%n%n[note]If your calculator is giving up, 2^(2^31) is a number with 646,456,994 digits.[/note]

# Quest: PCB Factory
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMyQ.name=PCB Factory
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMyQ.desc=All those boards made in a chemical reactor. It's time to stop that, there must be a more efficient way to make them. After a couple days of research I have found one, a factory designed to print out circuit boards.%n%nThe PCB Factory is able to use a wide range of plastics to create circuit boards ready to be used. The printing mechanism overheats when it tries to overclock currently, so I will have to find a way to make that work later. Boards with neurons on them will also take a bit before they can be made, but it won't be hard to achieve.%n%n§2Trace size: the trace size represents the lines between components, which are needed to transmit the electrical signals on the circuit. One can make it smaller to slow down the machine, but use less resources, or make it bigger to make it faster, but use more resources.%n%n§1Formulas:%n- 10000/(TraceSize/100) Production%n- RecipeDuration/TraceSize^2 Time%n%n§2Using the GUI, the player can go to the configuration menu. There they can change the trace size or add new parts to the multiblock. One can also change where they are placed around the multiblock.§r%n%n[note]Make sure to set the configuration you want before using the structure lib blueprint for autobuild.[/note]

# Quest: Bio Chamber
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMyg.name=Bio Chamber
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMyg.desc=As I got new technologies, I have seen the need to make a chamber where the circuit board can contain neurons for the wetware boards or the upcoming bioware boards.%n%nThe Bio Chamber is a simple upgrade, it doesn't require many resources. Don't know why I didn't make it earlier.%n%n[note]It can use any glass.[/note]

# Quest: Liquid Cooling Tower
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMyw.name=Liquid Cooling Tower
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMyw.desc=I have started to hit the limit of the multiblock without overclocking it, so I decided to give it a liquid cooling tower. This will allow it to overclock like every other multi with 2x Speed and 4x EU/t.%n%nI will need to provide some distilled water to its hatch to absorb any excess heat.%n%n[note]The Liquid Cooling Tower allows the Multiblock to have 2/4 OC at the cost of 10L/s of distilled water when running. The input hatch is placed in the bottom center of the Liquid Cooling Tower.[/note]

# Quest: PCB Factory Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzA.name=PCB Factory Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzA.desc=With the Nano Forge built, we can upgrade our production of circuit boards for free, but the nanites need a container to hold them. The current casings aren't enough, we need to find an alternative casing.%n%nAfter some research, infinity as a frame and enriched holmium as the protection layer seems to work well. It can be allowed to let through nanites to go into the printer base so that extra material can be directly removed instead of trying to go slower.%n%n[note]Allows the player to use the tier 2 recipes with the use of a silver nanite in the input bus. This also unlocks parallels of the PCB Factory with said formula: Log2(x) parallels, where x is the amount of nanites in the input bus.[/note]

# Quest: Thermosink Radiator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzQ.name=Thermosink Radiator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzQ.desc=With the control of spacetime you have achieved and its 0K temperature it would be possible to make an even better cooling unit. A casing able to keep its room temperature very low and nanites which can transfer heat effectively because of their small bodies. This doesn't quite work and some coolant is still needed, but water freezes at those temperatures so super coolant will be our choice.%n%n[note]The Thermosink Radiator allows for 4/4 OC making it possible to speed through recipes. It requires 10/s of super coolant in its hatch, it's in the same place as the Liquid Cooling Tower.[/note]%n%n[warn]This upgrade is incompatible with its lower tier predecessor.[/warn]

# Quest: PCB Factory Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzg.name=PCB Factory Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzg.desc=Why use a small nozzle to print out the conductor on the board when one can just build it using nanites? Well the silver nanite isn't rigid enough for that so a new nanite will be needed... and so will new casings. Heard that celestial tungsten is a good candidate for a frame. Quantum can be used for the protection as these nanites will be forever flying around inside.%n%nThe structure will need to change as it needs to be a bit bigger and taller.%n%n[note]Works the same as the Tier 2 in most cases, but allows the player to use even less resources by using a gold nanite.[/note]

# Quest: Nano Forge Tier 1
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzw.name=Nano Forge Tier 1
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzw.desc=There must be a way to make a nano scale robots to work in a machine. Carbon ones can be made in an assembly line, but very inefficiently. There must be a better way.%n%nWhat about a Nano Forge, able to cut up blocks into nano-thin sheets and then creating the first nanite, which helps create thousands of them in mere seconds.%n%n[note]The Nano Forge is a big multiblock requiring lots of power over the course of a couple minutes. It is able to use TT energy hatches (including lasers). The controller must have a carbon nanite inside to make tier 1 recipes.[/note]%n%n[note]Despite what NEI might claim there are no minimum voltages for the Nano Forge recipes. If you want to do a recipe you just have to achieve the minimum EU/t required, no matter the voltage[/note].

# Quest: Compact Storage
betterquesting.quest.QNsm_wc0QO2g9C6_-vj2fA.name=§2§lCompact Storage
betterquesting.quest.QNsm_wc0QO2g9C6_-vj2fA.desc=Now that you are starting to find more and more copper, you feel your wood chests are too small to hold all the stuff.%n%n[note]It's time to upgrade your wooden chests to copper chests! Higher tiers of chests can be upgraded cheaply by using upgrade items, but not all tier chests can be upgraded directly this way. You can also try the "Wood to Copper Chest Upgrade", but upgrading from wood to a tiered chest will not be any cheaper.[/note]%n%n[note]Upgraded chests cannot be connected into double chests.[/note]

# Quest: Steel Chest?
betterquesting.quest.V4jinTYRSueIrEqn90dRzQ.name=§3§lSteel Chest?
betterquesting.quest.V4jinTYRSueIrEqn90dRzQ.desc=While being significantly more expensive than gold chest, the steel chest has less capacity but it can be used in some specialized crafting recipes.

# Quest: Multiblock Revolution
betterquesting.quest.hEsmeH74S4aOOrROI1AHxQ.name=§3§lMultiblock Revolution
betterquesting.quest.hEsmeH74S4aOOrROI1AHxQ.desc=The steam machines you have been using until now have served you well, but there will be a time when you need to process even more items. That's where the so-called multiblocks come in. There's a variety of steam multiblocks available to you - go have a look at the Mass Processing quest tab!%n%nThis tab introduces you to a wide range of extremely powerful multiblock machines that can replace your old, worn-out singleblocks (and some that can replace your old multiblocks!). Many of these new machines will require you to handle additional mechanics and requirements, but it will be worth it!%n%nHere are some terms you should be familiar with as you enter the world of multiblocks:%n%nOverclock (OC):%nIf a machine can handle at least 4 times the voltage that is required for a recipe, it will overclock - causing it to require 4x the EU/t but also run 2x as fast. This can happen multiple times!%n%nPerfect Overclock (Often phrased as "Does not lose efficiency when overclocked):%nSome machines conditionally (or unconditionally) perform perfect overclocks: in this case, the machine will require 4x the EU/t, but it will run 4x as fast instead, leading to both increased speed and no net increase in the total eu usage!%n%nParallel (Often phrased as "Processes x items"):%nMachines which parallel act as if they are running multiple of themselves - that is to say, they are able to perform multiple of the same recipe at the same time, using the recipe's EU/t multiplied by the number of parallels. Machines which parallel will [warn]PRIORITIZE[/warn] this behavior over overclocking, which is good for you! Parallels are more efficient.%n%n[note]When working with multiblocks, if power is interrupted during operation, your inputs will be lost forever... careful![/note]

# Quest: Dark Steel Chest
betterquesting.quest.t6xRGFm_S2SG6_-xNh8mwQ.name=§5§6§lDark Steel Chest
betterquesting.quest.t6xRGFm_S2SG6_-xNh8mwQ.desc=After embracing the dark side you get access to the new even bigger dark steel chest... perhaps another upgrade will be available in the future?%n%n[note]Just as with the previous chests you can also upgrade with a fitting upgrade item.[/note]

# Quest: Thaumometric Essentia Cell
betterquesting.quest.xdiDnTdpTgW6POwCuDlPgg.name=Thaumometric Essentia Cell
betterquesting.quest.xdiDnTdpTgW6POwCuDlPgg.desc=After meddling with the 4th Dimension, you've finally discovered a way to access its unlimited Essentia supply. The Thaumometric Essentia Cell is your tool for extracting Essentia from this boundless source—think of it as your unlimited magic credit card.%n%nUnfortunately, you must filter each type of Essentia in your Essentia Cell Workbench. If only your technology were more advanced...
