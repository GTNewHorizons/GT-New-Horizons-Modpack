### Quest Lines ###


## Quest Line: And So, It Begins
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.name=And So, It Begins
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.desc=The very first tier, tier zero. This chapter will introduce you to the basic mechanics of this modpack. Mods covered: Vanilla, Pam's Harvestcraft.

# Quest: Your First Night
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.name=§d§3§2§1§lYour First Night
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.desc=Your first task is to find food and shelter for the night. The nights in this pack are cruel because of hardcore darkness. But you will have a bed by the end of this questtab.%n%n§lYou don't need to keep this book. Use the Tilde (~) button to open quests without the book§r ...unless you changed your keybinds.%n%nIf you need some extra help or just want to hang out, feel free to visit our Discord server at §9§n[url]https://discord.gg/gtnh[/url]§r. And yes, the links are clickable! On the discord, select your tech tier in #role-select - it will help people to tailor their advice to your situation.%n%nMany GTNH topics are explained in our Wiki at §9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Main_Page[/url]§r. It does not have the same extent and structure as the Questbook, but some things are much better with pictures and tables! The wiki also has tips on extra topics like what additional mods are confirmed to work with the pack, how GTNH can be installed for modern Java or how to set up a server.%n%nAdditionally, there is a spreadsheet at §9§n[url]https://bit.ly/gtnh-datasheets[/url]§r for the info you would want a spreadsheet for.%n%nIf you play through a launcher that relies on §4CurseForge§r, be aware that it doesn't always work properly. It doesn't play well with all the custom versions of mods that this pack has. So if you have any problems, first switch to another launcher like MultiMC, Prism, or Technic. The wiki has instructions there as well. The latest version of the pack is available on the Discord channel from #announcements or with the !download command.%n%nHopefully you didn't get munched by a monster while reading this.

# Quest: Where's the Flint?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ.name=§1§lWhere's the Flint?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ.desc=As you might have noticed when collecting gravel, no Flint dropped for you. %n%nWell, there is a... recipe for that. Look up Flint in Not Enough Items (NEI) and craft some!%n%nThe search field of NEI is at the bottom of the screen when you open your inventory. The results are on the right side.

# Quest: Sticks 'n Stones
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg.name=§1§lSticks 'n Stones
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg.desc=This book has a built-in reading light, lucky you! You can read about quests while you're waiting for the night to be over, but for now, you may want to get the basics done. If it isn't dark already, go out and collect some gravel and wood. %n%nKeep in mind that you need food, so look for Pam's Harvestcraft gardens. Save some of the drops from them for seeds.%n%nMake sure to read the info-quests linked to the first quest, they have important info!

# Quest: Storage For Days
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAw.name=§1§lStorage For Days
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAw.desc=Now that you've gotten your tools and are about to go collect a bunch of stuff, it's time to make some storage for it. %nTake some of your wood, and craft a chest. You will need 4 wood, 4 planks, and 1 flint.

# Quest: Tools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQ.name=§1§lTools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQ.desc=Now that you've got a shelter and a crafting table, you should make some tools, unless you'd like to continue punching trees with your bare hands.%n%nYou should probably make the shovel first so you can get gravel for the rest more easily.

# Quest: You Reap...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABg.name=§1§lYou Reap...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABg.desc=You won't always get food rewards from the quests, so it might be a good idea to take care of that problem.%n %nAs you've crafted a hoe already, go and find some water nearby to make a field.  With this modpack you can only make farmland within range of water. Let's trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your own farm.%n%nTo get other wheat, use a hoe on grass away from water. You'll get Witchery seeds too - save those for later. %n%nStart planting a Cotton field because it's a key early-game resource.%n%nYou can also get seeds from villages, and grow the seeds from the Pam's garden food.

# Quest: ...What You Sow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABw.name=§1§l...What You Sow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABw.desc=If you, by chance, did read the previous quest and planted the carrots, then you're fine. %n%nMeanwhile, you should turn some more fruits and vegetables into seeds, and increase the size of your farm to get a steady supply of food.

# Quest: Get That Stone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA.name=§1§lGet That Stone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA.desc=Look at you, with your shiny flint pickaxe! %n%nTime to mine some cobblestone. Yay! You can even improve your dirt hut!

# Quest: Fire, Fire, Grandpa!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQ.name=§1§lFire, Fire, Grandpa!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQ.desc=Time to burn some stuff, isn't it? You can't make charcoal in it, but you sure will find some usage for it soon™.

# Quest: Rest in Pieces
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACg.name=§1§lRest in Pieces
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACg.desc=It's GLOPPing time! Go kill some pigs to gather meat. If you kill them with flint tool, they will drop cooked porkchops. Now isn't that useful!

# Quest: Fluffy and Red
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADA.name=§1§lFluffy and Red
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADA.desc=Epic quest: Kill some sheep! (And try to get some wool, for a bed, obviously...)

# Quest: SO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADQ.name=§1§lSO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADQ.desc=Sleepy time, and the end of the tutorial. %n%nCongratulations! You've built your first hideout, and you should have a steady supply of food by now. %n%nSee you again in Tier 0!

# Quest: What's That...?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADg.name=§1§lWhat's That...?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADg.desc=You've seen a lot of trees, but there are a few that look really special. You are sure that these trees are much more than just wood to build your home with or used to get charcoal. You're sure that these will be Very Important soon™.%n%nThe best place to find them is in a Magical Forest, but if you can't find one, you can try a Garden or Cherry Wood Grove. Or just randomly everywhere.%n%nIf you have trouble finding them, you can go to the Coins tab and buy them.

# Quest: Goals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABjA.name=Goals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABjA.desc=GregTech New Horizons is a long and intricate mod pack with massive amounts of custom content and over three thousand quests to guide you through it.%n%nWe recommend you set yourself small goals from tier to tier and see how far your journey takes you. %n%nThe ultimate late game goal is to craft a Stargate or two, but the recipe is outrageous, and very few players have ever done so. %n%nIf you need a big goal for your run, we suggest to aim for something less crazy. %nLike going to the moon if it's your first time playing. %nOr making and automating an Assembling Line if you have never done so. %nOr crafting the Tier 8 Rocket which is the last regular rocket and is reached in UHV. 

# Quest: Even more challenge needed?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABjQ.name=Even more challenge needed?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABjQ.desc=You have played through most of the pack a few times already? Maybe you even made a Stargate? Or are you just looking for something a bit different? Don't worry, we have a few options for you:%n%n- Play in Hardcore. Either Minecraft Hardcore, or BetterQuesting Hardcore. The latter is a bit more forgiving. Maybe this seems impossible, but people have indeed reached UEV+ in Minecraft Hardcore. Better be prepared to restart a few times. This is obviously not for everybody.%n%n- Never make a rocket. The so called §ono-rocket run§r is somewhat supported by now, you will be able to do almost everything in the pack. Use bees, crops, and blood magic meteors as your main resource production. Be warned though that such a challenge is grindy and slow. For instance, you might need to collect large amounts of aluminium gravel to get your first titanium. Or have to start breeding bees early without much technology to help.%n%n- Skyblock. Yes, really. It is also known as Garden of Grind and it is absolutely brutal. There is no actually supported skyblock version of the pack but some players have figured out the minimal amount of changes needed to make it work. Ask around or search on the official discord channel for all the details. But don't expect any fun down this road.%n%n- Speedrunning. A few players have designed some basic rules and have started to record speedruns to early game goals like the Coke Oven. Ask around or search on the official discord channel for all the details. Maybe you just want to watch how they do it.

# Quest: Oak Trees Are Not Apple Trees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABuA.name=§1§lOak Trees Are Not Apple Trees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABuA.desc=Oak trees that give apples? Who the hell added this to minecraft? %nYou found a way of combining an oak sapling and an apple to get an apple tree sapling. Try to plant one to get a permanent source of food.%n%nOnce you complete this quest, check out the rest of the Quest Tabs. A new one, "Coins, Coins, Coins", has unlocked. You'll want to look through all the quest tabs to make sure something new hasn't unlocked somewhere else occasionally. There are lots of tabs, so be sure to scroll down!

# Quest: "Baked" Potatoes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABug.name=§1§l"Baked" Potatoes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABug.desc=Eating raw potatoes isn't that healthy, as you might have noticed. Some potatoes are green and poisonous already. After you get a furnace you can make delicious baked potatoes as another food alternative. Put a baked potato on a stick to make it even more delicious.

# Quest: Soft Mallet Adventure
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABvA.name=§1§lSoft Mallet Adventure
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABvA.desc=You now have some melon slices or pumpkins but what can you do with them? %n%nYou can just eat them or... use a mallet to get some seeds. OK, let's craft one. Perhaps you can use this mallet for some other things too.

# Quest: Collecting Some Berries
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1Q.name=§1§lCollecting Some Berries
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1Q.desc=Are you waiting for the carrots to grow? Go and find some berry bushes and berries. %n%nThe berries are a good source of food, and you can put these bushes around your house to make a wall. It should provide a good protection against all those monsters that want to come into your house and kill you.

# Quest: Berry Medley
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1g.name=§1§lBerry Medley
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1g.desc=Hmmm... what can you do with all those berries? Just eating? You will see that they have a very low saturation level. Let's plant the new berry bushes and mix the berries to make some better food.

# Quest: Food Variants
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1w.name=§2§1§lFood Variants
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1w.desc=Maybe you noticed already that eating the same food too often is very boring and not healthy any more. Some food like tea leaf can be taken to the furnace and processed further. So take a break and drink a cup of tea. Maybe munch some tasty raisins as they are very nice.

# Quest: Can You Hear the Carrots Grow?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB5A.name=§1§lCan You Hear the Carrots Grow?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB5A.desc=Tired of waiting since your carrots grow sooooo slow?%n%nBone meal will help you to grow food in seconds. %n%nChop down some trees to get a bit of bone meal as a reward.

# Quest: Monster Trap
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADYQ.name=§1§lMonster Trap
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADYQ.desc=If you're lucky enough to spawn near a sand- or rainforest biome, you can find some quicksand. %n%nCollect a stack of it, dig a small ditch, and fill it with the quicksand to protect your "dirt base" home. Just don't fall in!

# Quest: Bamboo Fence
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADsg.name=§1§lBamboo Fence
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADsg.desc=Maybe you're lucky and started in a bamboo forest. Bamboo is a very useful tree since it grows really fast and when you break the bottom-most block, the whole thing comes apart. %n%nYou can use them as sticks, or you can place the bamboo sticks to grow and make a three-block-tall wall to protect your base. You can also use Berry Bushes for that, assuming you don't want to spend materials on fences.

# Quest: Crafting Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEtA.name=§1§lCrafting Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEtA.desc=It's time to get yourself a 3x3 crafting area. Use your flint and some wood to build one!

# Quest: Cows Are Supposed to Moo!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFww.name=§1§lCows Are Supposed to Moo!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFww.desc=What the...? You noticed that sometimes when you kill something, even a cow or chicken, it explodes! What madness! %n%nTo stop it, use a proper GregTech Knife or Butchery Knife to kill them. Craft a flint GregTech knife with a stick and a piece of flint. %n%nTo see its recipe, see how a generic knife is made - NEI should show you many pages. The recipe you need should be on the last page. You can scroll pages with your mouse wheel.%n%nAs a reward, here's an iron knife to use once the flint one wears out.

# Quest: Creeping Dread
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMg.name=§1§lCreeping Dread
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMg.desc=Creepers can make you have a baaaad time. %n%nDrowning Creeper - when it explodes, it surrounds you in a ball of cobble filled with water. Not only do you have to escape, but the cobble is infested with silverfish! And those silverfish are all infernal!  The best way to deal with it is to first escape up or down.  If you have to clear the cobble ball, first clear the water. Surrounding the cobble with a dirt moat will keep the silverfish inside and unable to hide. Put down punjis, quicksand, or lava, and/or spectral glass. Make a wall with a 1x1 window and use that to break the cobbles - fishing silverfish is especially dangerous.%n%nEnder Creeper - Randomly teleports you a short distance - possibly deep underground. 

# Quest: Caught in the Web
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMw.name=§1§lCaught in the Web
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMw.desc=Some spider have nasty modifiers:%n%nWitch spiders reflect missile damage back at you. If you see a red X on their back, draw your melee weapon and prepare for close combat..%n%nMother spiders will spawn a lot of baby spiders on death, some of which may be infernal.%n%nA flying spider can grab the oblivious flier.%n%nGhost spiders are partially invisible and can pass through thin walls.

# Quest: Porkchops With Attitude
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHNA.name=§1§lPorkchops With Attitude
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHNA.desc=The only zombie pigman to watch out for is the Vampire Pigman. He hardly takes any damage unless you use a wooden sword as a stake, or have a magical sword.

# Quest: Flaming Idiots
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHNQ.name=§1§lFlaming Idiots
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHNQ.desc=Blazes are all infernals, and all nasty. Avoid like a plague. Get awesome weapons, awesome armor, and prepare for a fight. %n%nThe alternative is to figure out a way to destroy them with technology.%n%nThe alternative to the alternative is to figure out a different way to get blazepowder and blaze rods.

# Quest: Tell Me When We Reach 20
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHOQ.name=§1§lTell Me When We Reach 20
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHOQ.desc=Jumping all the time is exhausting and makes you really hungry. %nTo reduce your food depletion, you might want to use stairs instead.

# Quest: Staying Cool in the Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHQA.name=§1§lStaying Cool in the Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHQA.desc=If you happen to be near a snowy biome, you can harvest the snow to make delicious smoothies. They are more satiating than eating the berries by themselves.

# Quest: Loading the Chunks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALOg.name=§1§lLoading the Chunks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALOg.desc=Minecraft works in chunks - the 16x16 columns of blocks from bedrock to sky. The chunks in a radius around you are simulated or, in other words, chunkloaded. If a chunk is not loaded, nothing happens in it - crops don't grow, machines don't work. Thus, you want to have your base chunkloaded when you're off exploring. Later on, you want your base chunkloaded so things don't spontaneously blow up, especially multi-block machines.%n%nYou can chunkload in a few ways:%n%n1) Install the ServerUtilities mod (which is an updated FTB Utilites, see §9§n[url]https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/ServerUtilities/releases[/url]§r) and claim chunks, then set them to chunkload. With default settings, you may not be able to claim/chunkload enough per player, so feel free to increase the number. You need to be in singleplayer (SP) or running your own server to do this.%n%n2) Use four types of Anchors from Railcraft, although they are not craftable until the Low Voltage (LV) tier. In SP, or a server you run, cheat in Admin Anchors to chunkload forever, for free. They're limited on servers to prevent TPS dropping from people chunkloading a base forever when they aren't even there. On the officials, you need to use Ender Fragments, Ender Pearls, or Coins to fuel them. Look at the tooltip on each for how long it will work, and in what chunkloader.%n%n3) Use a Chunkloader from GT++. You'll need EU for it.%n%n4) Use one of the blocks that chunkloads itself. If you do this on a server, expect the admins to possibly get very mad at you if it's not something you're allowed to do. Same for vanilla methods.%n%nDon't use chicken chunks to get anchor-like blocks. It's buggy.


## Quest Line: Tips and Tricks
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALA.name=Tips and Tricks
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALA.desc=All our collected wisdom, in one convenient place. Many Greggers died to bring you this knowledge.

# Quest: Automating Power On/Off
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGdg.name=§6§lAutomating Power On/Off
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGdg.desc=Once you have a GT boiler or Large Combustion Engine with a long startup time, you may wish to automate turning it on/off to save fuel, since extra power or Steam will just be voided. Additionally, the bigger your Steam/EU buffer is, the less time your generators will spend heating up, which makes them more efficient. %n%nUse a Machine Controller Cover on the controller for that. You can put it on top, bottom, or sides next to a casing - casings will transmit the redstone signal. You can use a Soldering Iron and Fine Soldering Alloy Wire to set the Redstone Output of a controller block to strong. When set to Strong it can go through a casing, but not hatches, buses, or other blocks. Use it with an activity detector if you want to receive a signal from the controller rather than turning it on/off with one.§r%n%nWith a Machine Controller Cover, you can use redstone to turn the machine on and off. This is handy if you don't want to use a Soft Hammer to disable a machine yourself constantly.%n %nThe best way to do that is with an RS latch. One input will turn the machine on, and one input will turn the machine off. Use a comparator attached to a valve to measure the steam level in your multiblock Iron or Steel Tank. Invert the signal to turn on your boiler when the steam level is low. When the steam level signal is high, turn your boiler off. Use a trail of redstone to lower the signal strength. Because of boiler/turbine warmup, try to set the ON strength to 30 percent of capacity and OFF strength to about 90 percent.%n%nRed alloy wire will hold a redstone signal for a longer distance than normal redstone, while redstone conduits will go indefinitely. You can also use amplified redcrystal to improve the strength of the signal for a long distance, repeating as necessary. %n%nYou can use a Energy Detector Cover in Normal Electrical Storage (including batteries) mode to monitor the power in a battery buffer and use it to enable/disable generators in a similar way. Change mode using a screwdriver. If you use a dense redcrystal, it will only allow signal through at a certain level, perfect for automating this kind of thing.%n%nYou can use MCCs on more than just generators though, you can use it on any multiblock and most singleblocks. This is useful to prevent voiding of materials. Unlike GT++ multies that will halt if full, a non-GT++ multi will void the items or liquids and keep on working, potentially voiding huge amounts of materials. You'll want to use them in combination with Fluid or Item Detection Covers on the output hatch or bus.%n%nFor a video version, check out this video: §9§n[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPfnifJEO64§r[/url]§r

# Quest: Underground Fluids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ-w.name=Underground Fluids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ-w.desc=So you're probably wondering what all the underground fluids are. You can actually check so in NEI now!%n%nJust look for the tab called §oUnderground Fluid Stats§r. You can click §oSee All§r for a general overview, search by fluid, or search by planet.

# Quest: Covering Up
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDw.name=Covering Up
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDw.desc=This quest goes over all of the covers, just in case you forgot or they weren't mentioned. If they have their own quest, look at it for more info. You can put them on basically any GT block, pipe, machine, tank, etc. Though that doesn't consider whether it will work right or be useful. Shift-Right-Click will open a GUI for many of them. For covers that you can adjust the amount of, clicking the left side with a screwdriver goes down, and right goes up. All covers block rain on the side they're attached to. Generally you can adjust covers with a screwdriver, whether they have a GUI or not. You can remove them with a crowbar if you forgot.%n%n§lFluid-Related Covers:§r%nPump: Transfers fluids at the speed specified on the tooltip.%n%nFluid Regulator: Regulates the rate that fluid can go through it, as well as pumping it. Can work x/s or x/t.%n%nSteam Valve: Moves more, but is only for steam. Only goes to IV. Does not work on SH steam.%n%nOverflow: Voids anything over the specified amount in the tank.%n%nFluid Detector: Will emit a redstone signal (RS) based on fluid fill rate of the tank it's on. By default, empty=15, full=0. Use inverted mode to swap. Useful on tanks and hatches.%n%nEnder Fluid Link: Cover version of ender tanks to TP fluid around. Doesn't connect to ender tanks though.%n%nDrain Module: Protects from rain on that side, and will fill the tank with water from rain if it can. Useless.%n%nFluid Filter: Filters fluid going through it. Click with a cell to set it.%n%nShutter: Blocks items/fluids when active. Use it with a machine controller and RS. Does not visually disconnect/block. You place it between the pipes, and put the MC on the same pipe.%n%n§lItem-Related Covers:§r%nConveyor: Sends items. Use an item pipe in import mode or on a GT block/machine.%n%nRobot Arm: Sends from a specific slot in the machine it's on (internal) to another specific slot in a block next to it (adjacent). Keep going through numbers until you get it right, it seems to change per machine. If the output slot is full, it won't output. There need to be a valid block with slots to send to or the settings won't save.%n%nItem Detector: Will emit RS based on item fill rate of the block it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Detects by filled slots, so doesn't work right with the super/quantum chests. Probably better for busses.%n%nItem Filter: This one is work-in-progress that is not yet finished. Feel free to contribute.%n%n§lEU-Related Covers:§r%nEnergy Detector: Will emit RS based on EU fill rate of the batbuff/tank it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Make sure to set it to include batteries. Can also detect steam for some reason.%n%nPower Pass Upgrade: Read the tooltip, then ask Bart how it works, he didn't bother telling anyone. He'll probably just tell you the code is the best documentation, just like the Tectech guys. May not actually be finished/work, either.%n%nTesla Coil/Tesla Coil Rich Edition: Use with the tesla tower to send EU wirelessly or something. %n%n§lOther Covers:§r%nPlayer Detector: Detects players. About 10 block range. §4Currently owner/other is inverted on non-pipes due to some bug or another.§r%n%nActivity Detector: Detects either recipe progress or idleness. 0%%=0 RS, ~95%%=14 by default. In idle mode, idleness is 15, and is 0 when running by default.%n%nMachine Controller: Turns machine on/off based on RS. Disable machine will keep it off regardless of RS state. Safe Mode only works on MBs. If a MB runs out of power, it will normally turn off, but a MC will turn it back on, continuing to void stuff. This will set it to the disable machine state instead. You will also get a notification. §4Safe mode is currently broken?§r%n%nNeeds Maintenance: Emits RS if it meets the condition specified. Rotor=turbine?%n%nRedstone Transmitter/Receiver (In/Out): OK, these things are confusing, so listen closely. First, set a frequency, either by using the GUI, or using the original way: right clicking it with an item. Empty hand = 0, other items = their item ID. Be careful not to reset it to 0 by accident. Honestly, just use the GUI. You can set it to private or not, it's the same kind of thing as EnderStorage, so you don't blare RS across the server. Channel state = RS level.%n%nRT(O) sets the channel state based on the redstone level sent from outside to the specific side. You can TP a RS from this to the RR(O).%nRT(I) sets the channel state based on redstone level that would be emitted from the machine itself. §4Always sends 15, so it's useless.§r%nRR(O) outputs redstone level based on channel state. You can TP RS from the RT(O) to here.%nRR(I) controls whether a machine can work based on channel state, just like a machine controller cover does. If it has 0 RS, it stays off. At least 1, and it turns on. You send the signal from elsewhere with the RT(O).%nRR(I) can also be used in conjunction with other covers whose states talk about conditional.%n%nIC2 Heat vents: Speeds up machines a tiny amount? Also looks neat. TODO: someone please look at the code to see what it actually does.%n%nCrafting Table: Adds a crafting table to the block you can use. Mostly cosmetic.%n%nPlanks/Plates/Foils: Blocks I/O on that side. Use a screwdriver to set allowed types of stuff through. Blocks everything by default. Set the output to another side first to avoid changing its settings too. You'll probably 'use' this by accident at least once.%n%nComputer Monitor: Adds a visual look. Cosmetic-only cover.%n%nLens: Cosmetic-only cover.%n%nYou can also use AE2 facades as cosmetic covers.


## Quest Line: Tier 0 - Stone Age

# Quest: Ready, Set, Go!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADw.name=§2§lReady, Set, Go!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADw.desc=You probably should have a home by now. A steady supply of food is a fundamental requirement at all times. Take this journal to keep track of the things you've eaten. You will have to travel far in this tier, better be prepared!

# Quest: Sand: The Gathering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQ.name=§2§lSand: The Gathering

# Quest: Basic Processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEg.name=§2§lBasic Processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEg.desc=Most things are unavailable at the moment, so let's begin with something simple. Take some of your cobblestone and smelt it into regular stone. Since this modpack is evil, you'll need to use wood for that. How much fun is that?!

# Quest: Macerator v0.1 Alpha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEw.name=§1§2§lMacerator v0.1 Alpha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEw.desc=This fancy little device works (almost...) like a macerator. Some people say it's even better, since it does not require power, yay! You only need to craft one for this quest, but you probably should make some more if you can...

# Quest: Gravel: The Gathering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFA.name=§2§lGravel: The Gathering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFA.desc=Your tools will eventually lose durability. You think it would be a good idea to collect more gravel in order to provide yourself with flint for more tools. Try searching near water.

# Quest: Clay: The Gathering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFQ.name=§2§lClay: The Gathering

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFg.name=§2§lFinite Water!?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFg.desc=Finite water is a problem, that's for sure. Last night, you had an idea. If you can drink cacti, you should also be able make water out of 8 cacti and use that for most recipes that require water. How cool is that? So what about another trade? 10 wood for... 3 cacti so you can setup a farm. Deal?%n%nTo automate the farm, place a string next to the cactus and a sand on top of the string. Now when the cactus grows, it will automatically break!  You can stack this horizontally and vertically to make a very efficient cactus farm.  Use water to redirect the cactus to a convenient pickup location or to above a hopper.%n%nFirst player to make a base running off of only cactus water gets a cape!

# Quest: Important Tools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJA.name=§2§lImportant Tools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJA.desc=In order to craft even basic machines, you'll need new tools. Most of them can be replaced by machines later. For now, you should become familiar with each of their recipes, as you will need a lot of these tools, starting today.%n%nYour new tools can also be used to make Railcraft water tanks, a very useful multiblock considering the finite water feature.%n%nThere are also electric versions of the tools, you can upgrade later if you want. Also, there are many versions of the tools, they generally follow the same rules as tinkers parts in terms of how good they are, similarly to turbines. You can look at the spreadsheet for more info on GT tool stats.%n%nFor this quest, you can use whatever materials you want. The gem version of the saw is crafted differently to metal versions. Higher tier tools need steel or tungstensteel rods instead of sticks.

# Quest: Getting Iron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJQ.name=§2§lGetting Iron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJQ.desc=Iron can be found in multiple veins. %nMagnetite veins (Y 30-180), Chalcopyrite veins (Y 5-60), and Limonite veins (Y 10-40) all contain iron ore.

Certain tool upgrades can give that directly if you have an upgrade slot available.

# Quest: Better Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJw.name=§2§lBetter Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJw.desc=While standard chests are good for your basic items and goods, they are not ideal for storing a large amount of ore. You should build yourself some barrels in order to keep things organized.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKA.name=§2§lYou Shall Proceed
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKA.desc=As you've gathered and crafted all materials and tools you need for your basic steam machinery, you may now proceed to the next tier. Keep in mind that you'll need mountains of resources in order to craft even the simplest things, so you probably should stock up on all ores in this tier. But that's up to you.%n%nAs a special reward, you get a pair of Holo Glasses to look inside your inventories. Place it into the mask slot, and use the keybind to turn it on. Sometimes it gets turned off somehow, so try pressing the button if that happens.

# Quest: Your First Tool
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB2A.name=§2§lYour First Tool
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB2A.desc=When your tinkers tables are ready, you can craft your first §oreal§r tool. If you didn't find a village yet to grab some parts from the chest, you can only craft flint tools.%n%nLet's start with a pickaxe, an axe, and a shovel. At this point swords are unobtainable since they need metals like iron or bronze which you will get at a later stage. In the meantime use your gregtech swords.%n%nKeep in mind that most of the original tool parts from Tinker's Construct are not shown in NEI. That doesn't mean that you can't craft them - use the tooltips on patterns and molds as guidance. %n%nYour new tools are weak at first, but the more you use them the better they will get. You get a modifier slot after some levels, needing more as you level it up. They will level up to level 99 if you play long enough, with 20 modifier slots. Tool parts can be replaced for a bit of level XP, however the tool must be fully repaired first.%n%nYou need to level up the mining level each time you replace the parts to unleash the full power of the pickaxe. Stone->Copper for this pickaxe. If you manage to get a Zombie, Skeleton, or Creeper head, you can use it to skip the level-up process. This doesn't use up a modifier level, but does change the look until you change the pickaxe part out.%n%nItem=Usable when mining level is X or less%nZombie=1%nSkeleton=2%nCreeper=4%nWither Skeleton=7%nNether Star=8%n%nYou can use paper binding to add an extra modifier, but it's very important because you will get modifiers with tool levels.

# Quest: Upgrade 2.0
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB2g.name=§2§k§l§l§r§2§lUpgrade 2.0

How can you mine these with just a flint pickaxe?%n%nI have an idea; bring me some of the stone you mined with your flint pickaxe and I will give you a better tool head in exchange.%n%nRemember to level it up again either with monster heads or by mining.

# Quest: Malachite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4A.name=§2§lMalachite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4A.desc=Another copper source is "malachite" which can be found between Y 10-40. This vein contains more iron ore variants like "brown limonite", "yellow limonite" and "banded iron ore".%n%nTo see where an ore can be found, click the raw ore in NEI, and it will show you more details. Works with small ores too.

# Quest: Creosote
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4Q.name=§l§2§lCreosote
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4Q.desc=I guess you already turned some wood into charcoal and wonder what to do with all this creosote?%n%nWell, you can burn it in a normal furnace to cook your food, or you can make some torches with it.%n%nLater in LV, you can use it to heat up Railcraft (RC) boilers. %nOr you can run combustion generators with it, but that's super inefficient.

# Quest: Animal Farms
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4g.name=§2§lAnimal Farms
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4g.desc=Trying to get some leather or wool? You'd probably need to spend a lot of time hunting animals and traveling around, or you could simply make a farm to get a decent amount of leather, wool, and meat close to home. Make sure you don't put too many animals in the pen or they will overcrowd and kill each other. This happens to villagers as well.%n%nAnimals will prioritize moving towards grass blocks over any other blocks, and if there's no grass blocks around, they prefer lit blocks over dark blocks. You can encourage animals to stay in pens, or at least not crowd the edges, by removing grass from around both sides of the fence and under it, and by placing a torch in the center of the pen. For sheep that need the grass to eat, which reduces time to mature and replaces sheared wool instantly, place it in the center of a cleared out area with a border of non-grass.%n%nAlso, large quantities can cause server lag, especially if they are bumping into each other a lot. So if you are in multiplayer, make sure you limit animals to no more than roughly one per block for small entities like chickens and one per two blocks for large entities like cows.%n%nAs an alternative, most animal and mob drops can be obtained from less laggy IC2 crop farms.

# Quest: Gardener
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4w.name=§2§lGardener
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4w.desc=If you were wondering: Why do I never get seeds when destroying grass? Because. %n%nUse your new mattock on the grass blocks that do not have water anywhere nearby to find some seeds.

# Quest: XP Usage?!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8g.name=§2§lXP Usage?!

Though you can also just make them yourself in EV. Plus the chest is nice, and can be placed underneath blocks and still opened.%n%nIf all surface meteors have been raided, put some skystone in your Ore Finder to find underground ones, or wait until you can make a Meteorite Compass to find them.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF4A.desc=The Ore Finder Wand reduces the tedium of locating needed veins. If you're not sure how to craft Magnetic Iron Rod for it, check its Shapeless Crafting tab in NEI.%n%nOnce you put an ore sample into the wand, it will tell you if this ore is nearby. When you get close to the target, you will hear the sound, and the wand will tilt down to the point of being upside-down if there's a lot of target ore nearby.%n%nUse NEI to figure out which ore is the best for your search. If you don't have the needed ore, some basic ones can be purchased in the Coins tab. %n%nOpen the wand's inventory with Shift+RMB when looking at the ground. Put the sample ore into the slot. %nThe rod has a 60-block range both up and down, so it can miss a vein that is located very low or if you are above the sea level.%n%nThe rod appears to work based on the GT's Material system, so anything of the same material will work. %nThat includes crushed ores, dusts, ingots, gems, rods, you name it. For things that don't belong to a particular Material, the rod appears to search only for that exact block - for instance, you won't detect a small ores with the usual ore block.%n%nIf the detected ore is a part of a vein, you will see a discovery message in the chat, and the vein will be automatically logged into the visual prospecting tab of your journey map.%n%nThe wand also works from inventory and hotbar, so you don't need to be actively holding it, but you get style points if you do.%n%nThe ore in the wand is stored with the player, not the wand.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHSA.name=§2§lNo Self-Healing Tools Here...Yet
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHSA.desc=New players might be surprised by finding the Tinker's Construct Ball of Moss in NEI not showing an actual recipe.%n%nIn this pack you have to first gain expertise in Thaumcraft to craft it. Go and become a dangerous wizard, and you'll gain the power needed to craft the Ball of Moss and make your tools heal themselves. Of course, you need to get to the Twilight Forest and get some aluminium ingots before you can begin. The Ball of Moss is in the GTNH tab of the Thaumonomicon, and requires infusion. There are many other great things in the Thaumonomicon, but be wary of warp.%n%nHave a beer to prepare for your long journey.

# Quest: Options For Finding Aluminium in This Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHSg.name=§2§lOptions For Finding Aluminium in This Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHSg.desc=It can be hard to find Aluminum Gravel Ore on old servers or unlucky world seeds.%n%nThe alternatives are:%n- Planting the Aluminum Ore Berries from the Smeltery quest,%n- Searching for aluminium bars in chests,%n- A recipe with XP buckets on a crafting table.%n%nOnce you reach LV, you can get aluminium from processing various ores or smelting Sapphire in an Electric Blast Furnace (EBF).%nAt MV, you can electrolyze clay dust or red granite dust. Check NEI for more options.%n%n

# Quest: How to Open Your Wooden Doors?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJHQ.name=§2§lHow to Open Your Wooden Doors?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJHQ.desc=Wooden doors make your House safer. Let's craft some wooden Pressure plates and Buttons to open these Doors.%n%nDoors will open when they receive a redstone signal, and close again after it stops. If you place the plates on either side of a door, it will open when you step on it. Or a monster does. Double doors will open together.%n%nYou'll need to use Oak for this quest. Purchase some saplings from the Coins tab if you don't have any nearby.%n%nPressure plates will send a RS when an entity is on top of them. There are different types, like items or not, or mobs/player/any entity/etc.%n%nButtons will emit one for about 2 seconds before resetting.%n%nLevers will emit a signal until switched back off. 

# Quest: Got a Flat Tire?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJYg.name=§2§lGot a Flat Tire?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJYg.desc=The crowbar is the GT tool used to remove a cover off of a machine, pipe, or wire. Covers can be decorative, functional like pumps and conveyors, or for safety, like putting a wooden plank over your steam pipes so they don't burn you.%n%nSorry, it only comes in blue!%n%nYes, we know there are also red crowbars, but they are from Railcraft and generally inferior. Better ignore them.

# Quest: Too Many Leaves
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKoA.name=§2§lToo Many Leaves
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKoA.desc=Want to clear out shrubbery but don't want to pull out leaves by hand? Need to find that last log hidden in the middle of a bunch of leaves?%n%nTry an Iron Scythe! When used, it clears out a 5x5x5 area of leaves, crops, flowers, or grass. Excellent for tearing through Sacred Oak leaves or dense shrubbery in certain biomes. Later when you have a Cutting Machine you can upgrade to a Diamond Scythe with a 7x7x7 area of effect, or use Amethyst for 9x9x9 to FLEX.%n%nThe lower tiers break leaves instantly but don't seem to have the 3x3x3 range for some reason.

# Quest: Personally, I Prefer Pepsi™
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKoQ.name=§2§lPersonally, I Prefer Pepsi™
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKoQ.desc=You may have noticed that you can make more than just Charcoal in a Coke Oven, you can also make Coke.%n%nThe data below shows the burn time (BT), how long it takes in ticks - 20 ticks is 1 second - and how much creosote (Cr) you gain.%n%nCoal 1600BT + 1800t -> Coal Coke 3200BT + 500l Cr%nWood Log 300BT + 1800t -> Charcoal 1600BT + 250l Cr%nCactus 50BT + 500t -> Cactus Charcoal 400BT + 30l Cr%nCactus Charcoal 400BT + 500t -> Cactus Coke 800BT + 30l Cr%nSugar Cane 50BT + 500t -> Sugar Charcoal 400BT + 30l Cr%nSugar Charcoal 400BT + 500t   -> Sugar Coke 800BT +30l Cr%n%nYou want to save Coke for making steel in your Bricked Blast Furnace (BBF) later on.

# Quest: More Food, More Hearts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKsQ.name=§2§lMore Food, More Hearts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKsQ.desc=So, food is great, right? But what's even greater is eating tons of it! Too boring and pointless you say? Well, what if I told you you can get extra hearts just by expanding your palate. You get 1 point for every half shank of hunger from a food eaten, and after 50 points, you get 1 extra heart! Now you have a reason to make all those Pam's foods. Each food contributes its shank-value once. Eating something from a lunch box counts as if you took it out and ate it manually.%n%nIf you want to see what foods you've eaten, you can use the Food Journal, but it's clunky. Realistically, you want to use NEI to both see foods eaten and not eaten. You can search for 'not yet eaten' to see foods left, and 'assisted' to see foods eaten. You need to have started diminishing returns first to see this.%n%nIf it doesn't work, go to NEI options at bottom-left when the inventory is open, then click on Inventory, and change Search Mode to Regex. Then restart your client and try searching again.§r%n%nThere are also two commands:%n%n/foodlist size%nTells you the overall progress, and the progress to the next heart.%n%n/foodlist sync <PlayerName>%nSync your food progression with the server if it gets out of sync.

# Quest: Loot Games
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALPA.name=§2§lLoot Games
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALPA.desc=It looks like you've found a secret room hidden...not so deep within the earth. Pretty close to the surface, actually. You can find these all over the place, and have a chance at sweet sweet loot if you're good at simon says. It counts the highest level you completed, so you can fail the other rounds on purpose to go faster if you don't think you can do better. BTW, cheaters go to minecraft hell, where all the blocks have hardness -1.%n%nIf you fail with Minesweeper, it blows up. Be sure to make room for escape!%n%nMake sure that no water or oil is flowing into the room because of worldgen, or it will kill you and destroy your grave because of 'cheating'. This is a bug.

# Quest: The power of prospecting!
betterquesting.quest.bMKIeFhNQluRks9YzpqEGQ.name=§6§lThe power of prospecting!
betterquesting.quest.bMKIeFhNQluRks9YzpqEGQ.desc=At the top of your map screen (J by default) there are multiple tabs, some of them will be very useful and will save you a ton of searching!%n%nGT Oreveins - this tab will keep track of the veins for you, to save a vein to map right-click a naturally generated ore (some tools can't right click)%nGT Underground fluids - this will help you later (MV)%nTC Nodes - this tab will keep track of thaumcraft nodes for you (you need to scan them first)%n%n§3Small Ores are not part of veins and thus do not uncover a vein on the map. However veins generate extra small ores related to the vein in their chunks, so they can still be useful in your search (though not all small ores are related to a nearby vein so don't be fooled).%n%nAnother great interaction is that you can use the NEI search bar in highlight mode (doubleclick it) and then go to the map screen to get the matching uncovered ore veins highlighted!


## Quest Line: Tier 0.5 - Steam
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg.name=Tier 0.5 - Steam
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg.desc=Steam to electricity (EU) is the progression of this tab. Most of the machines you make in this tier you'll use the whole game, if in an upgraded form.

# Quest: Better Tank... Iron Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEA.name=§4§3§lBetter Tank... Iron Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEA.desc=Storing more than 16 buckets of fluid in one tank? Sure! Just make an iron tank or upgrade the Buildcraft tank.%n%nDiamond tanks carry up to 64 buckets and obsidian ones are blast proof. There's even more past that, but you should probably use GT tanks or large cells instead.

# Quest: Welcome to Tier 0.5, Steam!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALA.name=§3§lWelcome to Tier 0.5, Steam!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALA.desc=Welcome, and well done so far! This tier is all about your first machines, getting more stuff from your ores and making bronze ingots in a more efficient manner.%n%nFor water, check out the Water Siding Tank multiblock in the Multiblock goals tab.%n%nTo connect up your boilers, be sure to provide water from the bottom, they'll accept only water from this side, so no risk of melting your pipe. Wooden pipes are fine for this. Make sure you never run out of water - §4adding water to a dry hot boiler will cause it to explode!§r%n%nSteam will come out from the sides. Remember, steam is hot! It will destroy wooden pipes. And it can burn you if you walk on bronze pipes full of steam.  Cover them with wooden planks or paper. Or just don't walk on/next to them.%n%nAnd no, you can't automate it. Make an electric one if you want to do that.

# Quest: More Advanced Alloys
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALg.name=§3§lMore Advanced Alloys
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALg.desc=Your smeltery does a great job mixing metals into alloys, but it's not very efficient, and limited in its complexity. You need something new, so why not put your steam to some use? The Alloy Smelter can make bronze for you directly, using ingots, dusts, or even nuggets. You can make a nugget mold as well to turn ingots into nuggets if you have steel.%n%nIt might also come in handy when processing raw rubber. You should keep an eye on recipes to see when machines offer better options to make items...%n%n§3NOTE: Like all steam machines, the output port is a steam outlet when recipes complete. It must not be blocked. Also, steam is hot, remember? Change the output side by whacking the machine with a wrench. The 3x3 grid will show you which side the output will move to when you whack it.§r%n%nYou can empty the machine by putting a hopper beneath it.%n%n§4WARNING: The Alloy Smelter recipes take a §llot§r§4 of steam.§r Do them one by one until you understand how fast you use steam, and how much you will need buffered. Large pipes are a decent "poor man's" buffer, and the boiler can hold quite a bit of steam, as well as the machine itself. Once you get a little further along, make a larger steam buffer with an iron or steel railcraft tank.

# Quest: Upgrade: High Speed Alloys
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALw.name=§3§lUpgrade: High Speed Alloys
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALw.desc=Like most machines, there is a more advanced version of the alloy smelter. It uses the same total amount of steam as its predecessor but does the job twice as fast.%n%nKeep in mind that it uses quite a lot of steam, so you better have enough of it in boilers, pipes, or tanks.

# Quest: A Very Important Alloy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMA.name=§3§lA Very Important Alloy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMA.desc=The most important alloy (until you reach a higher tier) is undoubtedly red alloy. Fortunately, you have an alloy smelter, so grab some redstone and combine it with copper to get yourself a handful of that. %n%nDon't confuse your bronze with your copper or else you'll be scratching your head.

# Quest: The Hell is That?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQ.name=§3§lThe Hell is That?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQ.desc=In order to get more machines, you'll need pistons. But not those amateurish ones, you need special ones, and I shall guide you in the making of them.%n%n§3PS: Infernals can drop them, though you won't get credit for the quest that way.

# Quest: Macerator v1.0!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMg.name=§3§lMacerator v1.0!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMg.desc=Finally you are able to make a device that will replace your mortar. However, the "no-durability" feature of this device comes with a cost: You need 2 diamonds for the grinding heads.%n%nThe macerator will double your ore output. Put ores through it instead of smelting directly.%n%n§3NOTE: Remember, don't block the output port and don't stand behind it.§r

# Quest: Extracting Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMw.name=§3§lExtracting Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMw.desc=As you'll need rubber later to make cables from wires, you should get yourself a steam extractor. You can also use this machine to get more dyes from flowers, or process different fruits into juice.

# Quest: A Clear View
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANA.name=§3§4§3§lA Clear View
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANA.desc=Are you still living in your dirt/cobble hut? How about letting in some sunlight? Grind up some sand and flint and craft some glass dust. Put it in your smeltery and pour it into a casting basin to make clear glass.%n%n§4Hint: In order to use it for recipes, you have to chisel it.%n%n§3PS: The macerator no longer gives tiny piles, just uncraft a normal pile to get tiny ones. You'll appreciate this once you have a mixer in LV.

# Quest: Hammer time v2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANQ.name=§3§lHammer time v2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANQ.desc=Using 6 ingots to craft a hammer seems pretty wasteful, as this tool has durability. How nice would it be to have a machine that does the same but without having durability and using three ingots to make two plates? Guess what, there is one! And you should totally get one.

# Quest: Compressing Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANg.name=§4§3§lCompressing Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANg.desc=This rather simple device does a very important job: compression. It's main function is to press 9 ingots into a block, but it's also useful for a variety of recipes, for example making firm tofu.

# Quest: Upgrade: A Better Compressor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANw.name=§4§3§lUpgrade: A Better Compressor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANw.desc=An updated version of the steam compressor. Uses the same total amount of steam as its predecessor but does the job twice as fast.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOA.desc=An updated version of the steam forge hammer. Uses the same total amount of steam as its predecessor but does the job twice as fast.

# Quest: Upgrade: Extractor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOQ.name=§3§lUpgrade: Extractor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOQ.desc=An updated version of the steam extractor. Uses the same total amount of steam as its predecessor but does the job twice as fast.%n%nYou probably want to craft this, as the extractor does also extract your nerves...

# Quest: Upgrade: Better Macerator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOg.name=§3§lUpgrade: Better Macerator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOg.desc=An updated version of the steam macerator. Uses the same total amount of steam as its predecessor but does the job twice as fast.

# Quest: Steam Alternatives
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOw.name=§3§lSteam Alternatives
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOw.desc=There is more than one way to get steam for your machines. This completely optional questline shows you some alternative methods for producing steam.%n%n§3For the ones that need glass, you'll need to progress a few more quests to see how to do so, though you can also make it now if you know how to use NEI to find the recipe.

# Quest: Upgrade: Coal Boiler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPA.name=§3§lUpgrade: Coal Boiler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPA.desc=This is basically just an upgrade to your current coal boiler, however it produces more than twice as much steam. Something you should consider building if you're planning to get some of the upgraded machines.

# Quest: Another Use for Java, I Mean Lava
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPQ.name=§3§lAnother Use for Java, I Mean Lava
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPQ.desc=Your Lava boiler has been updated to the latest version. So what's new?%n%nYou can of course use high level inputs by putting a tank above it. This version is compatible only with Water on the sides and Steam at the back. It also allows for manual user input from Water or Lava container objects.%n%nThe latest version now comes with improved Lava memory handling in the form of an internal tank and advanced garbage collection at the bottom for the resulting obsidian blocks!%n%n§3Did you know? Over 3 billion machines run on Lava!

# Quest: The Power of the Sun
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPg.name=§3§lThe Power of the Sun
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPg.desc=The sun has quite a bit of power, so why not use it to produce steam?%n%nFill it with water on the bottom side to produce steam. Unlike the other boilers, this only outputs steam on the output port side.%n%n§3Hint: The solar boiler calcifies and becomes less efficient over time - §4ending up at zero steam production!§3 Later on you can consider using distilled water to avoid calcification.%n%n§3You'll need silver from the Twilight Forest (LV+) or from small ores for this.

# Quest: Using Steam to Cook Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPw.name=§3§lUsing Steam to Cook Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPw.desc=A rather slow process, but it's more efficient than using a regular furnace.

# Quest: Upgrade: Better Furnace
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQA.name=§3§lUpgrade: Better Furnace
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQA.desc=An updated version of the steam furnace. Uses the same total amount of steam as its predecessor but does the job twice as fast.

# Quest: Blastoff!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQ.name=§3§lBlastoff!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQ.desc=It's about time to make some steel. Look in the Multiblock Goals quest tab and build a Bricked Blast Furnace. Return here once you've made at least 8 steel ingots.

# Quest: Time For Some Logic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQg.name=§3§lTime For Some Logic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQg.desc=Good news! You are now able to advance to the next tier! Bad news: You still have to craft a lot of things before you can begin. Fear not mortal, I shall guide you!

# Quest: Wired, Weird?!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQw.name=§4§3§lWired, Weird?!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQw.desc=Two of the very basic materials for machines are wires and cables. For cables you can either use a rubber sheet in the crafting table or use rubber bars in the alloy smelter. Not very efficient, but there will be a better way later.

# Quest: Your First Electronic Circuit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARA.name=§3§lYour First Electronic Circuit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARA.desc=Steam machines are quite stupid, they just do one thing over and over again. As you advance into the electrical age, you've decided that you want the machines to have more features, like automatic output in order to create some automation. For that, you need electronic circuits.

# Quest: Wire-Wrap
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQ.name=§3§lWire-Wrap
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQ.desc=Placing wires without insulation seems to be a bad idea. Now that you have an extractor to extract raw rubber out of sticky resin and an alloy smelter to further process it using sulfur, you should work on getting some insulating rubber bars.

# Quest: Basic Crafting: Motors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARw.name=§3§lBasic Crafting: Motors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARw.desc=Motors are little devices that can turn electrical power into rotational energy. Very useful for all kind of machines, and not that difficult to craft. The pattern is always the same, only the materials change with tiers. For now you can use redstone to magnetize your iron rod. Later on you will build an Electromagnetic Polarizer.

# Quest: Basic Crafting: Rotors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASA.name=§3§lBasic Crafting: Rotors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASA.desc=Rotors are also crafted using an identical pattern with different materials. A bit annoying to craft at the moment, but you don't need a lot of them anyway.

# Quest: Basic Crafting: Machine Hulls
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASQ.name=§3§lBasic Crafting: Machine Hulls
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASQ.desc=All machines need a hull to keep their private parts together. Good news is: They are crafted in the same way for every tier, only the materials change.%n%n§3As noted on the tooltip, you can also use a machine hull to pass EU through, at 1A. This can be useful for a 1A diode on Thermos servers, splitting cables from 4A->1A or in a cleanroom later. You can also pass items or fluids through it.

# Quest: Where Can I Put All the Liquids?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVA.name=§3§lWhere Can I Put All the Liquids?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVA.desc=With your brand new alloy smelter you are able to combine two materials. What happens if you mix some obsidian dust and thickened glass? Obsidian glass, great. Your first tank that you can make would be a Buildcraft tank. This tank can carry up 16 buckets of a single fluid. It's possible to upgrade those tanks so they can hold up to 64 buckets.%nYou can also stack the tanks to increase capacity.

# Quest: A Quite Different Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdw.name=§3§lA Quite Different Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdw.desc=Regular chests can fill up rather quickly if you happen to collect mob drops like swords and/or armor. By using a cabinet, you can store up to 270 items of the same type. Also, it doesn't need a dolly - you can break it normally and it will retain contents. %n%nPerfect for storing IC2 crop seeds, Forestry saplings, or bees!

# Quest: Flint and Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB3g.name=§3§lFlint and Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB3g.desc=After you make steel you are able to craft flint and steel. I guess you'll want to travel to the Nether as soon as possible but be aware; the Nether is a very dangerous place.%n%nNote: The ball of moss gives a tinker's tool self-repair. But if the tool is completely broken, it won't repair it.%n%nNote that the flint and steel can take a few times to work.

# Quest: THE NETHER
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB3w.name=§3§m§l§m§4§3§lTHE NETHER
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB3w.desc=Now more dangerous with extra hardcore infernal mobs. Have fun and take care. Remember that the flint and steel can take a few times to work, but there are other ways to make fire ...%n%nBe sure to bring a tough companion along to keep you alive. If you have no friends, why not make an Iron Golem and push it through first, or bring the materials for more along with you?%n%nAlso, §lwhen§r you die here, not if, your graves will spawn skeletons because of the darkness. Make sure you light up areas where you might die, and when recovering graves light up the area §lfirst§r so that you don't end up dying over and over and making a mess.%n%nWatch out for some mobs! They'll take minimal damage from any weapon that is not their weakness. So if you seem to not be doing much damage, you probably aren't! Think about other options to hurt/kill the monster.

# Quest: Wiremill v0.2 Alpha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB7Q.name=§3§lWiremill v0.2 Alpha

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB7w.name=§3§lOoo, Shiny! (Not Platinum!)
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB7w.desc=To make your first macerator you need two diamonds, and to enter the Twilight Forest you need one. Finding a diamond vein would help you a lot. Go and look for one at Y 5-20.

# Quest: How to Make Rubber
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8A.name=§3§lHow to Make Rubber
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8A.desc=Making rubber is now more complicated - you need raw rubber and sulfur. Finding a sulfur vein in the Nether seems like a good idea, doesn't it? Found on Y 5-20. Later on you can get sulfur from chemicals like hydrogen sulfide or pyrite.%n%n§4Sphalerite will be important later for gallium and zinc. Save it until you can fully process it in LV.

# Quest: Lit Way to Get Charred
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8Q.name=§4§3§lLit Way to Get Charred
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8Q.desc=You have found an alternative way of making charcoal with a "charcoal pile igniter".%n%nGo and start getting massive amounts of charcoal.%n%nIf this is your first multiblock, look at the extended tooltip (hold shift) or visit §9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Charcoal_Pile_Igniter[/url]§r to see how to make it work.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFg.name=§4§3§lPollution What....?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFg.desc=If you are running your bricked blast furnace for a long time you will sometimes get headaches, nausea and other weird effects. Yes this is pollution... from making so much steel. If you can collect some rubber sheets, I will trade you a complete hazmat suit.

# Quest: Rubber Sheets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGA.name=§4§3§lRubber Sheets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGA.desc=Let's make a mold for the rubber sheets. They are mainly used for conveyors and cables.%n%nAt this stage, making cables by hand with rubber sheets is faster and cheaper in power than the Alloy Smelter recipe for the cables.%n%nWith the sheets, you should be able to craft Piston Boots - a massive upgrade to your mobility. Check out the questline Getting Around to find them.

# Quest: How Can I Carry All These Items?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACLg.name=§3§lHow Can I Carry All These Items?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACLg.desc=After you made your first steel, you are able to craft a small backpack. It has 36 slots, which is a bit more than a small chest. Later you can make it even larger. %n%nYou can have at most four of these backpacks in your inventory.%n%nYou can put one on your back and set it to automatically pick up stuff. In you controls, check that the command "Open Backpacks" has a key and doesn't have conflicts. The key only works after the backpack is added to the back slot, which can be done by using Shift+<Open Backpacks Key>.%n§r%nYou can rename your backpack by pressing Shift+RMB when holding it in your hand.

# Quest: Upgrade of the Upgrade of the...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVA.name=§3§k§l§1§2§3§lUpgrade of the Upgrade of the...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVA.desc=It's upgrade time. Unlock redstone and obsidian level for your different tools.%n%nRemember, a fresh tool head starts at one level below.  So you'll need to use it enough to level it up before you can mine at the proper level. Go strip-mine a mountain or something.

# Quest: Moving Your Tanks, Chests, and Barrels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACcQ.name=§3§lMoving Your Tanks, Chests, and Barrels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACcQ.desc=Want to move your chests and barrels without spilling all the things (buildcraft™)? No problem! Make a dolly and you can carry your full chests, barrels or storage drawers anywhere you want. But be warned, you will get a slowness debuff so hopefully you don't have to travel very far. Non-portable buildcraft and iron tanks can be moved without losing fluids too.%n%nShift right click an empty dolly to collapse it. It won't carry anything until you unfold it, but it will stack and can go in your backpack.%n%n§3PS: Later on you can fly or make a traveller's belt to get around the debuff.§r

# Quest: One Anvil... Better Make That Two!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACtg.name=§3§lOne Anvil... Better Make That Two!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACtg.desc=With your brand-new Compressor you are able to make some metal blocks for your new anvil. Better craft two anvils, one will be required for the forge hammer.%n%n§3With the anvil you can repair, rename and enchant armor and tools.§r

# Quest: Accelerated Plant Growth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACwQ.name=§3§lAccelerated Plant Growth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACwQ.desc=As you might've discovered by now, plants grow very slowly. So why don't you try to speed that up a little? A watering can will come in handy.

# Quest: Tool Forge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5Q.name=§5§3§lTool Forge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5Q.desc=After getting alumite, it's time to craft a tool forge for making bigger (and better) Tinkers tools. 

# Quest: One Block Mining is so Old School
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5g.name=§3§lOne Block Mining is so Old School
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5g.desc=By making a hammer you are now able to mine a shaft of 3x3 blocks. You can use iron, steel, or alumite poured from the Smeltery, it doesn't need to be steel. Higher tier metals require the MV extruder.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5w.name=§3§lCutting a Tree log by log is so Old School
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5w.desc=By making a lumber axe, you are now able to cut down an entire tree in one hit. Don't forget your backpack when you're cutting a sacred oak down.%n%nProtip: With wooden equivalents of casts, make an lumber axe completely out of netherrack - lower mining speed means less XP needed to level it up. Use the modifier slots to add Reinforced. Once you've leveled it up enough, upgrade the parts for better ones, such as steel, alumite, or others. The higher-level metals will require an MV Extruder. Keep in mind that the auto-smelt modifier doesn't work, so don't bother with it.%n%nThe quest will accept a lumber axe from any material.

# Quest: Better Than Iron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADtA.name=§3§lBetter Than Iron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADtA.desc=But not as good as steel. Mostly, this is used in machine hulls, or in tools if you don't want to use steel up for that.%n%nTo make wrought iron, you need a tinkers smelter to melt some iron ingots down and cast nuggets; or use an ingot and a saw to get your nuggets. Now put these in a furnace to get wrought iron nuggets. With the compressor, you can compress the nuggets into ingots.%n%n§3Hint: Crushed or purified iron ore (not a mixed version like pyrite, look for Iron Ore in Chalcopyrite veins) can be smelted to iron nuggets directly. Or you can use an alloy smelter to turn iron ingots into nuggets faster than a smeltery. You can also use a saw to cut up iron ingots into nuggets.%n%nLater on, you can use an arc furnace to make wrought iron ingots directly.%n%n

# Quest: Books
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD8A.name=§3§lBooks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD8A.desc=Books can be found easily enough in villages or in the roguelike dungeons surface brick house. I'm sure they have a recipe too.%n%nNow glue on the other hand...or should I say horse?

# Quest: Alumite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEZg.name=§3§lAlumite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEZg.desc=It's upgrade time again. You could in principle make alumite by mixing obsidian, steel and aluminium in the smeltery. But to get a much better yield, you can show you are a GregTech hero and search NEI for an alternate recipe using dusts. Alumite pickaxes are able to mine ardite in the Nether.%n%nLeave the rest of your Alumite as liquid in your smeltery, you'll want it to make the Tool Forge. You need 16 ingots in the smeltery to make 2 Large Plates.

# Quest: Reinforced X? Unbreakable
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEZw.name=§3§lReinforced X? Unbreakable
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEZw.desc=With your steel tool you are able to mine obsidian. You can make the Reinforcement which gives a reinforced modifier which increases the durability of your tool. Reinforced level X makes a tool unbreakable.%n%n§3PS: In many cases this is not worth it, since the tools don't degrade that fast, it doesn't cost much to repair, and you get better materials (with higher durability) to make them out of reasonably fast. Plus, by the time you got it to unbreakable, you'd be auto-mining everything with a miner anyway. Just use redstone, or maybe luck/silky. However, there are a few very nice use cases like lumber axes and tools for automation setups.

# Quest: Lapis? Lucky!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEaA.name=§4§3§lLapis? Lucky!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEaA.desc=Maybe you were lucky and received the luck modifier on your pickaxe. If not, you may still have an unused modifier on your pick so you can add some lapis lazuli. Or you can perhaps add another modifier by adding a diamond and a gold block to your pick and then add some lapis. %n%nYou can put the lapis lazuli in more than one slot in the tool station, use blocks to raise the luck level faster, and even use lapis blocks in the crafting station with your tool for maximum luck gain.%n%n§3Since it only affects small ore it might not be worth it to you to use. Also, if you lack in lapis, you can put 1 point on, and then mine stuff, and it will sometimes gain more points, up to the 450 limit.

# Quest: Extra Modifier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEag.name=§2§3§e§4§3§lExtra Modifier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEag.desc=If you don't have an extra modifier on your tool you can easily add one. A gold block and a diamond are all you need.%n%nYou can add two more modifiers, but you'll need to read the tinkers book yourself to know what to use.

# Quest: Nether Quartz? Sharpness!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEbA.name=§3§f§3§lNether Quartz? Sharpness!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEbA.desc=Your sword is too dull? Get some nether quartz to sharpen it.%n%nIf you have lots of Certus quartz, 1 piece of Certus is equal to 24 Nether quartz.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEew.name=§3§2§4§3§lGT6-Styled Wires and Cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEew.desc=They work basically the same as pipes, but you need wire cutters (or a soldering iron) instead of a wrench. Additionally, you take damage if they're not insulated (wire) but not if they are (cable).%n%nHint: If you click one wire or cable on the other it will auto-connect. Cables and pipes can be painted to make sure you do not cross your MV line with your EV line, or dump hot lava into your plastic water pipes. No boom today.%n%nHa ha just kidding there is always a boom today!

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGAA.desc=I've found a use for the Ectoplasm you can collect from spirits of the dead. It makes a very useful glass that you can walk on, but mobs cannot. However, they think they can! %n%nSo you can use this to create a moat around your base that drops mobs to the death in various ways, or just to shuttle them off somewhere else. Separate babies from mothers? Use it in a mob farm? Capture pigmen walking into the Overworld from your Nether portal? So many possibilities!

# Quest: Bowl Full of Spaghetti
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGxw.name=§3§lBowl Full of Spaghetti
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGxw.desc=Or at least factories full of item pipes. With these simple item pipes and conveyors you can take items out of one machine and feed them immediately into a second machine.%n%nLater on you can make better item pipes. Search for "item pipe" in NEI for options.%n%n§4You'll need a Steel Wrench to remove them. Don't place them down unless you're sure of the location until you have one.

# Quest: Nice Nether Trees

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHew.name=§3§lMud, Can Also be Used For Facials
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHew.desc=You may have found plenty of mud piles around the wetlands and thought of them as mere annoyances when jumping in the water or for that armor. Waste not! With your new extractor, you can pull out the clay hidden in the mud!

# Quest: Too Much Junk??
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHfw.name=§3§lToo Much Junk??
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHfw.desc=Impossible! But if you really want to get rid of excess items, make yourself a trashcan.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZQ.desc=Not really required, but it is a lot faster than the steam one and it can be automated. If you feel like ore washing is too slow, use this hammer.

# Quest: Cutting Things Apart
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZg.name=§5§lCutting Things Apart
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZg.desc=An absolutely mandatory machine to have. It will cut rods into bolts, plates into casings, logs into planks, and all of that will be done with the highest possible efficiency. Totally worth it! %n%nYou can use water, distilled water, or lubricant to run it. Use lubricant if possible, as it's the best.

# Quest: Getting Ready for Tier 2, MV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZw.name=§5§lGetting Ready for Tier 2, MV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZw.desc=In order to proceed forward, you need to get aluminium. A lot of it. But for now, 8 is enough to complete this quest.%n%nYour first option is alumina dust. Probably the best source for alumina is clay or hardened clay from canyons, however you need an MV machine for that, so you need to find an alternative until you have enough dust for your initial setup. For now, you can get it by centrifuging various impure piles from your ores or by smelting ruby, sapphire, or green sapphire in an EBF with carbon. Check the EBF quest in the Multiblock Goals.%n%nYou will also need an EBF to turn the alumina into aluminium ingots. For that you need cryolite. Go visit the Twilight Forest for that and find a Galena vein. The related quest is "Lead, Galena, Silver and Cryolite" is the Novice Thaumaturgy tab.%n%nYour second option is to use aluminium dust. However, you can not smelt that directly yet, even if you have an EBF. That will require higher heat levels. For now, you will have to either use a Tinker's Smeltery or a GT Compressor to turn the dust into raw aluminium which you can then smelt into ingots in the EBF. Check out the Tier 0 quest for some options to obtain the dust. %n%nBy the time you've completed this, you'll probably be done with most of the tab, but you'll still need Good Circuits (MV) to actually open up the next tier if you haven't done that yet.%n%nYou might also want to check the Getting Around and Without Dying tabs for new unlocks.%n%n§3If you were exploring Twilight Forest before 2.1.1.4 you won't find any cryolite in existing veins. You'll need to explore new chunks.

# Quest: Your Magic Progression
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaA.name=§5§lYour Magic Progression
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaA.desc=Now that you're able to produce Aluminium, you may dig into magic. If you haven't unlocked basic thaumaturgy, try to find a Silverwood and a Greatwood sapling.%n%nThere is a coin quest that lets you purchase these saplings. If you haven't found any yet, go check it out!

# Quest: Saving Metal With Bending
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaQ.name=§5§lSaving Metal With Bending
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaQ.desc=Instead of a 3:2 ratio of ingots to plates, this machine allows for 1:1. This saves an enormous amount of metal, so make it ASAP.%n%nBTW if you want foils, just run the plate back through. There's other circuit modes, but you can discover them later.

# Quest: Basic Transport Pipe
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcQ.name=§5§lBasic Transport Pipe
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcQ.desc=These pipes are rather simple and won't do anything on their own. But in combination with transfer nodes, you'll soon find out how great they are.

# Quest: Basic Transport: Items
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcg.name=§5§lBasic Transport: Items
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcg.desc=In order to transfer items, you need so called "nodes". There are some for pushing items into a pipe system, and later you'll have access to nodes that are able to pull items from attached inventories.

# Quest: Basic Transport: Fluids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcw.name=§5§lBasic Transport: Fluids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcw.desc=Just like item nodes, liquid nodes transfer... liquids. But probably the best thing: They can all utilize the same transfer pipe!

# Quest: Alloy Smelter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdA.name=§5§lAlloy Smelter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdA.desc=Upgrade your steam alloy smelter to an LV one.

# Quest: Gotta Catch 'em All
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdQ.name=§5§lGotta Catch 'em All
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdQ.desc=Sure, you can use wheat/potatoes/carrots to make animals follow you back to your base, but that can be tedious. A golden lasso is a proper solution for animal transportation.%n%nYou can use it for §oany§r passive mob, like for getting villagers back to base, or a horse across a river.

# Quest: Basic Monster Prevention
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdg.name=§5§lBasic Monster Prevention
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdg.desc=Monsters spawning in or near your base can be annoying. Especially if you happen to get infernal creepers. Luckily, there's a good way to prevent them from spawning at all.

# Quest: You're Gonna Hate This #5
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEQ.name=§5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #5
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEQ.desc=The fifth item you'll need a lot of. For the microwave, the scanner, the precision laser engraver, etc.%n%nThe Emitter and Sensor aren't used as much as the other items, fortunately.

# Quest: You're Gonna Hate This #6
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEg.name=§5§lYou're Gonna Hate This #6
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEg.desc=The sixth item you'll need a lot of. For the scanner and the seismic prospector.%n%n§3BTW, there's technically one more, the Field Generator, but you need higher tier circuits to make it, and it isn't used as often until later tiers.

# Quest: Scanning Bees, Crops and Moooooore!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEw.name=§5§lScanning Bees, Crops and Moooooore!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEw.desc=Automate your bee, sapling, or crop scanning. For crops, this is the only real way to find the crop's stats until you can craft the Portable Scanner, which needs HV circuits that you can make in the next tier.%n%nLater on, this machine gets very useful for scanning high tier machine parts for the assembly line research data or to fill data orbs with data for UUMatter production. Data sticks with raw prospecting data need a scanner too.

# Quest: Basic Ore Washer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGg.name=§5§lBasic Ore Washer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGg.desc=Macerating ores usually doubles the output. If you want MOOOOOOORE, craft an ore washer and wash out some rare materials.%n%nNote that these both use water, and are painfully slow.%n%nPut crushed ore in them.

# Quest: Round and Round and Round...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGw.name=§5§lRound and Round and Round...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGw.desc=After purification of your ore dust, you can centrifuge it to get even more byproducts out of the dust. On top of that, you can process many items into their more useful byproducts with this machine, such as Sticky Resin and Brick Dust. %n%nIt's always useful to check NEI for Centrifuge and Electrolyzer recipes for any item/fluid you may need. It might just be that you can get that from stuff you already have in your base!

# Quest: A Truly Sharp Saw Blade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHA.name=§5§lA Truly Sharp Saw Blade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHA.desc=Combining cobalt brass and diamond dust makes a really sharp saw blade for your cutting machine.%n%n§3This is the only use for cobalt brass in the game. Pretty pointless, yeah?

# Quest: A New Alloy - Cobalt Brass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHQ.name=§5§lA New Alloy - Cobalt Brass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHQ.desc=If you want to cut diamond blocks into plates, it's time to get a new alloy, Cobalt Brass.%n%nFirst you need to make brass out of zinc (only found in small ores in the Overworld, in Nether Sphalerite, or as a centrifuge byproduct from tin or tetrahedrite) and copper. Mix it with aluminium and cobalt dust (you can get it as a byproduct of a couple ores, go searching in the nether, or go to the Twilight Forest for Cobaltite) to get the cobalt brass dust.%n%nNow that you've come this far, we think that you're able to look up the ores that you need by yourself with the help of NEI.

# Quest: Electrically Separating Dusts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHg.name=§5§lElectrically Separating Dusts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHg.desc=Using the power of electricity you can get even more out of your dusts. Somehow. With no catalysts, electrolytes, or anything. Look, don't ask me how it works. §oIt just works§r.%n%nAside from that, this is a very important machine to process some items and fluids into other, more useful items and fluids. A basic example of this is electrolyzing Water, which should be completely free to you, to get both Hydrogen and Oxygen, two very important fluids for your progression.

# Quest: C9H8O4...NaCl...H2O...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHw.name=§5§lC9H8O4...NaCl...H2O...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACHw.desc=Want to make some cetane-boosted diesel, plastic or some chemical dyes? Then it's time to craft a chemical reactor.%n%nYou can use the battery slot and the other extra slot in the GUI to store items.

# Quest: Compact? Or is it?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIA.name=§5§lCompact? Or is it?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIA.desc=It's a compressor but that doesn't mean it's compact... %n%nIt is highly recommended to get one of these electric compressors, as the efficiency in terms of coal/steam used to compress something is a lot better when using EU.

# Quest: Suction Device... Nice
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIQ.name=§3§5§lSuction Device... Nice
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIQ.desc=I hope you're not thinking about what I'm thinking you're thinking about... %n%nIt's highly recommended to get one of these, as the efficiency in terms of coal/steam used to extracting something is a lot better when using EU.

# Quest: Your Oil is Too Crude? Refine it!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIw.name=§5§lYour Oil is Too Crude? Refine it!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIw.desc=Burning oil in the combustion generator is a very inefficient way of producing power. Every bucket/cell of oil only gives you 20,000 EU. Time to refine it.%n%nYou'll need to use a circuit to pick which of the products you want. Later on you can make a Distillation Tower to get all of them, but that's far away for now.%n%nYou can also distill many other fluids! There are two that are useful, but take a long time to distill, so you should set them up in advance:%nLubricant (from Creosote) and Distilled Water (from Water).

# Quest: Light Sulfuric Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJA.name=§5§lLight Sulfuric Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJA.desc=You can distill your oil into light sulfuric fuel, that has a burn value of 40,000 EU.

# Quest: Light Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJQ.name=§5§lLight Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJQ.desc=By adding Hydrogen to Sulfuric Light Fuel in a Chemical Reactor you can produce Light Fuel with the very high burn value of 305,000 EU per cell. It is also the main component of Diesel, an excellent fuel that becomes available in MV%n%nThe remaining Hydrogen Sulfide can be used to produce Sulfuric Acid for, well, tons of stuff. You can never have enough of it! You can also crack Light Fuel in a Chemical Reactor and then distill it to get Ethylene, for Polyethylene. But Refinery Gas is better for that.

# Quest: H for Hydrogen... the Rest of the Alphabet is Too Complicated...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJg.name=§5§lH for Hydrogen... the Rest of the Alphabet is Too Complicated...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJg.desc=Centrifuge some brown or yellow limonite dust, or use an Electrolyser with water to get some hydrogen.%n%nThere are many other ways of obtaining hydrogen which you might want to look into. Some are only available much later.%n%nExamples are: chemical processing or electrolysis of methane obtained from organic sources, electrolysis of water or salt water, mixing sodium with water, or eventually siphoning hydrogen directly from a gas giant.

# Quest: Heavy Sulfuric Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJw.name=§5§lHeavy Sulfuric Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACJw.desc=You can distill your oil into heavy sulfuric fuel, that has a burn value of 40,000 EU.

# Quest: Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKA.name=§5§lHeavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKA.desc=By adding Hydrogen to sulfuric Heavy Fuel in a Chemical Reactor you can produce Heavy Fuel, with a burn value of 240,000 EU per cell! Aside from this, it's also required for Diesel, in MV, which is a better fuel, and it can also be distilled into three very useful fluids: Benzene, Toluene and Phenol.%n%nIf you want to use Heavy Fuel as a power source, you will need Semi-Fluid generators, unlike Light Fuel and Diesel which use Combustion generators.%n%nIt's honestly not especially efficient to make Heavy Fuel out of regular Oil. You should try to get Heavy Oil to make it, like from Oilsands Ore in MV once you can. Then use it to make Diesel.

# Quest: Hey DJ, Mix it!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKg.name=§5§lHey DJ, Mix it!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKg.desc=The mixer is a very useful device. You can mix all kinds of fluids and items. Useful to prevent dust from falling to the ground when crafting - most mixer recipes give a slight boost over hand crafting!%n%nYou get +3 slots in the EV+ versions, this one has 6.%n%nYou can use the battery slot and other extra slots in the GUI to store anything you like!

# Quest: N Like Nitrogen... Hide, the Alphabet Strikes Again!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKw.name=§5§lN Like Nitrogen... Hide, the Alphabet Strikes Again!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKw.desc=You can get some nitrogen by centrifuging... air. This process takes a long time, especially at LV tier.%n%nYou get that air from compressed air cells, which are gotten from running cells through a compressor. Each one contains 2000L, unlike a normal cell that contains 1000L.

# Quest: Molten Redstone?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQw.name=§5§lMolten Redstone?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQw.desc=You heard that the carpenter needs some molten redstone for a few recipes. Converting redstone dust into a fluid requires a fluid extractor. Let's build one.%n%nIf you want to get that molten redstone into a cell, you'll need a fluid canner instead of a GT tank. Why? Because Reasons.%n%nFortunately, most fluids work properly, but redstone, cracked fluids, and certain other ones do not. Or just use a universal cell.

# Quest: Magnetize Your Rods
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACSw.name=§5§lMagnetize Your Rods
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACSw.desc=Magnetic steel rods will §oneed§r a polariser to craft. You'll need them later on for MV Motors and MV hatches.

# Quest: Tetrahedrite, Stibnite and Copper
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVQ.name=§5§lTetrahedrite, Stibnite and Copper
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVQ.desc=Maybe you're wondering why you need tetrahedrite or stibnite. Well, antimony can be centrifuged out of it which is very useful for batteries. Batteries store power, so you can have highs and lows in your power production while still outputting stable power.%n%nThe veins can be found between Y level 80-120.

# Quest: Antimony
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVg.name=§5§lAntimony
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVg.desc=The most efficient way to get antimony for batteries is to run stibnite through a BBF or EBF, burning off the impurities (sulfur), and giving you more antimony. You can also centrifuge it if you want to keep the sulfur. You can also centrifuge tetrahedrite dust if you're desperate.

# Quest: Thermal Centrifuge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVw.name=§5§lThermal Centrifuge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVw.desc=A machine to get different byproducts out of your crushed or purified ore dust. It's useful for getting a bit of Gallium out of crushed Zinc Ore for your Diodes needed in good circuits.%n%nWhen you have IC2 nuclear reactors and want to recycle your depleted fuel rods, it's the only way to do so.%n%nIf you can't produce the 2A of LV power for this machine right now, wait until you get to MV and use transformers to power an LV version.%n%nIn LV, you can obtain the same ore byproducts via different methods. The Thermal Centrifuge only becomes really important in HV when you can combine it with the HV macerator.%n%n§4Sending MV power to an LV device, even if it uses more than 1A will cause an explosion, so don't do that.

# Quest: A Lead About Lead That Leads to Lead
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACYA.name=§2§3§5§lA Lead About Lead That Leads to Lead
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACYA.desc=The next step of making batteries is to collect some lead. Look at the lead quest in the novice thaumaturgy tab for more info.

# Quest: Mercury
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaA.name=§5§lMercury
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaA.desc=Mercury can be centrifuged out of redstone. If you find some cinnabar ore in a redstone vein or one of the infused stone veins you can use that too.

# Quest: Fluid Canner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaQ.name=§5§lFluid Canner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaQ.desc=The fluid canner used to be the main way to fill cells, single-use batteries, and coolant cells. It was needed because direct interaction with cells was limited.%n%nNow everything is much easier and cells almost always work as expected, so you likely won't need this, even for molten redstone.%n%nHowever, if you want an electric hoe or treetap, you'll need to make IC2 batteries in a fluid canner.%n%nAnother interesting thing about this is it also works as a fluid uncanner. And maybe later you could fill a Lighter with it.

# Quest: Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACag.name=§5§lSulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACag.desc=Combining sulfur trioxide and water in the chemical reactor will give you sulfuric acid for your single use acid batteries. You'll need to make sulfur dioxide first.%n%nOn the other hand if you've made some light fuel you'll have some spare hydrogen sulfide you can also turn into sulfuric acid (after a couple steps), and if you've automated it, you'll be drowning in it honestly. Once you can make an LCR, you can skip directly from HS to SA in one step. Keep in mind that you'll need all that acid for making stuff instead of for single use batteries by then.

# Quest: IC2 Battery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACbA.name=§5§lIC2 Battery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACbA.desc=A few recipes require IC2 batteries. Fill your small battery hull with some molten redstone and you'll get an RE-Battery.

# Quest: How to Get Sodium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACbQ.name=§6§5§lHow to Get Sodium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACbQ.desc=A second source for sodium is glauconite ore or glauconite sand. This type of ore vein can be found at Y level 20-50.%n%nSoapstone and talc can be used for lubricant.

# Quest: How to Get Sodium and Lithium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACbg.name=§5§lHow to Get Sodium and Lithium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACbg.desc=Salt ore mixes can be found in the Overworld between Y 50-70.%n%nSalt isn't only used to get sodium, it's an important ingredient in many pam's harvestcraft food recipes.%n%nLepidolite and spodumene are good sources of lithium for your batteries. Later on you can get a lot more in different ways.

# Quest: Cadmium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACbw.name=§5§lCadmium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACbw.desc=You can get Cadmium from Sphalerite (centrifuge or thermal centrifuge). Later on you can use GT++ Ore processing chains to get Cadmium from Rare Earths. I don't care how you get it, just get some Cadmium.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACcA.name=§5§lBasic Canner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACcA.desc=The canning machine is used to fill batteries, fill cells with stuff (usually dust, not used that often), or to fill tin cans with any kind of food (HV+).%n%nAt LV-HV tier you can make batteries with sodium, cadmium, or lithium.

# Quest: Portable Mob Spawners..? Cool!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACcg.name=§5§lPortable Mob Spawners..? Cool!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACcg.desc=Do you want to move a spawner around and build a cool mob farm? That will be no problem if you get the diamond dolly. You can move 6 spawners before the durability runs out, which is probably more than you'll need right now.

# Quest: Sulfuric Naphtha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACfw.name=§5§lSulfuric Naphtha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACfw.desc=Another distillate you can make out of oil is sulfuric naphtha with a burn value of 40,000 EU per cell in the gas turbine.

# Quest: Naphtha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgQ.name=§5§lNaphtha
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgQ.desc=You can process Sulfuric Naphtha to fluid Naphtha which has a burn value of 320,000 EU in the Gas Turbine. Naphtha can be used to get Ethylene for Polyethylene, but it shares this use with Refinery Gas and Light Fuel, so decide for yourself which one you want to use. %n%nIf you choose to make High-Octane Gasoline in EV and onwards, it will need a lot of Naphtha. You can also make Polycaprolactam (Nylon), which doesn't have any useful purpose yet, but it might get some in the near future.

# Quest: Sulfuric Gas
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgg.name=§5§lSulfuric Gas
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgg.desc=Another distillate for your gas turbine you can make out of oil is sulfuric gas with a burn value of 25,000 EU per cell.

# Quest: Refinery Gas
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgw.name=§5§lRefinery Gas
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACgw.desc=Refine your gas in a chemical reactor with Hydrogen gas to give it a better burn value of 160,000 EU. It used to be the least useful fraction of oil, but it's now possible to distill it into large amounts of Ethylene if you steam-crack the Refinery Gas beforehand.%n%nThis early, you will have to use a Chemical Reactor to crack it, but later on there's a dedicated multiblock for this purpose, the Oil Cracker. For best Ethylene results, you should severely steam-crack it, and you will get lots of Methane as well.

# Quest: Methane
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAChA.name=§5§lMethane
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAChA.desc=Distilling some "refinery gases" gives you some methane gas. There are many more (and probably better) ways to get methane.%n%nYou will need this in later tiers, for PTFE as an example.

# Quest: Electrotine Battery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAChg.name=§5§lElectrotine Battery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAChg.desc=The electrotine battery is exclusively used in project red machines and the jetpack. Electrotine is made by mixing redstone and electrum dust in a mixer, or mined from the Nether.

# Quest: Basic Arc Furnace
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAClg.name=§5§lBasic Arc Furnace
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAClg.desc=The arc furnace is an alternative to macerating stuff back into dusts and for making wrought iron, annealed copper, and glass (in MV). You get ingots, and sometimes different materials back from recycling than with a macerator. You also have all 4 slots at LV. The recipes use oxygen and 3A of power.%n%nJust ignore the plasma one.%n%nAnd §4no§r, you can't just send 1A of MV. That will blow it up.

# Quest: Faster Steel Production
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAClw.name=§5§lFaster Steel Production
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAClw.desc=A faster alternative to steel production is to use the arc furnace and smelt iron ingots (or dust) into wrought iron ingots. Then macerate them to dust and smelt them very fast in the EBF to steel.%n%nOf course, you'll need enough oxygen to do so.

# Quest: LV Extruder
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACoQ.name=§5§lLV Extruder
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACoQ.desc=The extruder is not very useful in LV. But it will extrude your next tier of boat, make rubber sheets more efficiently, get you extra fluid cells, or make §osome§r Tinkers Construct tool parts.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzA.desc=For the emitter and the sensor you'll need to get some certus quartz.

# Quest: Good Circuits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzQ.name=§4§3§5§lGood Circuits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzQ.desc=Good circuits are an improvement on basic circuits. They're an MV-tier circuit, which is a component of all MV gregtech machines.%n%nTo open MV, you still need to make an EBF and do the Aluminium quest if you haven't already, since §oeverything§r needs aluminium.%n%nThis quest also opens the Project Red quests - one of the early automation options.

# Quest: Chemical Rubber Production
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC1g.name=§5§lChemical Rubber Production
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC1g.desc=A much more efficient way to make insulated cables is by making molten rubber in a chemical reactor, which can be applied to a cable in the assembling machine. When you put both machines next to each other you can output the molten rubber directly to the assembling machine by clicking the fluid auto-output button on the chemical reactor. Make sure to set the correct side of the reactor as output side by wrenching it. Also remember to use the right circuit in the assembling machine.

# Quest: Glue
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6Q.name=§5§lGlue
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6Q.desc=To make Good Circuit Boards, you need either glue or refined glue. %n%nYou can obtain refined glue either by centrifuging sticky resin or distilling glue.

# Quest: Diodes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6w.name=§5§lDiodes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6w.desc=Good circuits need diodes. There are two main ways to craft them. You can crush the Gallium Arsenide crystals to dust and combine that with fine copper wires and molten glass. Once you have solar grade silicon you can use it to make silicon wafers in your EBF to make even more. Note that the wafers are much more efficient on gallium and arsenic, so even a reduced amount is still worth it.%n%nMake sure you check all the NEI recipes for advanced items instead of just using the first one you find. You can use annealed copper wires and polyethylene to increase your output even more. %n

# Quest: Empty Circuit Board
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC7A.name=§5§lEmpty Circuit Board
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC7A.desc=Good circuit boards require wooden pulp and refined glue to make phenolic circuit boards. By adding gold wire you can craft a good circuit board.%n%nThere are more efficient ways to make it if you look in NEI.

# Quest: Analyzing the Soil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_w.name=§5§lAnalyzing the Soil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_w.desc=Tired of looking for ores by hand? Want to find underground oil that will last a long time? A seismic prospector will tell you the ores in the surrounding chunks in a (sorta) handy book you can read, and also the underground fluids beneath you. It doesn't need to be powered.§r%n%nTo determine which kind of fluid there is in the chunk you need to scan the soil by right clicking an Advanced Seismic Prospector with 2 Powderbarrels, 4 Glyceryl Trinitate cells, 8 iTNT or 16 TNT. This one doesn't explode the user too on use. Features! Make sure you wait a few seconds after placing the prospector before applying the explosives. Otherwise, §4Boom!§r There are four types of oil or natural gas for the overworld. See the quest in Tips and Tricks once you've made an oil drill.%n%n1) Right click explosives.%n2) Use a single Data Stick to extract the data by right clicking on it after the animation has finished. Each will hold ONE result.%n3) Next you need to put the data stick in a GT scanner to have it analyzed.%n4) Place the analyzed data stick in the bottom right slot of a printer and add 3 paper in the top left slot and make sure you have at least 144L squid ink in it.%n5) Take the printed pages and combine it with a piece of leather in an assembling machine filled with at least 20 mb of refined glue.%n%n§3TADA!§r Now you have a book with detailed info about the chunks you scanned. Visual Prospecting adds the information to your map the moment you make the book.%n%n§2Data Sticks are not easy (or possible) to make right now, so do not lose them.§r You can put it in a crafting table to erase it when done.%n%nOre locations are given as the center of the chunk. Ores that are marginal in that chunk may not be found in the center but on an edge. Look at where ores are located and determine the center of the vein. At higher tiers, it scans more chunks for ores. If you just want to know about fluids, use the lower tier version so the book isn't as long.%n%nEach underground fluid field is 8x8 chunks. This starts at 0,0 and continues for 8 chunks east and south, containing 64 chunks. Not all fields have anything in them though. Within the field the amount can vary +/- 25 percent. The amount reported in the book is the minimum and maximum per field across all chunks in the field. The prospector reports on 3x3 fields (as in, 9 fields of 8x8 chunks) at all tiers with the center field where the seismic prospector is located. Fluid extraction rate depends on many factors, check the wiki for details. In general, anything above 300 is really good. The total amount in the chunk is complicated. %n%n

# Quest: Dust to Crystals

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAw.desc=Use the autoclave to crystallize your dust. You can also make Raw Carbon Fibre out of Carbon Dust, and do other things.

# Quest: Basic Circuit Assembler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADGw.name=§5§lBasic Circuit Assembler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADGw.desc=Advanced (HV) circuits require an LV circuit assembling machine. Basic (LV) and Good (MV) ones can also be made much more efficiently with this machine. %n%nHowever, all circuit assemblers need higher tier circuits than the other machines of their tier. This means you have to use MV circuits instead of the LV ones you've been using until now. I know you want it, so make it already!

# Quest: Gallium Arsenide Crystal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADRA.name=§5§lGallium Arsenide Crystal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADRA.desc=The diode requires gallium arsenide, and you may be wondering how to get gallium or arsenic this early in the game.%n%nSphalerite and zinc are the primary sources of gallium at this tier.%n%nYou can find sphalerite in sulfur veins at Y 5-20, and the small zinc ores in the Overworld or the in the Nether at Y 80-210. You won't find much on the Overworld because of obvious reasons. To get additional zinc crushed ore drops, use a Tinker's Construct tool with the Luck (Fortune) enchant on it, probably the best use for all that lapis you got while looking for calcite. Or use a miner, if you don't mind how slow it is.%n%n- Sphalerite can be electrolyzed for a small chance of a gallium dust. Better put in a lot or you might get unlucky.%n- Zinc crushed ore can be washed and then thermal centrifuged or forge hammered and then centrifuged. But you don't always get the crushed ore as a drop, the impure dust doesn't give gallium.%n%nYou can get arsenic from realgar small ores in the Nether at Y 15-85. Centrifuge the dusts in a centrifuge.%n%nOther sources are Tinker's Construct cobalt ore in the nether and cobaltite ore in the Twilight Forest. You can use your EBF for that. You also need to level up your pickaxe to ardite or make an Ironwood Pickaxe or LV Miner to harvest cobalt ore.%n%nAnother way to get gallium and arsenic is with XP buckets in a crafting grid if you're really desperate.%n%nWith your EBF you can combine these two dusts to make a Gallium Arsenide Crystal.

# Quest: Handle Tiny Piles Like a K1ng
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADRw.name=§5§6§l§5§lHandle Tiny Piles Like a K1ng
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADRw.desc=Don't you hate having to manually compress all those tiny piles? Well, let me show you how to automate that. A combination of type filter, chest buffer (or super buffer in HV) and packager frees you from that annoying task. The chestbuffer can hold up to 9 stacks of tiny piles and the super buffer can hold 256 stacks of tiny dusts, which is more than enough. You can set its mode with a screwdriver on the output side. Set it to 9 to export 9 tiny piles at a time and let the packager compress these into regular dusts.%n%nSuper buffers can be lag sources, so be careful to keep them as empty as possible. If you're using a multiblock packager, be sure to change the buffer from Stocking mode to Transfer Size mode.

# Quest: Butane and Propane
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADSA.name=§5§lButane and Propane

Well then it's time for you to make a Sifting Machine.%n%nYou can find small Zinc ores (look in NEI) or you can search the Nether for Sphalerite.%n%nThe Sifter only takes Purified ores, but you can get these easily by throwing Crushed ores into a Cauldron with water.%n%n§3Note that you need Polyethlene to make this machine!

# Quest: GT Tanks, the LV Version
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADew.name=§5§lGT Tanks, the LV Version
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADew.desc=The next version of GT tanks stores 64,000L in a tank. It actually requires a pump this time, so it's a little expensive. Consider staying with your ULV ones if you only need basic I/O.

# Quest: GT MV Tank...Already?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADfA.name=§5§lGT MV Tank...Already?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADfA.desc=These store 128,000L. The dark steel plates and LV pump make it a little annoying to make, since it needs an EBF.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADgg.desc=Too lazy to make an ore washer, yet bored with your non-automatable cauldron? Then the simple washer is the machine for you! It works much faster than a normal ore washer. Of course, you don't get any byproducts, but who cares!%n%nThere are simple washers for every tier up to UV, but the speed doesn't increase much past the HV version. 

# Quest: Auto Mining
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADog.name=§5§lAuto Mining
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADog.desc=Automatic mining in LV tier? Wow! This nifty machine will collect ores for you, which can be helpful especially in the Nether, as it won't anger pigmen.%n%nPlace up to two stacks of mining pipes in the right slots. Each pipe can go 1 block, and allow the miner to dig 1 block further. If you're above Y64, you may need to pipe more in.%n%nThis machine only needs 8 EU/t to work, so LV batteries in a batbuff work ok if you don't want to make another generator.%n%nThe miner searches for ores in a 17x17 block work area (adjustable with a screwdriver), and comes with a level 1 fortune bonus! Great for gathering additional small ores!%n%nDon't forget to cover it up! These are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on all sides. And set a waypoint with JourneyMap so you don't forget where you placed it if you place it far away! You'll need to chunkload the miner if you want it to keep working when you're not there.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECw.desc=Want to use all that delicious XP to raise your levels? Move the tank with XP above you and attach this convenient shower head to take the XP from the tank.%n%nThis thing can be laggy, so be careful about letting too many xp orbs out of the tank. Apply a RS signal to turn it off.

# Quest: Lubricant
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEPA.name=§5§lLubricant
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEPA.desc=Using lubricant instead of water or distilled water in your cutting machines will increase their speed.%n%nYou can make lubricant out of oil, seed oil, fish oil or creosote in a distillery (or distillation tower later on). If you're able to craft a brewery you can use talc or soapstone to get much more lubricant each cycle.%n%nLube cells are required to make low tier energy hatches, so stockpile a few cells and use the rest to make your cutting machine faster.

# Quest: Time to Dry Out the Nether
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQg.name=§5§lTime to Dry Out the Nether
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQg.desc=Pumps can do more than pump oil and water. You can go to the nether and pump lava from the huge lava lakes too.%n%nOnce you reach HV, lava can be centrifuged for Silicon Dioxide, Magnesia, Quicklime, Gold, Sapphire, and Tantalite. You can get Silicon, Magnesium, Calcium, Gold, Aluminium, Manganese, Tantalum, and Oxygen out of them.%n%nThis is a good use for your LV pumps once you upgrade to MV pumps for oil. If you get into Thaumcraft or Blood Magic, there are ways to produce lava with magic unlimitedly and easily too.%n%n§3You'll want either ULV tanks and cells, or BC tanks and a dolly to transport your lava.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEfQ.name=§5§lA New Alloy - Magnalium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEfQ.desc=Wondering why you need magnalium now? It's not for GT machines but for a material update for your crossbow.%n%nYou already made some Aluminium dust before. Getting Aluminium will become easier once you get an EBF or MV electrolyzer.%n%nCombine Aluminium and Magnesium in your alloy smelter to get Magnalium.

# Quest: Basic Fluid Solidifier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgw.name=§5§lBasic Fluid Solidifier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgw.desc=To get your molten fluids back to a solid state you need a fluid solidifier.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFBQ.desc=Diamond Spikes damages mobs (or you!) that touch any side of it other than the bottom. With 7 attack damage, the Spike does as much damage as a Diamond Sword. Mobs will not walk around the block, but will try to walk over it as if it were a regular solid block. Most explosions won't destroy the Spike because it has a very high blast resistance.%n%nThese can also be enchanted with all the enchantments a regular diamond sword would receive. This includes Looting and Sharpness, which function exactly as it does on a sword. Interestingly, mobs killed by the Diamond Spike will return experience as if killed by the player.%n%nThere are weaker versions, but who wants that? If you happen to want the last hit, you might want the wooden ones though.

# Quest: Chemical Bath

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF5g.desc=Tired of searching all over the map for that Bamboo Forest or Tropical Rainforest? Desperate for clay dust and need to find a Canyon or Mesa biome? Nature's compass will lead you to the biome you're looking for, if it's within its range.%n%nThe compass menu has the following functionality:%n* When Sorted By: Name, you can filter the list by name or its parts. The search is case-insensitive.%n* You can search by keys and their combinations. For instance, name: bamboo, climate: warm, bh: -1.8, tag: forest.%nAll available keys are: %nname, %nclimate [hellish, hot, warm, normal, cold, icy], %nbaseheight | bh (float, can be negative),%nheightvariation | hv (float), %nrainfall | rain (float), %ntemperature | temp (float), %nhumidity [damp, normal, arid],%ntags.%n%nSome things to keep in mind:%n* Biomes from other dimensions show up on the list, don't bother searching for those unless you're in that dimension.%n* In general, the full list has biomes that are not generated by Realistic World Generator, like Sunflower Plains.%n* Radius 10000 means it couldn't find the biome. In this case after the initial search, its menu will show only the biomes in the 10k radius. Use Shift+RMB to see the whole list again.%n* You can try again at a different location - the range is 10k from your current position.%n* Artificially created biomes count, so remove them if you want to find a natural one.%n* There's lots of different 'versions' of biomes under the same category, so if you want a tropical one for tropical bees, there's actually a bunch of places you can get it.%n* For those who don't mind the freeze when searching, the radius can be changed in a config. The HUD position can also be changed in the config.

# Quest: Portable Tanks Too Small?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF7w.name=§4§5§lPortable Tanks Too Small?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF7w.desc=How about large steel fluid cells instead? Each holds 8000L, and they can stack to 64. Unfortunately, you have to load and unload them using a machine's interface - like ULV tanks for example - but hey, 512 buckets in a single slot is pretty good!%n%nYou cannot use these cells directly in the world, like BC tanks, or to dump the fluid on the ground.

# Quest: Enderman Smelterman
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHSQ.name=§5§lEnderman Smelterman
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHSQ.desc=Need enderpearls? Getting them by killing endermen can be dangerous. Instead of doing that, put an enderman into a smeltery with hot fluids and use a gem cast to get guaranteed pearls. %n%nThe higher the hit points, the longer they'll last, so the more pearls you get. If you can find a regenerating enderman, or an enderman spawner, you'll have all the pearls you would ever want. Later on with EnderIO you can even create your own powered spawner to make endermen on-demand. Or just place it in the End and move the mobs inside.%n%nUse a nametag on a regenerating enderman to make sure he doesn't despawn. You'll want to keep him from seeing the sky or else he'll teleport away.%n%nIf you haven't found a regen enderman yet, you can buy enderman spawn eggs to put into your smeltery with coins.

# Quest: Choices, Choices
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIXw.name=§5§lChoices, Choices
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIXw.desc=Need a map on fuel choices? Well, we don't have that, but we have suggestions. You can use Steam up to IV, but beyond MV it gets pretty painful. %n%nIn LV you can start refining oil for either Light Fuel for a Combustion Generator or Refinery Gas for a Gas Turbine. Or you can use Creosote in a Semi-Fluid Generator.%n%nOnce you hit MV, you can switch from Steam to renewable Benzene (Gas) from your logs. Other renewable alternatives are Fish Oil or Seed Oil based bio diesel (combustion). Seed Oil can be sourced from Pam's peanuts, IC2 Rape crop or Forestry tree nuts.%n%nAt MV you can also upgrade your Light Fuel with Heavy Fuel to get Diesel. When you reach HV turn diesel or bio diesel into Cetane Boosted Diesel. In EV, you can make High Octane Gasoline (HOG), but it's complex, and you'll need to rejigger your whole oil distillation setup, since it uses different fluids than Cetane does.%n%nEV introduces the Large Gas Turbine, Large Steam Turbine, Large HP Steam Turbine, and Large Combustion Engine, which are more efficient versions of the earlier ones. The first 3 require turbines. %n%nYou can also make Nukes, or Wind and Water Kinetics.%n%nFor low-power operations, or dedicated players willing to setup autocrafting, you can begin using Solar Panels at MV.

# Quest: Fertilized Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJWQ.name=§5§lFertilized Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJWQ.desc=With a Chemical Reactor, you can make Fertilized Earth. It ticks faster than normal farmland, so crops will mature much faster.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJYw.desc=The time may come when you finally decide you have enough of a fluid. This overflow cover lets you tune how full a tank can get. You can put it on a smaller tank leading to a bigger tank, and when the bigger tank gets full, the fluid will backup into the smaller tank. Once the fluid level in the smaller tank exceeds the setting on the cover, it will start voiding fluid.%n%nHandy for an oxygen centrifuge setup when you don't want to stop from excess nitrogen.

# Quest: Long Distance Fluid Pipeline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJjA.name=§5§lLong Distance Fluid Pipeline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJjA.desc=Wouldn't it be great if you could transport your oil from a far away oil spout or oil field by pipes to your base?%n%nThis is not a problem anymore. Connect your setup on the start and end point with a Long Distance Fluid Pipeline block. Inbetween use the associated pipe blocks - the total distance between endpoints must be more than 64 blocks apart (4 or more chunks). There can only be one start and end point per pipeline.%n%nTo actually connect it, you need to align the start LDFP block such that the arrows are facing inwards, and the opposite side of it has a LDFPP block. Put a pump on the side of the block that has the arrows and set to import. It will now attempt to import fluid to the endpoint LDFP. §2This will go as fast as you can put fluid into it.§r%n%nDo the opposite on the far side, except you don't need a pump.%n%nNow you only need to chunkload the start and end points and the fluid will be "teleported" to you.%n%nOf course, later on you'll probably use ender tanks to §oactually§r teleport the fluid, especially from other dims.%n%nThis setup is lag-free in the pipe blocks, so it's useful in your base as well if you want to reduce lag.

# Quest: Chlorine, Your New Best Friend
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiQ.name=§5§lChlorine, Your New Best Friend
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiQ.desc=Chlorine is a fluid that is used in significant quantities throughout the game, so you might as well get used to collecting it now.%n%nYou can electrolyse Salt, Rock Salt, Sodalite (finally a use!), or Salt Water for it. Since you'll need so much, you may wish to consider using your first Super Tank to hold it all.

# Quest: Faster Steam Transportation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIQ.name=§5§lFaster Steam Transportation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIQ.desc=Do you think that steam fluid transport is far too slow? Your LV pumps got you down, doing only 640L/s? Then it's time to make the 32 times faster LV steam valves!%n%nThey only work with steam and are just as fast as the valve on a Railcraft tank (if you put it on the bottom side).%n%nThere are also MV, HV, EV, and IV versions.

# Quest: Long Distance Item Pipeline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIg.name=§5§lLong Distance Item Pipeline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIg.desc=Wouldn't it be great if you could transport ores from a far away ore vein by pipes to your base?%n%nThis is not a problem anymore. Connect your setup on the start and end point with a Long Distance Item Pipeline block. Inbetween use the associated pipe blocks - the total distance between endpoints must be more than 64 blocks apart (4 or more chunks). There can only be one start and end point per pipeline.%n%nTo actually connect it, you need to align the start LDIP block such that the arrows are facing inwards, and the opposite side of it has a LDIPP block. Put a conveyor on the side of the block that has the arrows and set to import. It will now attempt to import stuff to the endpoint LDIP. This will go as fast as you can put items into it.§r%n%nDo the opposite on the far side, except you don't need a conveyor.%n%nNow you only need to chunkload the start and end points and the items will be "teleported" to you.%n%nOf course, later on you'll probably use ender chests to §oactually§r teleport the ore, especially from other dims.%n%nThis setup is lag-free in the pipe blocks, so it's useful in your base as well if you want to reduce lag.

# Quest: Prison Gangs are Obsolete
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLQ.name=§5§lPrison Gangs are Obsolete
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLQ.desc=Want lots of cobble, stone, or obsidian? This is the machine for you!%n%nCobble: Water and lava on 2 of the sides.%nStone: Water on a side, lava on top.%nObsidian: Either of the above, and redstone in the machine.%n%nYou of course need to power it. If you don't want to spend power on cobble, do it the ExU way with the WIU.%n%nYou need to toggle the ghost circuit to circuit 1 to get obsidian.%n

# Quest: Magnets != Magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALSw.name=§5§lMagnets != Magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALSw.desc=Tired of running after ore or other blocks? Use a magnet! It has a limited range, but who cares? Just remember to turn it on.%n%nIn HV you can craft it into the better one, if you still need a magnet by then.

# Quest: Cobalt and Arsenic from Cobaltite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALYg.name=§d§0§5§lCobalt and Arsenic from Cobaltite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALYg.desc=Can't find any Cobalt in the Nether? Too lazy to bother finding some Ironwood in the Twilight Forest, even though it's super duper easy?%n%nYou can make it with your EBF now using Cobaltite Ore from the Twilight Forest and Oxygen to get Cobalt. It's a little complicated, but you also get arsenic out of it.%n%nYou can also just electrolyze it out in MV, which is what you §oshould§r be doing instead of this, but assuming you actually need it this method has higher yields (at the cost of carbon of course).

# Quest: Damascus Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALYw.name=§5§lDamascus Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALYw.desc=Damascus Steel is one of the hardest materials you can get, at your current tier. It's time to craft a stack of Damascus Steel.%n%nYou can't get it through the Mixer yet, but there is a crafting recipe.

# Quest: Aluminium Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALow.name=§5§6§l§5§lAluminium Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALow.desc=If you make some Double Aluminium Plates, you can make a new 96,000L single block tank.

# Quest: Mica Ore
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALpw.name=§5§lMica Ore
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALpw.desc=Mica is a very rare but useful ore. You need it in order to craft your coils for the Electric Blast Furnace. Only for cupronickel coils there is a replacement recipe. If you have no luck in finding this vein yet try to look for it with a Prospector once you get them.


## Quest Line: Tier 2 - MV
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABA.name=Tier 2 - MV
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABA.desc=Your second voltage tier. Don't mix different voltage levels, or you'll have a fancy new crater. Start thinking about how to expand your base. %n%nBTW, for OCing purposes, this counts as tier 2, ULV doesn't count.

# Quest: Electrolyzing All the Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAfg.name=§6§lElectrolyzing All the Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAfg.desc=Collected a lot of dusts you can't do anything with since you started with macerating, washing and centrifuging ores? It's finally time to get all the useful materials out of them.%n%nThis machine is §overy §o§rimportant for your MV progression. If you find a biome with tons of Stained or Hardened Clay, you can process it here, plus some other machines, into Sodium, Lithium, Silicon, Aluminium and Oxygen!

# Quest: IO, IO, It's Off to EnderIO We Go
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgA.name=§6§lIO, IO, It's Off to EnderIO We Go
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgA.desc=You've probably used EnderIO before. It's quite useful for a lot of things. But the recipes are different and it's not as useful for some things like ore processing. Let's go through what it has to offer. Note that the other half is in HV.

# Quest: Machine Chassis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgQ.name=§6§lMachine Chassis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgQ.desc=All EnderIO machines still require the basic chassis, and it's almost the same recipe as before; Except that you need plates instead of ingots. But that shouldn't be a problem at all...

# Quest: Portable Tanks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgg.name=§6§lPortable Tanks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgg.desc=Until now, you had to use buildcraft tanks with dollies to carry liquids around. Which can be a pain with all that slowness. These portable tanks from EnderIO are able to push and pull liquids by themselves, as they have a built-in pump which is powered by some magic energy source. How convenient.%n%nThe pressurized versions are twice as large.%n%n§3Just be careful, because it will eat water cells instead of returning them. 

# Quest: Simple RF power: Solid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgw.name=§6§lSimple RF power: Solid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgw.desc=By simply burning coal as fuel, this machine produces RF power. Enough for a basic machine setup. This machine will also accept compressed and multiple-compressed blocks. Want to burn something for 250+ days? Also, with double or octadic capacitors the output will increase and efficiency will improve.%n%nGT wiring can convert EU to RF, but not the other way around. Note that with the eNet changes a GT wire network will need at least one GT energy consumer - a machine hull of the matching voltage will work.%n%nEnder IO machines and GT cables and Wires can be left safely out in the rain.%n%nIt might be useful for Genetics machines since they consume excessive power when attached to GT wiring - Forestry and EnderIO machines work fine (except for the Thermionic Fabricator). Or use a Capacitor Bank.

# Quest: Simple RF Power: Liquids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhA.name=§6§lSimple RF Power: Liquids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhA.desc=This generator requires both water as coolant, and a burnable liquid as fuel.

# Quest: Conduits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhg.name=§6§lConduits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhg.desc=Probably the most awesome way to transport just about anything in multiple different ways. Get some conduits of each type. Higher tiers of each (except item) exist.%n%n§3There's also ME conduits for when you can do that.

# Quest: Yet Another Wrench
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhw.name=§6§lYet Another Wrench
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhw.desc=The Yeta Wrench is more than just a regular wrench. While holding it, you are able to switch between conduit types, eventually allowing you to remove one specific conduit type from a bundle of many. Ctrl-Mousewheel will switch modes, also Shift-Leftclick allows you to open the configuration interface even if you don't have access to that side of the conduit.

# Quest: Improving Conduits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAiA.name=§6§lImproving Conduits
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAiA.desc=Conduits on their own are pretty awesome, but you can do better. By using filters and speed upgrades, you gain even more control over what they do and how fast they work.%n%n§3PS: You can't make all of these right now.

# Quest: Making Things Pretty
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAiQ.name=§6§lMaking Things Pretty
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAiQ.desc=While conduits on their own are already awesome, you can also hide them if you want. There are 2 types of facades, basic and hardened. While basic ones are simple and easy, the reinforced ones are able to withstand explosions and mining with tools. You have to use your Yeta Wrench to remove it.%n%nYou'll have to paint your facades in the Painting Machine first - place the block you want them to look like where the paintbrush is, and the facade on the left. Of course, the Painting Machine needs to be powered.

# Quest: Come to the Dark Side...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAig.name=§5§6§lCome to the Dark Side...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAig.desc=...we have cookies.

# Quest: Brewing Liquids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjg.name=§6§lBrewing Liquids
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjg.desc=This machine is not only capable of brewing more powerful burnable liquids, it can also be used to brew nutrient distillation, which might have further usage soon™.%n%nNote that you get different ratios depending on what item you use for recipes that allow alternates. Use what you like.

# Quest: Smelting All-Joy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjw.name=§6§lSmelting All-Joy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjw.desc=This combination smelter allows you to produce fused quartz and quite clear glass of all variants.%n%nIt does §onot§r alloy you to make the EIO alloys though, you'll need a mixer and (probably) EBF for that.

# Quest: Ore Processing, Kind Of...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAkQ.name=§6§lOre Processing, Kind Of...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAkQ.desc=The endless war between macerators and SAG mills rages on eternally, so why does it matter which one you choose?%n%nHV Macerators are still required for the final byproducts on many ore chains, but a SAG mill still shines through with upgraded grinding heads! SAG mills are perfect machine for getting the most from your ores without using bees and crops. You can get bonus outputs with tungsten grinding heads, but that doesn't mean you can dupe materials (like ingots) with it. Plus for many of them you'll get the final output directly without any need for further processing.  Handy for processing Redstone to get Chrome!%n%nIt's great for lead, copper, tin, silver, nickel, redstone, ruby, lapis, certus quartz, and malachite ores. Other ores will give you better outputs as well if you use a good enough head.%n%nEven coal, charcoal, bones, wheat, ender pearls, and charcoal non-ores will give bonus outputs.%n%nThat said, the GT ones are still way faster later on.%n

# Quest: Tasty...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlA.name=§6§lTasty...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlA.desc=Yeah, that is... Well.. You are sure it will have a usage for something... some day... eventually... maybe...

# Quest: Fire Water
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlQ.name=§6§lFire Water
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlQ.desc=Too bad, you can't drink it. When used in the Combustion Generator, it will produce 80 RF/t.

# Quest: Hootch
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlg.name=§6§lHootch
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAlg.desc=The lowest tier of renewable, burnable fluid. Generates 60 RF/t, but can be automated for "green" infinite power.

# Quest: Simple Item Transfer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmQ.name=§6§lSimple Item Transfer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmQ.desc=Translocators can only transfer items over a distance of 1 block. But they're quite cheap, and a good solution to building compact machine setups. They include a free simple item filter which can be enabled on the input or output side. And they support multiple inputs and outputs! Glowstone will make it transfer faster - try investigating other upgrades.

# Quest: Simple Fluid Transfer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmg.name=§6§lSimple Fluid Transfer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmg.desc=Just like the item translocators, the fluid ones transfer... fluids. Same restrictions apply, 1 block distance. These can also be upgraded.

# Quest: A New Alloy, Soularium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAApg.name=§6§lA New Alloy, Soularium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAApg.desc=There are some... "Darker" uses for machines. Stuff that might be considered "magic". Anyway, for that you need a new alloy: Soularium.

# Quest: A Soul Vessel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAqA.name=§6§lA Soul Vessel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAqA.desc=The Soul Vial is used later in HV Ender IO machines. For now though you may find it convenient to deal with....troublesome mobs. The Soul Vial is reuseable. Just right-click any living entity to steal its soul. Right click again to release it in the environment.%n%nThe possibilities swirl in your head...

# Quest: Venting the Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAzg.name=§6§lVenting the Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAzg.desc=A low tech method to cool down the hot coolant is to use vent covers. Just place the cover on any GregTech block which can contain IC2 coolant and place water in front. The easiest might be just a tank or pipe. This will help until you have access to a Large Heat Exchanger or a Vacuum Freezer.%n%nAn advanced or overclocked reactor vent is much faster than a basic heat vent but you can't make those yet. Those covers also work with a air in front, but the basic heat vent needs a water block in front. Obviously, all vent covers are faster with water in front than with just air.

# Quest: Diesel Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKQ.name=§6§lDiesel Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKQ.desc=If you get an MV mixer, you can mix your light and heavy fuel together to give diesel. At 480,000 per cell, this turns 1,525,000 EU into 2,880,000, not accounting for how much you spent to get it, so it's definitely worth it.

# Quest: RF Batteries
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACXA.name=§6§lRF Batteries
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACXA.desc=Basic Capacitor Banks are RF batteries which can store the RF power you generate. You can put many blocks together to enlarge your total battery capacity - they will merge into one battery.%n%nYou can also change the mode of each face using your wire cutters or yeta wrench instead of the GUI. One option is a nice display of input and output RF, but it has to be taller than it is wide.%n%nThese are great for interfacing with RF machines. GT wires will convert to RF, but they send a full amp packet no matter what. EnderIO machines properly accept it, but others like Genetics do not and waste most of the packet, so consider using them with any RF machine if it looks like you need it.

# Quest: Bio Fuels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC2g.name=§6§lBio Fuels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC2g.desc=You've been using steam, creosote, and possibly oil plus their byproducts to generate power. It's time to start making bio diesel. The first step is to make plant balls out of organic materials. You can use wheat, sugarcane, apples, saplings or, well, practially anything. Indigo blossoms are 4:1 and unlike the rest of the IC2 crops with the same ratio, not really useful for anything else. Realistically, you'll probably just use saplings though, since you'll want/need a tree farm anyway.%n%nBe sure you have a Forestry multifarm, Steve's Carts Farm, IC2 Crop Sticks with a harvester, or whatever, because you need plenty of biomaterials for constant bio diesel production.

# Quest: Plantballs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC2w.name=§6§lPlantballs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC2w.desc=Next you should compress plantballs out of your wheat.%n%nThe MV compressor is twice as fast as the LV. You might think this means using it is a good idea. You would be §4WRONG§r. Why? Remember it also uses 4x the power. This means you spend 4x the EU to get the same amount of EU, twice as fast. Eventually, you end up with an EU deficit with this kind of setup, though not necessarily this setup. Ironic, I know. You can use multiple machines (like, a lot), and later use a Processing Array or multiblock if there is one. This applies to all fuel production, basically.

# Quest: Plant Mass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3A.name=§6§lPlant Mass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3A.desc=Macerate the plantballs down to plant mass for better processing. The HV macerator has an extra slot so you can get more, but it's not worth it power-wise, same for EV and IV.

# Quest: Bio Chaff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3Q.name=§6§lBio Chaff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3Q.desc=Plant mass needs to be centrifuged into bio chaff, the base material to make biomass.

# Quest: Way One: IC2 Fluid Canner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3g.name=§6§lWay One: IC2 Fluid Canner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3g.desc=The first way you get biomass out of bio chaff is to use the IC2 Fluid Canner. One bucket of water and one bio chaff gives one bucket of biomass.%n%n§4This option is not really recommended. You should focus on GT machines, not IC2. It also has some buggy interaction with normal cells, you might need to use universal cells.

# Quest: Way Two: Brewery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3w.name=§6§lWay Two: Brewery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC3w.desc=If you are lucky and find some brewing stands or have started using Thaumcraft to make one, you can craft a brewery. You get 1000mb of biomass out of 1000mb water and 1 bio chaff. Use Distilled water to get a better ratio and a much faster recipe.

# Quest: Fermented Biomass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC4A.name=§6§lFermented Biomass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC4A.desc=Fermenting your biomass allows you to to get more products out of it like methanol, ethanol, ammonia, etc.

# Quest: Extrude All the Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5A.name=§6§lExtrude All the Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC5A.desc=Now that you've hit MV tier, it's time to get a better ratio when making rods, pipes, wires, plates and many more parts. Most extruder recipes use more than 32 EU/t so you need an MV extruder. After crafting the machine you need extruder shapes for the different types of parts you will want to make.%n%nThere are a few more shapes than the ones listed here. Make sure to have a look.%n%n§3Most of the Tinkers Gregworks tool parts are made in the extruder. They also have long extrusion times to balance out their usefulness.

# Quest: Solar Grade Ingots
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6g.name=§6§lSolar Grade Ingots
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC6g.desc=To turn your solar grade dust into solar grade ingots you need to use an EBF with kanthal coils and then cool the resulting hot ingots in a chemical bath.

# Quest: Are You Prepared For HV?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC7Q.name=§6§lAre You Prepared For HV?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC7Q.desc=Stainless steel will be the tier material for HV. Use a MV mixer to produce the dust.%n%nManganese can be acquired as ore byproducts from spessartine, pyrolusite and tantalite ore. You can also pull them apart to get even more. Alternatively you can take apart Red Garnet dusts. If you get desperate, you can buy some ore from the Coins tab.%n%nChrome can be centrifuged out of ruby dust. You can get ruby dust from redstone if the ruby in redstone veins isn't enough.

# Quest: Molten Plastic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC7g.name=§6§lMolten Plastic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC7g.desc=Molten polyethylene can be made in a chemical reactor using ethylene, compressed air cells or oxygen - using oxygen gives a 50%% boost. Use a mold for making plates in a fluid solidifier to make plastic sheets.

# Quest: Mixing at MV level
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC7w.name=§6§lMixing at MV level
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC7w.desc=MV Mixer is needed to progress toward HV. It also unlocks Diesel, more efficient fuel.

# Quest: Silicon Plate
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC8A.name=§6§lSilicon Plate
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC8A.desc=Advanced circuits require transistors, which are made out of high grade silicon plates, fine tin wire and molten polyethylene.

# Quest: Stainless Steel EBF processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC8Q.name=§6§lStainless Steel EBF processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC8Q.desc=Stainless Steel ingots are made in the Electric Blast Furnace at a temperature of 1700K.%n%nIt takes 85 seconds at 480 EU/t or 60 seconds at 480 EU/t by adding Oxygen gas. Always add a gas if you can, you're saving tons of power by doing so, and you're gonna need a TON of SS. The Cracker, Large Steam Turbine, and Distillery Tower all need huge amounts of SS. A single DT uses several stacks, and you're gonna want more than just one.

# Quest: MV Energy Hatch
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC8g.name=§6§lMV Energy Hatch
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC8g.desc=Some materials like stainless steel require 480 EU/t. Your LV hatches are not good enough. Craft a minimum of two MV hatches to upgrade your electric blast furnace to HV.%n%n§3BTW, if a MB recipe is 1EU over 1A for that tier, you §omust§r §3use a second energy hatch for it to use 2A or more.

# Quest: Ruby Electrolyzing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC9Q.name=§6§f§6§lRuby Electrolyzing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC9Q.desc=Ruby is a good source for chrome and a little alumina. Once you get low on Ruby, you can centrifuge Redstone to get more.%n%nAnother good source of alumina and oxygen is red granite dusts. You can get those from red stonelillies. Check out the Fishing Farming Cooking tab for more details about IC2 crops.

# Quest: Molten Polyethylene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC9w.name=§6§lMolten Polyethylene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC9w.desc=Polyethylene is made out of ethylene and oxygen in a chemical reactor. Molten Polyethylene cells hold 144L, perfect for 1 ingot or plate. %nIf you want precise amounts, you can use a Volumetric Flask once you electrolyze some Boron from Borax.%n%nYou §omay§r have started getting damaged from holding the cells. If you have, put your glove baubles back on. All Molten cells cause damage and store 144L. Mostly, Molten cells come from metal-type materials, or stuff that was melted. Excuse me, §oFluid Extracted§r, whatever that's supposed to mean.%n%nNotice some leftovers? Try using the plunger, or if you have the materials, you can use 12 ethylene cells and 84 oxygen cells to make exactly 125 cells of polyethylene.

# Quest: Clay Electrolyzing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-A.name=§6§lClay Electrolyzing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-A.desc=If you looked through NEI you may have found out that electrolyzing clay dust will give you Alumina, Silicon Dioxide, Sodium, and Lithium dust. And water, but you're probably just voiding that already, right? There's plenty of stained clay blocks found in canyon, mesa, lush desert biomes or several to a couple dozen on mountains that can be pulverized to clay dust.%n%nThere's more ways to get alumina now that you're in MV, enough that it's basically worthless by the time you get to EV.

# Quest: Raw Carbon Mesh
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBQ.name=§6§lRaw Carbon Mesh
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBQ.desc=This way of making carbon plates requires autoclaving carbon dust. There are 4 different fluids you can use, check NEI to see which gives how much.

# Quest: Bio Organic Mesh
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBg.name=§6§lBio Organic Mesh
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBg.desc=If you want to save the environment you can autoclave 16 plantballs to get raw bio fiber with the following liquids:%n%nBiomass        33%% chance%nMethanol       50%% chance%nFuel            90%% chance%nNitro-diesel 100%% chance%n%n§rHowever, making carbon plates this way will require an electric blast furnace.

# Quest: Carbon Plates
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADCg.name=§7§6§lCarbon Plates
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADCg.desc=Carbon plates are used for a bunch of stuff, including eventually the nanosuit. Go check out the armor chapter.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDA.name=§6§lOrganic Way
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDA.desc=Bio carbon plates are made out of raw carbon mesh. Put it in the electric blast furnace to make carbon plates.

# Quest: Monocrystalline Silicon Boules
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDg.name=§6§lMonocrystalline Silicon Boules
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDg.desc=To make wafers, you need to make monocrystalline silicon boules first. The process takes 450 seconds and requires solar grade silicon dust and a small gallium arsenide crystal in the electric blast furnace. You can make 16 wafers out of every boule.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADtw.desc=Use molds to make plates, sticks, bolts and many more item parts in the fluid solidifier.%n%nMolds are != to Extruder shapes. You're gonna need 2 sets. If they're too expensive, just make the most important ones for now.

# Quest: Dark Steel Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADuQ.name=§5§6§lDark Steel Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADuQ.desc=Dark steel pipes are much better than the bronze, steel, or potin pipes you might have been using. Make sure your wrench can handle mining level 3 or you can't deconstruct them.%n%n§3If you don't need these, just recycle them to get the materials back. Not everything needs ginormous pipes or high heat tolerance.

# Quest: Empty Plastic Board
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD9w.name=§6§lEmpty Plastic Board
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD9w.desc=Plastic circuit boards require a plastic plate with Sulfuric Acid to make an Empty Board.

Unforunately, it's in the nether...at the bottom of the lava ocean! %n%nHere are some tips for finding it:%n%n-Firestone only spawns in deep lava, at least 6 deep. It will only replace netherrack, so a fjord filled with soulsand won't have any. Can you think of ways to check the lava depth, and what's down there?%n-Alternatively, if you keep your head at just the correct height above the lava and at the correct angle, you'll be able to see underneath it - surely there must be a hovering jetpack?%n-...or just look for the biome when your cursor is over the JM map. Hell is the default one that has netherrack.%n%nFirestone can be mined with the GT miners, if you place it within horizontal range. Firestone ore and products will cause random fires to start nearby, so get it into a backpack quickly!

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF1g.desc=Time for a second EBF! %n%nYou can make ingots faster in 3 ways - better coils, higher tier energy hatches, or adding more furnaces. It's probably time to add a second EBF to your base.%n%nMultiblock machines can share casings, mufflers, and input/output hatches/busses, but not maintenance hatches (you can share the auto ones though). You can share energy hatches, but only if you can supply enough power to all machines it's a part of. So if you have two EBFs that both want MV power, and you use a MV Energy Hatch, it won't work, since neither will get enough power. This is almost never used, so don't worry about it. Also, if you want to share inputs on Processing Arrays, turn off recipe map filtering on the busses.%n%nRemember, pollution will be very high with two EBFs active at once! Watch out for high pollution effects. Use the best mufflers available and don't place the EBFs in the same chunk as farmland or other high pollution machines like Pyrolyse Ovens and Large Boilers.%n%nYou can use whatever coils you have lying around, but you might want to start searching for Mica if you haven't found any yet.

# Quest: Speeding Up Slow Machines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIPg.name=§6§lSpeeding Up Slow Machines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIPg.desc=Many mods don't have methods of speeding up their slow machines. For this, you'll need a GregTech World Accelerator. It guzzles amps though, so your power infrastructure better be ready for it. The tooltip will list the performance boost provided. For block-based acceleration, the WA will do an area around it. For TileEntities like most machines, it will only accelerate the blocks directly touching the WA, and will need to be reconfigured with a screwdriver. This uses twice the power though.%n%n§4This does not work with GregTech machines!§r For those, build more or higher tier ones.%n%nIf you want, you can change the level of acceleration by using a wrench on it. It will go back to the minimum, then increase one tier from there for every usage. It will use that tier's amount of power (and acceleration), increasing as per GT standard of 2x speed (acceleration) and 4x EU per tier.

# Quest: Welcome to the Church of Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIXQ.name=§6§lWelcome to the Church of Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIXQ.desc=If you made it to MV using steam, you're probably wondering how to survive going further. One option is to switch to Light Fuel, discussed in LV. Another option is to use Benzene. Benzene is made from Wood Tar. There are a couple of pathways for that. Both start with logs from trees.  %n%nOne path is to use Coke Ovens or Advanced Coke Ovens to make charcoal, and fluid-extract Wood Tar from it (use LV fluid extractors for maximum EU efficiency). Then distill the Wood Tar to make Benzene. This method produces less pollution, but will also provide less Benzene.%n%nThe second path is to use the Pyrolyze Oven multiblock and Nitrogen gas to extract Wood Tar and Charcoal. Fluid Extract the Charcoal for addtional Wood Tar. Then proceed as above. This method will create pollution from the Pyrolyze, but will provide more Benzene per log.%n%nExcess wood tar can also be turned into Toluene, a key ingredient for explosives that you'll need later on to make rockets.%n%nIf you use the Charcoal Byproducts recipe, you can get a plethora of useful byproducts as well, but you'll need 4 DTs.

First, you need to use some Sulfuric Acid to melt off any impurities in a Chemical Bath, leaving you with Crushed Rare Earth (I). After that you need to process it like a normal ore until you get Rare Earth (I) Dust.%n%nAfter running the Dust through your Dehydrator, you get a number of strange materials, only some of which you recognize. But if you run these materials through an Electrolyzer or through the Dehydrator again, you may get some use out of them. Some of them may take quite a few to do so, but you §o§o§r§h§ohave§r been stockpiling, right? You'll need 204 Rare Earth.%n%nYou believe if you had more powerful acids and machines, you could extract even more valuable materials out of the Rare Earth.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHVQ.desc=Now you can actually make the UUM with a Mass Fabricator. Well, technically you could make it without UUA, but that's way more expensive. To make sure it only runs with UUA, put a programmed circuit (any value) in the machine's slot. UUMatter can be used for some very specific things, such as replicating §osome§r materials (check NEI, mostly/all periodic table), used with crops to create an ore, some specific high-level recipes need it, and...you can also sit in it to get regen.%n%nThe energy usage and overclocking of the Mass Fabricator is different than the usual GT way. To have fixed EU to UUM ratios for all tiers, the machine does perfect 2/2 overclocks. It also start with a very high amperage in LV. The following chart should make it more clear:%n%nTier  Amps       EU/t         Time%nLV     8A         256          160%nMV     4A         512           80%nHV     2A        1024           40%nEV     1A        2048           20%nIV     0.5A      4096           10%netc.%n%nPut in power (and hopefully UUA), and out comes UUM.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI9w.desc=Efficient Platinum processing is quite complicated. But for now, we can just smelt it directly into nuggets. This might not be the most efficient route to take, but it is enough for what we want to do next.%n%nAt this tier, your best source of Platinum is Nickel ores from the Twilight Forest, or maybe Endstone Dust if you've managed to survive the End already.

# Quest: Hidden Drawers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJXg.name=§9§lHidden Drawers

# Quest: Controlling Your Drawers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJaA.name=§9§lControlling Your Drawers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJaA.desc=Now that you have MV Circuits and Stainless Steel, you can make the incredibly handy Drawer Controller. This block will make any drawers it connects to in a 4-block radius (including the y-axis) and 50 blocks at maximum as part of a multiblock that allows storage (and retrieval with the right setup) to any of the blocks that make it up. This will allow you to dump the contents of your mining trip into a storage system much easier. Just hold right click on the Controller front for a second or two, and any items that match what's already in the multiblock will be deposited, while your tools and such won't. Just make sure to place your Controller last so it registers all the drawers.%n%nYou can feed into the Controller (and thus the rest of the drawers) with any kind of piping or hopper equivalent. If using it as part of a Multifarm or Mob Farm, make sure to set the contents of the drawers, and lock them with a key so that it properly stores everything in an organized manner. If the drawers' contents aren't set, it will start filling starting from the ones closest. If you wish to have more than one drawer full of an item, put a void upgrade on the drawer further from the Controller, and it will fill the first one, then the second.%n%nIf you want to go around corners, use the Trim Drawers to extend the multiblock. If you want to have a second point to dump items into, use the Controller Slave (one per multiblock, automation only). Note that you can use a key on the Controller to affect all drawers at once.%n%nOnce you have an ME Network, place a storage bus on the Controller, and the entire inventory will be accessible from the network, with both storage and retrieval. Just remember to set the priority higher than your ME Drives. If you haven't locked them yet expect all your drawers to fill with random items from your ME Network.%n%n§4Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will tank TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.%n%nAdditionally, expect all non-backpack interactions to be DISABLED on the official servers. Congratulations, Drawer Cubists, you ruined it for everyone.

# Quest: Power of the Sun from Nuclear
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAg.name=§a§lPower of the Sun from Nuclear
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAg.desc=Your good old singleblock Molecular Transformer is gone. So how to obtain Sunnarium? Well there are couple of ways, but at EV you'll need to radiate Glowstone and convert to Sunnarium.%n%nThe Glowstone rod will slowly charge up if you put it next to any fuel rod in your IC2 reactor. The exact charging speed is `(number of rods adjacent) * (floor(hull temperature/3000) + 1)` per second. A dual rod will count as 2 rods and quad fuel rod will count as 4 rods for this purpose. The Glowstone rod will neither emit heat, nor cause other component to emit more heat. You can treat this rod as a reactor plating in the IC2 Reactor Planner.%n%nAs you can see, the speed is directly proportional to hull temperature and rods adjacent. At the very extreme you can fully charge up a Glowstone rod in less than half a minute and output one Sunnarium every 10 second (on average, since cells aren't charged at same speed due to different position), but that require very considerable resource to setup. It also involves a vacuum freezer to cooldown the coolant cells and running the reactor at 66000+ hull temperature. Balance your need and your resource situation wisely. In any case, if you just wish to charge it up FAST then here is a possible string for the IC2 Reactor Planner:%n%nerp=bpO50cpsdtJElVqn4hObFJc0tiOE0JpEHYpqTxJHvyezjSKRjUuwgouXzNOlU4a3hFBRygM=%n%nReplace Containment Reactor Plating with actual Glowstone rods and you should be good to go.

betterquesting.quest.nNTmwkdsQgyE6QAfmIwcvg.desc=So you were looking at Thorium 232 and wondering how to make it?%n%nYou could centrifuge it at a horrible chance rate with a long recipe but there are better ways of obtaining it.%n%nThe better ways are processing chains that can be made in three different paths with the third path being unlocked at a further stage after obtaining Fusion with the Neutron Activator.%n%nThe first path requires the chemical plant multiblock that you might not be familiar with but will become required to create rocket fuel for any tier three or higher rocket. This path is the fastest with only two steps to obtain the Thorium 232, but requires borax which can only be obtained (for now) through mining salt veins as a byproduct or through bees (probably the better option if you already have some).%n%nThe second path is a six step processing chain that requires Chemical Reactors, a Centrifuge, and an EBF. Even though it is longer it offers much better conversion ratio (75%% instead of 25%% in chemical plant), instead of borax it requires nitric acid (4000L per dust if you account for recycling) and 100L of fluorine per dust.%n%nEither way I would recommend using AE2FC as it allows on demand fluid crafting which will assist in both processing chains.%n

A lot of the materials here won't be good sources in any way, but they're literally better than nothing.%n%nMonazite Sulfate isn't an actual compound btw, just a term for a collection of rare earth sulfates and other things.%n%nI'll only ask for the primary output as who wants to worry about chances?

# Quest: Hafnium Line
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL5w.name=§b§lHafnium Line
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL5w.desc=There is a key difference with hafnium here, however. Follow this miniline to hear more.%n%nFirst off you'll need to react your hafnia with some hydrochloric acid.%n%nAnd, like with zirconium, you'll need the solution rather than the dust.

# Quest: Zirconium Line
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL6A.name=§b§lZirconium Line
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL6A.desc=To get started, react your zirconia with some hydrochloric acid.%n%nThe dust on its own is kinda useless, though... Make it into a solution instead.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL6w.name=§b§lWe Ain't Running a Farm!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL6w.desc=...What's this low-purity hafnium stuff?%n%nWell, because you of course want your hafnium to be of the highest quality, you're going to have to do a little more than just EBF it with a little magnesium.%n%nGo ahead and react it with some Iodine. If you're not too sure where to get Iodine, have a look at Seaweed Ash. (hint: you'll need to look at small piles)%n%nNote that both the liquid and dust forms of iodine are optional, so you can complete the quest with one. Or none!%n%n

# Quest: Finally, Actual Hafnium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL7A.name=§b§lFinally, Actual Hafnium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL7A.desc=Now that wasn't so hard, was it? %n%nHafnium is used as a component in making the Sparge tower which is useful if you ventured into the Liquid Fluorine Thorium Fluid Nuclear reactor.%n%nYou also get half of your Iodine back with this. Also, keep the runoff. It might become useful later, especially if stuff's suggested §owink wink nudge nudge§r

# Quest: Dilution, Yet Again
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL7Q.name=§b§lDilution, Yet Again
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL7Q.desc=Those sulfates aren't going to dilute themselves!%n%nYou get more fluid per piece of monazite, what's not to like?

# Quest: Now for Nitration
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL7g.name=§b§lNow for Nitration
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL7g.desc=For the next step you'll need ammonium nitrate (again with the nitric acid!) and your diluted monazite sulfate.%nYou'll need to do this in an LCR.%n%nThe resulting fluid simply vanishes into the void. Best not to worry about it.

# Quest: Chemically Bathing!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL8Q.name=§b§lChemically Bathing!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL8Q.desc=Yep, this really is an all-rounder line. Again you'll need some ammonium nitrate. Just another reminder for those who are yet to make a dedicated nitric acid setup :P

# Quest: Thorium and Phosphate
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL8g.name=§b§lThorium and Phosphate
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL8g.desc=Now you can thermal centrifuge the dust to get both thorium and phosphate out. Told you the yields weren't great...

# Quest: To Sift, or Not to Sift?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL8w.name=§b§lTo Sift, or Not to Sift?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL8w.desc=The real question is, who came up with all these sifting recipes?%n%nYou can get some Uranium out of this so it's not all bad.

# Quest: Uranium Filtrate

# Quest: Uranium?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL9Q.name=§b§lUranium?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL9Q.desc=§o§r...And sift it to get the uranium. You §odo§o§r get some 235 out of it so time not entirely wasted, hopefully?

# Quest: Dry It Real Good
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL9g.name=§b§lDry It Real Good
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL9g.desc=Your concentrate is far too damp! You'll need to dry it off in the EBF.%n%nThankfully the recipe is far from difficult.

# Quest: Nitration Time... Again
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL9w.name=§b§lNitration Time... Again
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL9w.desc=You'll need to add even more nitric acid to be able to deal with the dust further. 

# Quest: Leach The Concentrate
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL-A.name=§b§lLeach The Concentrate
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL-A.desc=Here you have two options: Either you can mix some water with your nitrated mixture for relatively low yield, or you can mix it with the cerium-containing mixture you get from ores for double the amount.

# Quest: Compounding With Oxalate
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL-w.name=§b§lCompounding With Oxalate
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL-w.desc=Combining your cerium chloride with oxalate yields you cerium oxalate. This can then be heated (in your EBF(s), of course) to get §oanother §rcerium oxide.

# Quest: Oxalate
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL_A.name=§b§lOxalate
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL_A.desc=Oxalate is really only useful for cerium processing. Go ahead and make a bit.%n%nThere are a couple options for this so just look through NEI and pick whichever is most suitable for you.

# Quest: Glowing Matter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBA.name=§b§lGlowing Matter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBA.desc=Another way to get Sunnarium! Just throw stacks of Glowing Coral and a tiny bit of UU-Matter in an autoclave and hope for the best.%n%nYou can either use an IC2 crop farm, or have any type of Glowstone farm and combine it with a GT++ Algae Farm.%n%nA farm for Glowing Coral or Glowstone should also help you mass produce other resources like Gold, Redstone, Mercury, etc.%n%n%n§3The Large Processing Factory can speed things up, but is also rather expensive to make.

# Quest: You Can't Be Cerious!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBw.name=§b§lYou Can't Be Cerious!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBw.desc=Punny, right?%n%nYou now can electrolyze the cerium oxide to get pure elemental cerium dust.%n%nOh, and oxygen, but who cares about that anymore?%n%nThis handy material is useful in many different multiblock machines that will be unlocked in later tiers such as the Precise Assembler, the Elemental Duplicator and better casings to the Chemical Plant for a new tier of rocket fuel.

# Quest: Freezing Nitrates
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCA.name=§b§lFreezing Nitrates
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCA.desc=Yep, you're seeing right: A line with a vacuum freezer!%n%nTo separate some of the more... tricky elements, extreme cold is needed.

# Quest: Not Quite Ferromagnetic...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCQ.name=§b§lNot Quite Ferromagnetic...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCQ.desc=...But it's enough to separate with the magnetic separator.%n%nNow you can get both Europium III Oxide and some of the rarer rare earths.

# Quest: EuO
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCg.name=§b§lEuO

# Quest: The Other Way
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMDw.name=§b§lThe Other Way
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMDw.desc=When you inevitably get Samarium Ore, you'll end up getting a ton of this dust. There are a couple of options here: One includes the monazite line and has a higher yield, the other is simpler but has a poorer yield.%nWe'll look at the latter here.%n%nEventually you'll probably want to switch entirely to the monazite option, but for now, supplementing it with this can be a good idea.

# Quest: Finally, Samarium!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEA.name=§b§lFinally, Samarium!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEA.desc=(And Gadolinium)%n%nEasy, right? Not to worry, there's always the bastnasite line to stay your hunger for complex lines!%n%nSamarium can be used to fuel your ever growing Magnetic Samarium Rods needs from LuV up to UHV while Gadolinium is used in the far lategame in the making of powerfull Compact Fusion reactors.

# Quest: Intradimensional Input buses
betterquesting.quest.VCXYSn_PTZ6kY3d6kFTFwg.name=Intradimensional Input buses
betterquesting.quest.VCXYSn_PTZ6kY3d6kFTFwg.desc=This Special bus is rather pricey however it will allow all items that are in the bus to be accessible in all other linked buses in the same dimension. %n%nThis would allow multiple machines to work from the same input of items. %n%nWhile holding a data stick the configuration settings can be copied with a left click and pasted with a right click on the bus.%n

# Quest: Wait are you sure?
betterquesting.quest.fvz-5lJaRAqfsM1hcAYOng.name=Wait are you sure?
betterquesting.quest.fvz-5lJaRAqfsM1hcAYOng.desc=So for some reason you have decided to pick the EBF option.%n%nWell get ready for a processing line.%n%nFirst you need to react Thorium Dust with Hydrofluoric Acid and eight buckets of Nitric Acid. I hope you have a Nitric Acid setup.%n%nThen react the Thorium Nitrate with Sodium Hydroxide to produce Thorium Hydroxide. Then react with even more Hydrofluoric Acid to get Thorium Tetrafluoride.%n%nThen pump it into a Centrifuge to separate the normal Thorium away from the Thorium 232. Sadly it is still in a liquid form so you will need to blast it with Zinc Chloride and Calcium.%n%nThen finally use your Blast Furnace again for the Zn-Th alloy ingot to separate the Zinc from the Thorium 232 to obtain the Thorium 232 Dust and even get your Zinc back in fluid form.%n%nWell I hope you enjoyed the processing line for Thorium 232 EBF edition.%n


## Quest Line: Tier 6 - LuV
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA.name=Tier 6 - LuV
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA.desc=If you have made it this far, you should walk with your head held high - you are at the start of the lategame.

Congrats, and be proud of yourself.%n%nOnce you're done being proud, start making CALs for better circuits, and work towards making endgame power with the Fusion Reactor, you'll need it.

# Quest: Automated Mining
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyQ.name=§c§lAutomated Mining
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyQ.desc=The QED enables you to assemble the most convenient device for mining: The ender quarry.%n%nAs 0lafe says, "This small black box is life-changing" and "Sympathy for the amount of dense obsidian plates you need."%n%nGuess you better get compressing!%n%n§4NOTE: It's best to place your quarry and markers on orevein boundaries.

# Quest: Accelerating Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyg.name=§c§lAccelerating Things
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyg.desc=If an ender quarry won't satisfy your needs for MOOORE. A speed upgrade is required.

# Quest: Starting Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEvA.name=§l§c§lStarting Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEvA.desc=Now that your power needs are increasing, you need a way to keep up with demand. To generate over 1A ZPM with a single machine you have two options: solars, and fusion.%n%nWhile solars are simpler to set up, solars cap out at 524288 EU/t. Fusion can reach levels close to eight times that with the right setup. %n%nFor your first reactor, you will need a controller, 2-16 fluid input hatches, 1-16 fluid output hatches, and 16 energy hatches. All hatches have to be LuV tier or better. Each hatch provides 2048 EU/t for the recipe, and has a storage capacity of 10M eu. %n%nThis means you can do any fusion recipe that takes less than 32768 EU/t or less, and has a startup cost of 160M EU or less. Using more fluid hatches means you need less fusion casings. While this doesn't matter as much for the mk1 reactor, this principle helps tremendously with the higher reactor tiers. 

# Quest: Getting Europium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEvQ.name=§b§9§d§l§b§c§lGetting Europium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEvQ.desc=To make a mk2 reactor, ender quarry, T5 rocket, unlock ZPM, or other things, you will need europium.

The ores are: Chrome, Deep Iron, Iridium, Gold, Magnetite, Nickel, Osmium, Silicon, Shadowiron, Tungsten, and Vanadium.%n%nYou can get Neutronium from small ores on Enceladus, Oberon, and Titan.%n%nAnd grab some planet blocks while you're at it too.%n%nYou can get the schematic for T6 on Enceladus.%n%n§3I'm sure you can tell by now, but it's not like every planet is required, so go to the ones you want to, and skip the ones you don't want to go to. Use NEI to figure out where you NEED to go.

# Quest: Magneto Resonatic Circuits

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKag.desc=So, you may have been looking through NEI and seen a line of purple circuits from BW and wondered 'What are these, and when can I make them?'. Well, I don't know why they exist, but you can make them starting now!%n%nThey all use Imprint Supporting Boards, a type of crystal (change the dust to crystal with Neon or Krypton in an Autoclave, and then move up tiers with the Precision Laser Engraver), SMDs (or and advanced version), and a §3circuit of the previous tier.§r So the material cost increases rather dramatically. They're made at a power tier +1 of the circuit's tier, so IV ones are made with LuV voltage.%n%nYou can even make UEV circuits if you're crazy enough!

# Quest: Mutating Things is Cool
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKeA.name=§c§lMutating Things is Cool
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKeA.desc=When making Raw Crystal Chips, you have two other options if using Europium constantly is too expensive for you: Bacterial Sludge, and Mutagen.%n%nMutagen is obviously better than the sludge, but how do you get it? I'll teach you how.%n%nFirst, get the Bacterial Sludge you got from Mars, and run it through a Brewery along with some U-238 to get EnrichedBacterialSludge. Then Ferment it to get FermentedBacterialSludge. And finally you Distill it to get Mutagen.%n%nBut is a single bucket enough for you? Hardly! But now that we have some, we can make more with the vat. Use the Mutagen you got along with some of that Mysterious Crystal Dust to make a culture. Unfortunately the chances are pretty low, so you'll almost certainly have to do it several times.%n%nOnce you have your culture you can use it in the vat along with some of the dust again to make more. You'll need LuV-tier glass, and Plutonium rods.%n%nIf you want to get more Bacterial Sudge more easily, you can use the vat to make that too! The culture is much easier to make.%n%n§3Mutagen is also used for Gendustry, so if you want to do that, make a bunch.

# Quest: Data Bank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKbw.name=Data Bank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKbw.desc=By now you probably feel overwhelmed with the number of data sticks needed for your assembly line. TecTech has a solution for you: The Data Bank. It allows you to store more than just 16 data sticks and can be connected to multiple Assembling Lines at the same time.%n%nPlace the controller one block above the ground and use the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector to see how it is built. You will need a Maintenance Hatch and at least an EV Energy Hatch, though the power requirements can be much higher if you use many Data Access Hatches and Data Bank Master Connectors, so you might as well go for an LuV energy hatch, which will power a maxed one. Trying to run the Data Bank and then scanning the controller will tell you how much eu/t is needed.%n%n§rYou will need more blocks then what is asked for in this quest, as the number of Data Access Hatches and Connectors is up to you. You can have a maximum of 15 combined.%n%nThe Assembly Line Slave Connector replaces your old Data Access Hatch on the Assembling Line. Connect it to a Master Connector on the Data Bank with Optical Fiber Cable and make sure to color the hatches and the cable.%n%n§3If you can't figure out what blocks to place, pay attention to the tooltip in the bottom-left when using the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector.

# Quest: TecTech Multiblocks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKeg.name=TecTech Multiblocks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKeg.desc=TecTech Multiblock Common Functionality%n%nMultiple Ampere and Laser Hatches Compatibility - to ease power distribution.%n%nPower Pass - Allows connected dynamo hatches to take power from the controller and output it, just like the active transformer does (and that is why the controller always need it in it's recipe if that function is enabled...). §4Be sure to turn off Power Pass if you want to edit your machine and don't want it to explode!§r%n%nSafe Void - Enabling this moves all EM (Elemental Matter, not all machines use this) from input and output hatches to overflow hatches. Which allows the machine to be disassembled more easily.%n%nConstructable Interface - Allows visualizing the structure with blueprints (there is an API to implement that for any block, but almost nothing does).%n%nFrom left to right is 1, then clockwise for the rest in TT multi interfaces.%n%n1) Parameters - They are the way of the controller to communicate with player and parameter hatches. Lights indicate status but more detailed information can be seen when moused over. The tooltip contains ID in form of HatchID:ParameterNumber:Direction, Current Status, Current Value, and Short Description.%n%n2) Uncertainty status - These 9 blocks indicate uncertainty status of the machine. If the lights are on, this machine requires an uncertainty resolver. Red = Bad, Green = Good. You need to do the absurd puzzle before using the machine.%n%nControl buttons - Buttons might change their behavior and appearance depending on machine but usually they work like this, starting from top:%n%n3) Power Pass - Toggles Power Pass.%n%n4) Safe Void - Toggles Safe Void.%n%n5) Power Switch - Soft Mallet with your finger...%n%n6) Input slot - Standard functionality.%n

# Quest: Configuring TecTech Multiblocks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKew.name=Configuring TecTech Multiblocks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKew.desc=Many TecTech multis can be customized by adjusting certain internal numbers called parameters. You no longer need a separate block to do so, you can now directly adjust them in the GUI.%n%nIf there are lit up sections in the parameters part of the multi interface (see the TecTech Multiblocks quest), you can configure the multi, otherwise there is nothing to do.%n%nWe'll be using the Quantum Computer as our example, since that is what you probably want it for.%n%nFirst we need to understand the parameter naming, like ID:0:1:I. The first number represents the parameter block. For the QC only block 0 is used. Each such block can have up to 4 used parameters, 2 inputs and 2 outputs. The letter at the end specifies if a parameter is an input or output with I or O and the number in the middle distinguishes the 2 parameters of this kind in the block. It is either 0 or 1.%n%nInputs are something that is either set or is a default. Outputs give information that the machine sends to you, that indicates things. (like heat or Computation)%n%nAnd lastly. the Parametrizer Memory Card let's you copy settings from one machine to another easily.

# Quest: Lasers Solve Everything
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKqg.name=Lasers Solve Everything
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKqg.desc=Laser hatches are a high-end way of sending lots of amps of power, so much in fact, that it starts at 32A. This goes 32/64/96/128/256+ and continues from there. They're also so powerful that only a few machines support them outside of the ever §owonderful§r TecTech: LSC, MEBF, MVF. and PSS. (Might be added in the future!) Remember to color both the Laser Vacuum Pipes, and the Source and Target Hatches. Also, Source = Output, Target = Input.%n%nLaser Converters are basically: Laser Source (on machine) -> Vacuum Pipes -> LC -> 5x output split into X amps, 32 for the first. Make sure to put it into recieve mode. Or do it the other way around if you want to go up, it's basically a transformer that converts laser to/from cables. You can also use them to turn the lasers if you don't mind 3x the loss on device output (and not sending all the amps) compared to the Active Transformer (because of loss on each output). Just remember to put a battery buffer in between if you want it to work.%n%n§3You can use the Low Power Laser Pipes if using a 'Low Power' Hatch or Converter, but keep in mind you'll need to connect them with wire cutters yourself after coloring them.%n%n§cBe careful with using very high ampere hatches as every Laser Hatch has 1EU/s per max. ampere passive power loss.

# Quest: Enriched Naquadah Ingot
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALZw.name=Enriched Naquadah Ingot
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALZw.desc=Ah, you made it.%n%nYou can choose to smelt it with zinc in an EBF or electrolyze it. Either is fine but you can fully recycle the zinc, so the EBF recipe is better if you want the ingot.

# Quest: Enriched Naquadah Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALaA.name=Enriched Naquadah Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALaA.desc=The enriched naquadah line is much shorter than the naquadah line, and easier. It's used for fuel or Neuro Processing Units which are UV content, so if you don't want to build a line for it, just ignore these quests.

# Quest: Disproportionation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALiQ.name=Disproportionation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALiQ.desc=The chemical properties of naquadria are a bit weird.%n%nThere's nothing known that can precipitate it. The only way to get naquadria from the solution is to use high energy particle to bombard it.%n%nHowever, only a part of the output naquadria can be used for further processing and you have to re-purify the rest.

# Quest: Once again

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAErg.desc=A MK II is nice, but why not make a MK III? %n%nIt will double the power needed per recipe, while cutting the processing time in half. %n%nThis time you will need UV or above hatches, as well as the Fusion Machine Casing MK II. This reactor can handle recipes with up to 640M EU startup. Each energy hatch is capable of providing up to 32768eu/t per energy hatch for the recipe.

# Quest: I Put Fusion in Your Fusion so you Can Fusion While You Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsg.name=I Put Fusion in Your Fusion so you Can Fusion While You Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsg.desc=To make Oganesson, you'll need to make Californium. To make that, you'll need Beryllium and Plutonium 239, all in the Fusion Reactor. After the two fusion chains, you'll have the best noble gas in the pack, which is used in several places.%n%nIn this tier, you can send it to Void Miners, to increase their ore production speed, or EBFs, to make them run faster, although the EBF option is too weak right now (changes coming soon). Later on, Oganesson will be used in other places, like the optical circuit line, or to produce Metastable Oganesson, which is needed in much larger quantities later on.%n%nOganesson replication is on the way out, and the fusion recipe has improved a lot, so there is no longer an incentive to replicate and your Fusion Reactor should keep running for Og.

# Quest: Time for Another Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsw.name=Time for Another Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsw.desc=While one reactor is nice and all, why not make another? This time you can use the MK3 americium recipe to make it easier. %n%nCosting just 1 ingot of Plutonium, and 2 cells of hydrogen, this recipe is much easier and faster than the MK2 version. By making americium plasma, then putting it through a turbine, you will get americium in the liquid state. You will need at least 132 plates for the controller and the fusion machine casings.%n%nPlus, free power!

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMA.desc=You'll never §oever§r need to fix maintenance problems on any multi that has this, nor will it cost parts. Well, except to make it.

# Quest: Quantum Computer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH1w.name=Quantum Computer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH1w.desc=One of the most incredibly complicated machines, this will serve as the main structure for your Computation generation for the Research Station. %n%nFirst, you'll need a few things: the Quantum Computer itself, The Uncertainty Resolver, some good circuits and the Computer Racks to hold them, and at least a UV energy hatch (maybe start with a UV 4A energy hatch). The QC will consume 1A of UV, and each rack will use one more. So another important factor is to ONLY turn on the Quantum Computer once you have the desired recipe for the Research Station ready to avoid excess energy loss. Remember to turn the QC on BEFORE the RS. In order for you to build this absolute monster, you'll need to place down the Quantum Computer at least 1 block above the surface/ground and use the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector to see where to place everything. The blocks with no dots next to the vents indicate that that space must be empty. Later you'll want to build a bigger QC. Use a stack of multiple Hologram Projectors to see how that is build. If at some point even a maximum size QC with 24 racks is no longer sufficient, you can also chain multiple QCs. For now, let us focus on a basic setup.%n%nUncertainty Resolver:%nA mini-game that might take you a bit to understand. Your goal is to balance the lights around the focal points. Sometimes, the Schrödinger Status will require some puzzle solving again after a period of time. This is random and incredibly frustrating, especially during operations being done between the Research Station and Quantum Computer(s), so it is important to constantly check the Uncertainty Resolver before you start operations on your Computer. If the puzzle looks too hard or you can't complete it, just remove it and the controller and re-place them to get a different puzzle.%n%nComputer Racks:%nThe main component within the multiblock to generate Computation. In order to achieve this, you will need to input some circuits and ic2 heat vents; Advanced Heat Vents work best. It is critical that you use Heat Vents to prevent the heat from reaching a catastrophic point. Computer Racks will always melt or explode about 9000 heat (also written as 90 percent, 10000 being 100 percent) but most circuits have much lower thresholds. For our example here we will use Ultimate Crystalcomputers. With these, any heat above 54 percent should be avoided for safety reasons! The maximum heat will be different for different circuits, even if they are of the same tier. You can see the heat for individual racks by scanning them. You cannot remove or insert components until the heat is gone. You can see the overall heat value in the controller's interface. And most importantly: DO NOT WRENCH THE COMPUTER RACKS IF THEY HAVE HEAT IN THEM. Otherwise, you're going to get an explosion.%n%nComputation:%nComputation is generated every second and is based on the tier of your circuit. There are, however, differences in between how much computation is generated, even with the same exact tier. For instance, you could use a Master Quantum Computer (Quantum Circuit Series / LuV) or a Wetwareprocessor (Wetware Circuit Series / LuV) which will give you more Computation even though they are of the same tier. If you wish to find out exactly how much Computation a circuit gives; place down a Computer Rack, put a circuit inside and scan it. You can also see the total computation in the controller.%n%nIt will include the following information.%nBase computation: %nAfter overclocking: <same as above unless you specially overclock it>%nHeat Accumulated: <based on circuits and heat vents, keep a watchful eye on this part as it's extremely important>%n%nYou can find an overview of circuits with their maximum heat and Computation generation on the GTNH wiki.%n%nUsing the parameters in the GUI, you can overclock and overvolt the QC but we won't do so for our example setup here.%n%nSending Computation to the Research Station:%nUse the Optical Master Connector in one of the variable spaces on the QC, and the Optical Slave Connector on the RS. Use Optical Fiber Cable to connect them, and make sure to paint all three.%n%nExample setup:%nNow that you've understood the concepts and safety of handling of the QC, what are the more optimal setups for your Quantum Computer? For now, we suggest 2 racks with 3 Ultimate Crystalcomputers each, and of course 1 Advanced Heat Vent. This gives you 156 C/s and will get you started with recipes in the Research Station. This is a rather minimal setup though, you should probably think about more optimized (or just larger) setups later!%n%nNow that you understand the QC, it's time to build it! You'll need to gather quite a lot of resources.

# Quest: Research Station
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH2A.name=Research Station
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH2A.desc=Now that you've started building up your precious Quantum Computer, how about the Research Station? Once again, using the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector will tell you how to build this Multiblock. There should be 3 empty blocks beneath it so you can see the whole blueprint. Once it is nearly assembled, place down an Energy Hatch, an Optical Slave Connector, and a Maintenance Hatch all on the back side.%n%nOnce fully assembled, you can begin operating recipes at any time, so long as the Quantum Computer is also active and connected. The Research Station requires you to put the item to research within the Object Holder, then a data stick in the Multiblock interface. Once the Computation is fully completed, the data stick that houses all the data of the completed item will be inside the Multiblock Interface.%n%nStill confused? Good, that's the spirit of learning! Always make sure to test these things in creative single player if you wish to find exact measurements and such. Don't forget to ALWAYS COLOR THE OPTICAL HATCHES AND FIBERS!%n%n§3Note that some researches require a significant amount of amps, so keep that in mind.§r

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKWQ.desc=Turn your Raw Growth Medium into Sterilized Growth Medium in an IV Fluid Heater, and then you can use it in the Wetware Lifesupport Circuit Boards or the Neuro Processing Unit. But you'll also need to use it to make stemcells, so let's do that first.

# Quest: The Board that Keeps Life
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKWg.name=The Board that Keeps Life
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKWg.desc=To make Wetware Circuits, you'll need to make a Wetware Lifesupport Circuit Board. Making this board is quite a different process than making all the other Circuit Boards you've made, because making it actually requires materials!%n%nTo actually use it in circuits, you need to etch it.

# Quest: This is Not How You Make Cheese

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKWw.desc=In order to make Wetware circuits, you'll need Sterilized Growth Medium and Stemcells, so let's get started on those, ok?%n%nTo get anywhere, first you need Bacteria. You can get this through the vat or the brewing machine. Vat way is more efficient, but you need culture for it so you first need to do brewing way. Vat needs Bismuth rods for radiation and EV-tier glass. There are also 3 recipes, so you can use a higher tier one later if you like.%n%nYou'll also need Mince Meat and Agar. You'll want a stable supply of meat, so something like the a fish farm, a standard animal farm, or IC2 Meatrose or Goldfish is probably best.%n%nAgar has a more complicated processing chain, but it's nothing compared to Platinum. You'll need even more meat for it.%n%nUse some of the Bacteria to create an Ova Evolutionis culture (15%% chance), and then use that in the vat's controller to make Raw Growth Medium. You'll need IV-tier glass, and Uranium rods. There are also higher tier recipes.%n%n§3Cultures are not consumed when used in the vat.

It goes back to being called SpNt if you craft it into something, like a plate.

# Quest: Play it Again, Sam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiw.name=Play it Again, Sam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiw.desc=So if you thought one Quantum Computer was cool, what about two? You can chain them to get more computing power for your research by connecting them with Optical Connectors the same way you connect to the Research Station. The original QC should have the slave to receive the data from the second one.%n%nOf course, this is kinda expensive, so there's actually another option, and that's to simply extend the first one. You can tear down the last two columns of blocks and then use an itemstack of two hologram projectors to see how a 4 computer rack one would be built. However, you'll need another UV or higher hatch to power it if you use 4 racks, since that will use 5A. You can do the same for up to a 12 stack for 24 computer racks if you want. Just add more of the middle slice, or let a larger stack of hologram projectors show you how it's done.%n%nIf you use 3 racks with 3 Crystalprocessor Mainframes and 1 Advanced Heat Vent each, you'll have enough for the UEV circuit, and it won't overheat either.%n%nA third option for higher computation needs is to finally go back and learn how to set parameters in a useful way. That gives you finer control over the maximum heat your QC reaches and get everything out of it.%n%n§4Remember to let all the heat in your QCs dissipate before changing things.

# Quest: Fluids for Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKlw.name=Fluids for Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKlw.desc=Ok, so let's say you've made some kind of culture, but you want more of it? You only need one per Vat, but they're consumed when making DNA Samples, so you should probably learn how.%n%nTo start off, you'll need to get an eColi Culture.%n%nUse that to make the eColi Bacteria Fluid.§3 (I know the name is completely different, deal with it)§r%n%nCentrifuge that to make Liquid DNA.%n%nAnd combine it with Radon in the Mixer to make FluorecentdDNA.%n%neColi Bacteria Fluid can also be Centrifuged for Plasma Membranes (10%% chance) and EnzymesSollution, so do that as well.%n%nAnd then Centrifuge the EnzymesSollution again for Polymerase.%n%nYou should expect to need a significant amount of eColi Bacteria Fluid if you plan on copying a lot of cultures, or making the hard to make ones.%n%n§3To search for items related to copying cultures, search for 'culture', 'dna sample', or 'plasmid'. You can't do this for the Data Orbs, you have to check the uses of DNA Samples.%n%n§5A bunch of the fluids have incorrect spelling, don't blame me for it.

# Quest: DNA Samples for Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmA.name=DNA Samples for Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmA.desc=To copy cultures, you'll need to make a DNA sample first. Many of these have low chances, but this one's 100%%. I'm sure you can figure it out yourself, but keep in mind that the Modules are not consumed, and that you may wish to use one of the IC2 Crops for the Detergent materials.

# Quest: Data Orbs for Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmQ.name=Data Orbs for Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmQ.desc=After getting your sample you need to encode the information to a Data Orb. Again, many times you'll have to do it repeatedly (the Data Orb is given back if it fails), but in this case it's 100%%.%n%n§3Look at the uses of the eColi DNA Sample to see the recipe.

# Quest: Actually Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmg.name=Actually Copying Cultures
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmg.desc=To copy a culture, you'll need%n1) A Sterilized Petri Dish%n2) A Plasma Membrane (made from Stemcells, or gotten while making EnzymesSollution)%n3) Stemcells%n4) A Data Orb with the appropriate data on it%n5) Liquid DNA%n6) A LuV Bio Lab%n7) A Clonal Cellular Synthesis Module%n%nYou can change out the Data Orb for one with whatever culture you wish to copy. Keep in mind that it might be easier to make a second culture the normal way, and that there's generally an alternative recipe that uses the fluid it produces to make it with a higher chance.%n%nPS: This recipe is the only one in NEI that uses this module, so you can find it if you look, but the number will change, so I can't specify which page.

# Quest: General Purpose Fermenting Bacteria
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmw.name=General Purpose Fermenting Bacteria
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKmw.desc=So if you looked in NEI and tried to figure out how to make this, you were probably confused by the fact that you use the fluid it produces to make it. This is where NEI is lying to you. Like the previous recipe, NEI doesn't show it correctly (they should be around the same page in NEI, they both also appear to produce Sterilized Petri Dishes, (even if that's not true) and both use unique Modules).%n%nIn order to make this, you'll need to make the Rotten Flesh Bacteria culture, get the DNA Sample, and then get the Data Orb. It changes it's name to beta-Lactamase, that's normal.%n%nThen, do the same thing for Common Yeast (get the right Yeast!).%n%nThen you need to use the recipe to combine the information from the Data Orbs and get the Common Yeast Plasmid from that.%n%nLastly, use the Rotten Flesh Bacteria culture, the Common Yeast Plasmid, Penicillin (make it by centrifuging Common Yeast Fluid), and Distilled Water. You want the Transformation Module for this. It's a 100%% chance.%n%nYou'll want to use the normal recipe to make more cultures, since it also becomes beta-Lactamase once you turn it into a DNA Sample.

# Quest: Kevlar

# Quest: Space Elevator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0w.name=Space Elevator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0w.desc=The Space Elevator is a modular structure. It can be equipped with Space Elevator modules, which then can take on different tasks. %n%nInitially, your Space Elevator has 6 module slots that can be used. You can later upgrade that to up to 12 with Mk-II and Mk-III motors. The motor tier also determines the module tier that you can use. The I/O is not shared between modules, each module only sees their own I/O slots. Energy is only provided to the central structure of the Space Elevator and then automatically distributed to all modules.%n%nAfter a module has been inserted and supplied with the right I/O, it can be configured further using parameters.%n%nYou can see in NEI which fluids are pumpable with the Space Pumping Module. It consumes 1A UHV to work. The Gas Type and Planet Type are parameters.%n%nNEI also has an overview of all the ores you can obtain with a Space Mining Module. It needs to supplied with a drone, which will act as catalyst, a set of input items, computation and either Helium, Bismuth or Radon plasma. The plasma will boost both the recipe time and the amount of bonus stacks you get out of a recipe. With its parameters you can adjust parallels, overdrive, and distance. When multiple recipes have the same input and you have the distance set to a value that they share, the module will pick a random one, taking the recipes weights into consideration.%n%nThe space elevator also lets you travel to other planets, but it doesn't get you back though so better keep that in mind! %n%nThe mining module also got a cycle mode. In static mode it will hold its distance while in cycle mode it will change its distance after each recipe check (and you can configure the range and step size of that).%n%n§3Teleportation can be accessed though the controller

You can also grab some more Unknown Crystal Shards from the Rainbow Crystals lying around.%n%nMore importantly you should collect Seaweed from Tau Ceti E. You need it to make UEV circuits, and though you can make it as well, you need some to begin with. The unknown liquid to grow these is however found in lakes and underground on Barnarda C.

# Quest: It's Not Going Bad, I Swear!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKYQ.name=It's Not Going Bad, I Swear!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKYQ.desc=To make your next tier of circuits (Bio Circuits), you need to make Raw Bio Medium. There are three ways of making it.%n%nThe first one requires Stemcells, Unknown Crystal and T-Ceti Seaweed Extract at LuV voltage and 94 Sievert (Plutonium level) in a Bacterial Vat. It makes Raw Bio Medium at 4:1 ratio.%n%nThe second one is basically the first one, but it requires Infinity Catalyst instead of Tritanium at ZPM voltage and 140 Sievert (Enriched Naquadah level) in a Bacterial Vat. It makes Raw Bio Medium at 1:1 ratio.%n%nThe third one is the most efficient, but it requires Biocells (which you don't have yet), and 4 dust of Infinity Catalyst at UV voltage and 150 Sievert (Naquadria level) in a Bacterial Vat. It makes Raw Bio Medium at 1:2 ratio.%n%n§3The second and third ways use a different culture.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKcg.desc=The next material is Infinity Catalyst. Infinity Catalyst needs to be compressed with insane amounts of force. The only machine capable of doing that is a Neutronium Compressor. Let's make one.%n%nTo make the Catalyst, go to Vega B to get the dust. Then use the Neutronium Compressor to make Infinity Catalyst with 64 of the dust.%n%nYou can also do the insane Avaritia recipe to make the Infinity Catalyst, if you want a challenge :P%n%n§3The compressor can also be used to make singularities, culiminating in the Eternal Singularity, used in the alternate recipe.%n%nIf you want to automate singularity creation you can just click with the middle mouse button to modify the number of items in a pattern beyond the normal limits.

# Quest: One Ingot, Infinite Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKcw.name=One Ingot, Infinite Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKcw.desc=Here at Questbook, Inc. we are seriously worried about your health if you got here legitimately. Playing this much might be bad for you. You can always go outside, you know?%n%nBy the way, to make the ingot, it's just a simple Dire Crafting Table recipe. Remember that you were the one that chose to be here.%n%n§3A number of endgame recipes have now opened up. Check the Endgame Goals tab or NEI recipes for the Table to see what they are.%n%nSomething else to note is that there's an automated DCT if you happen to need a lot of these (hint: you will).

# Quest: Collecting Neutrons the Alternate Way

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKdA.desc=Now that you have Infinity, you can use the Avaritia Neutron Collector to get Piles of Neutrons. It does not use any power.%n%n§3Warning: This machine is extremely slow, so you might want to use something to help with that...

# Quest: Soldering's Not Working Anymore
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKdw.name=Soldering's Not Working Anymore
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKdw.desc=After all these advancements, it looks like some things just aren't meant to be. Every machine that your Assembly Line has crafted works, but the most advanced ones so far seem to be... a bit rough around the edges. Further inspection revealed that Indalloy just isn't good enough. It seems that Infinity's neverending vibrations destabilize the joints where the soldering happens, your living circuits have been offering resistance to this crude soldering alloy, however that happens...%n%nIt's likely that new materials will completely break Indalloy's ability to get pieces soldered together. Because of that, it's about time for a new development in this technology, and the previous rejection by your living circuits has given you an excellent idea. Any new material can have some new behavior that will ruin assembling for you, but what if the solder itself learns about these complications and learns how to adjust to them, mutating for them?%n%nThat's right: §aMutated Living Solder§r.%n%nThis sort of chemistry is only possible in a full-scale Chemical Plant, equipped with the most advanced casing: Botmium. On top of that, the catalyst you need to use has been consumed so thoroughly that you were forced to use Infinity for it, on top of the mutating Naquadria. Your Infinity will be lost to the crafting, still, unless you manage to put §9Tungstensteel Pipe Casings§1§r and §4Awakened Draconium Coils§r in your Chemical Plant, which prevent the catalyst from losing durability. Any better coils also have the same effect.%n%nThe new solder itself is a different story. Wetware technology is too primitive for this, and your Bio Cells have refused to bond with any fluid that would serve as its carrier for soldering. When you tried a mixture of hot Tin and Bismuth, it finally worked, but the soldering didn't actually work. It looked like the Bio Cells hadn't learned how to fulfill their new job, which could be fixed by adding an example material as a test subject, something simpler like Infinity Catalyst... but it seemed impossible to bond the cells to the dust. You need more energy... not just loads of EU, something concentrated, hot, fizzling with energy!%n%nYes, everything alive died instantly when you decided to add plasmas instead of hot fluids. No surprise there. However, Bio Cells did survive inside hot fluids, so we just need some temperature control here, and some separation between cell and plasma... yes, Gravi Stars can be used for this. We still need to cool down the plasmas, so that the enhanced cells can mix with them in liquid form, and EU alone would be too expensive. Gelid Cryotheum has proven to be surprisingly efficient, perhaps due to its origins, as a component of a living being, the Blizz.%n%nThere we go! The Mutated Living Solder is now complete. The highly intelligent Bio Cells are energized by the concentrated heat of the plasmas, while keeping a distance from them due to the Gravi Stars' influence, and they analyze the Infinity Catalyst Dust to learn about material instability. This is a very slow process, but it happens at the same time as the plasmas are slowly cooled, using Cryotheum and EU, until the learning process is complete and the Bio Cells fall into the Tin and Bismuth, now in the liquid form that was shown to work before. Finally, armed with their new knowledge, the cells flow through the Naquadria-based, Infinity-reinforced catalyst so that they can mutate in real-time after researching the material they're soldering.%n%nThis should work for any future soldering need, regardless of material. Let's hope so, at least...

# Quest: Industrial Scale Seaweed Production
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKeQ.name=Industrial Scale Seaweed Production
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKeQ.desc=So you probably noticed that the amount of seaweed you'll need to make Bio circuits is kind of...intense. Collecting them yourself is a huge pain, and who wants to program robots? Plus servers. Fortunately, there's now a way to make seaweed.%n%nThe first thing you need is...Seaweed! Use that with Unknown Water you pumped from the same planet to make the culture. Expect this to take a while, as the chances are super low. You'll also need the max tier Bio Lab.%n%nOnce you have the culture you can make SeaweedBroth, by combining it with UnknownNutrientAgar and some other stuff. This can then be made into seaweed.

# Quest: Beyond the Limit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiA.name=Beyond the Limit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiA.desc=To make living solder for your UEV components or bio-circuits, you will need a chem plant with Rugged Botmium Casings. These are not easy to make!%n%nYou can certainly figure out the rest by now, but the Advanced Nitinol may confuse you. You make it out of blocks of Nitinol 60 with a Quantum Anomaly in a Laser Engraver. This means you need to make a UV Cyclotron, and hit several low chances in a row, so good luck with that!

# Quest: Xenoxene Xenoxsis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKnQ.name=Xenoxene Xenoxsis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKnQ.desc=To make the next tier plastic, Radox, or the next tier of SMDs, you will need Xenoxene.%n%nGetting the the Xenoxene Xenoxsis culture is a bit tricky. The recipe is similar to the General Purpose one. Remember that all recipes in this chain are low probablility recipes.%n%nYour first step is to make the Barnardafis culture, then the DNA Sample, and then the Data Orb. If you didn't grab the saplings and dirt previously (to grow more trees for logs), head back to Barnarda C.%n%nUse the same recipe as for the General Purpose one, but use the Data Orb for Barnardafis instead of Common Yeast. You should get the Barnardafis Plasmid.%n%nAgain, it's the same recipe for the next step, but with the TCetiEis Fucus Serratus culture and the Barnardafis Plasmid, this should produce the Xenoxene Xenoxis culture. It's a 7.5%% chance.%n%nYou should probably use the normal alternative recipe to make more cultures, since it's easy to fail copying it too.%n%nYou should be able to figure out yourself how to make Xenoxene once you have the culture.%n%n%n§3After many years, the transformation recipe now even has NEI support!

# Quest: Optical SMDs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkA.name=Optical SMDs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkA.desc=You can now make optical SMDs! They are required for all circuits beyond UEV.%n%nSome of the materials are made in the ABS.

# Quest: Wait, PBI wasn't the last plastic?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsQ.name=Wait, PBI wasn't the last plastic?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsQ.desc=Let's make a brand new plastic! The trees that you found on Barnada C have very interesting properties. Still, you can't just use the extracted radox substance raw. Some serious refining steps are in order!%n%n§6You'll need it for a ton of stuff like UIV and UMV superconductors, UEV+ hatches, or parts of the Dyson Swarm.§r%n%nCompared to the previous plastics, most of the steps required here are not chemical reactions. They are also very slow, so you might want to use a mega multiblock to help with that. This production line also underlines the necessity of large-scale plasma production. You will only need more going forward.%n%n§3The Heavy Radox you get as a byproduct can be used for MkV Naquadah Fuel.

# Quest: Dragonblood
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsA.name=Dragonblood
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsA.desc=For your first batch of Hypogen you will need some Dragonblood. Maybe you already have some lying around somewhere from killing the dragon a long time ago. You have 2 other options though. Bees and the DE Fusion Crafter.%n%nFor the bee path you have to go very deep into the breeding tree, but maybe you have already done that? Check the Bee Breeding tab either way.%n%nIn the DE Fusion Crafter you have 2 recipes. The better one uses an Infinity Egg from Witchery. Without any Witchery you can also just a normal dragon egg for the weaker recipe.%n%nOnce you have a bit of Hypogen you can then use that as a starting point to make more in your DTPF without any Dragonblood. I don't know why it works that way, complain to Colen.%n%nHowever, you will still need more Dragonblood eventually for UMV superconductors.%n%n%n§3There is actually another way to get Dragonblood which is similar to the DE Fusion Crafter recipes but in the mixer instead. Its even slower and less resource efficient. In particular, the dragon egg does not survive the process. So only use that if you are absolutely trying to avoid magic and bees.%n%nJust a reminder: a fluid task just needs you to have the fluid in some container in your inventory. (cell, universal cell, large cell, volumetric cell, etc.)

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzw.name=First Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzw.desc=New plants have grown on your crop sticks. You can harvest the crop by right clicking it.%n%nLeft clicking will destroy the plant and drop a seedbag. This is not guaranteed however, but the chances rise as the maturity does. Collect 8 seeds of any kind to complete this quest.%n%nTo unlock the next quest, you will need the LV scanner.%n%nIf you haven't already, consider building some Filing Cabinets. They make storing and moving large quantities of seeds a breeze. Plus they will properly sort the seeds based on name.

# Quest: Unknown Seeds No More
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC0Q.name=Unknown Seeds No More
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC0Q.desc=You have a lot of unknown seeds already. Use your scanner to scan all the seeds.%n %nSeeds can be planted again to breed better and more resilient crops.%n%nLater you can use your portable scanner to see the crop stats while still in the ground.%n%nGrowability depends on having dirt beneath your crop (4 max), biome (swamp/jungle types are all pretty much the same), air quality (increases up to Y124 and don't place a lot above/around your plants), hydration, and fertilizer.  When the crop tier and plant stats get high enough, they will actually die without enough Growability. This is never a concern if you use a good biome though.%n%nAs long as you water and fertilize them, you can pretty much grow crops anywhere.%n%nIf the Growth stat gets too high, greater than 24 or so, the plant will spread weeds onto neighbors.%n%nSome crops, such as Redwheat or oreberries, require certain light levels to crossbreed or grow.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC0g.name=Speed Up Your Plant Growth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC0g.desc=To speed up the growth process a bit you can use a fertilizer. You will note, however, that bone meal no longer works. A bit of ash, apatite or calcite mixed with some water in a chemical reactor will give you the fertilizer you need. Apply by hand.

# Quest: Potatos, Carrots, Pumpkins and Melons
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC0w.name=Potatos, Carrots, Pumpkins and Melons
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC0w.desc=Your seeds have three different values: Growth, gain, and resistance (GGR).%n%nThe only way to change a crop's GGR without 3rd party tools (like NBTedit!) is through cross breeding. When two plants cross-breed, the resulting plant will have a GGR score that is between both "parent" plants' GGR. Sometimes it will also be a little bit higher or lower. Thus, to obtain high GGR scores you must go through numerous generations of crossbreeding.%n%nThe highest score for GGR is 31, while the lowest is 0.%n%n§3BTW, if you want to skip all this BS, the nbtedit command is /nbtedit me, click root in the upper left, then scroll down to inventory, and find the seedbag (empty your inventory first to make it easier) and click on the icons until you find the page with the stats. Once you've found the GGR stats, select one and click edit in the upper left, make sure to save.%n%n§4Remember that you can §5permanantly brick your character!§4 So make a backup first if you don't know what you're doing, or want to edit your actual character.§r%n%nOf course, you can't do any of this on a server.

# Quest: Weeds

And you can eat as much as you want without getting tired of the food.%n%nEating before you are starving restores saturation and conserves cans.

# Quest: Time for a Spade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE9g.name=Time for a Spade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE9g.desc=This item is a combined Weeding Trowel, Hoe and Shovel. If you're the type that accidentally does things, only use this when necessary, as it's easy to mess up and use it to harvest/destroy your crops when you wanted to get rid of a weed.%n%nYou can use it to get seeds from crops when they're §9immature§r using §6right-click§r at very low rates. Using §4left-click§r when §9immature§r will result in nothing.%n%nIf it's §amature§r, use §6left-click§r to have a higher chance of a seed dropping. Using §4right-click§r when §amature§r will result in lower seed drops than punching it normally.%n%nKeep in mind that the higher the tier/stats of the crop, the lower the chances. By a lot.%n%n§3The formula is 1+tanh((-1)(X+5((-Re/2)+Gr+Ga)/21)/12); X=0 to 16%n%nWhere Re, Gr, Ga are respectively Resistance, Growth and Gain stat of the crop, and X is tier. Don't ask me whether this is for L/R-click, ask bart or look at the code.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFzw.desc=In the next step you cool your Glowing Mashmallow in an HV Vacuum Freezer to make it more stable.%n%nYou still get Weakness II and Nausea II.

# Quest: Dezil's Marshmallow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF0A.name=Dezil's Marshmallow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF0A.desc=In the last step you need to infuse your Marshmallow with some epic food in the thaumcraft infusion altar. Before you can do it you need to unlock the research.%n%nIs this worth it? Is there any enemy worthy of using the buffs this gives on? That's up to you.

# Quest: Analyze Your Crops
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBQ.name=Analyze Your Crops
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBQ.desc=The cropnalyzer is a powered tool used to analyze IC2 crop seedbags. Charge it by placing it in an MV machine; recommended to put an MV battery in it as well to keep it full. To fully analyze a seed bag, you will need to put it through the cropnalyzer four times. If the crop is already planted, it is better to analyze it with the portable scanner instead of breaking it just to scan it - you have a chance of losing the seed every time you break it.%n%nThe cropnalyzer also has a feature called the IC2 Crop Calculator, where you can find the mix of outputs of breeding together any crops. To access the calculator, hit the IC2 side inventory key while holding the cropnalyzer.  You can select any crops available and discover what plants have decent percentages of a result. And no, you can't do the reverse, search for the crops.zip on discord for that (it doesn't have micadia though).%n%nYou can choose up to four crops to breed together. Then click "process" and the bottom row will show the possible crossbreeding outputs, and their weights. You can use the + and - gui buttons to scroll through the row(s) of crops. You can also use a button in the GUI to sort the rows by tier or weight. You can invert the sorting by hitting the sorting button while holding shift.%n%nWhen trying to get a specific crop, you generally want to maximize its percentage. Do this by breeding 2-4 of the same plant together (more is faster). There is no advantage to crossing plant types, it just reduces the %% chance of getting what you want, contrary to what you might think.%n%nUse the crops guide at §9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/IC2_Crops_List[/url]§r for more details.%n%nA large field of stickreeds has a good chance at making lots of valuable crosses. This is because it's decently high tier (they randomly mutate to tiers nearby mostly), and it's really fast, so you can get it to a high stat fast, which you should probably do first. Mutations are random, you can get transformium from stickreed, so keep that in mind. You do tend to get similar crops, so if you want metals, get the metal crops for example. Go to the wiki or spreadsheet (not up to date) to see the attributes that govern similarity.

# Quest: Crop Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBg.name=Crop Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBg.desc=The Crop-Matron is a LV machine that will monitor crops in a 11x11x3 area and automatically apply fertilizer, Weed-EX, and Water as needed. Water can be pumped in directly or use IC2 Universal water cells, normal cells aren't returned when they're used.%n%nThe Crop-Matron is rainproof, but make sure you cover up your power supply (you might find a fancy way to do this), or use an LV battery.  A Lithium Ion will last about 2 hours. %n%nTilled dirt still requires a nearby water block to be hydrated as the Matron will only water the crop, not the soil. Try putting a lily pad on top so it isn't annoying to walk on, or using Garden Soil instead.

# Quest: Weed Ex
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBw.name=Weed Ex
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBw.desc=Weed-EX is used to prevent the growth of Weeds on empty Crop blocks at the cost of some weed-EX. Damage to the crop's quality is illusory, and not true. We have people that have looked at the code, we assure you. §oUnless§r it counts as a weed (venomilia Gr 8+, any other crop Gr 24+), then it loses maybe 1 stat. Maybe. And you can just increase it again too. And it might not take effect even then if you don't apply too much, like a crop matron won't.%n%nUsage:%nWhile holding Weed-Ex, right-click on a Crop to apply it. It can also be placed in a Crop-Matron to automatically apply it to your crops.

# Quest: Reed and Resin
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQA.name=Reed and Resin
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQA.desc=One of the first useful crops you'll get is Stickreed. It's fast growing, and can produce sticky resin and sugarcane (harvest before it reaches full maturity). It's also great for crossing with other crops to raise their stats. One of the best strategies is to get these to around 20/31/10, then breed out from there. Most people will say 23/31/10, but 24+ act like weeds, so it's better to have some wiggle room.%n%nI'll trade you some fertilizer for 2 stacks of each.%n%n§3PS, you don't really need rubber trees if you can get these.%n%nYou'll need a Basic Scanner to scan your Stickreed seeds once you get them, though any set of stats will work. See the quest in LV, and note it requires MV circuits.

# Quest: Metals From the Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQQ.name=Metals From the Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQQ.desc=With higher tier crops you can even increase your ore production. Mixing some of these fibers and leaves with crushed ores can quadruple your output, and some can even be converted directly to dust. Later you can mix these materials to make purified ore with some UU matter.%n%nShow me your ability to get these metal crops and I'll give you some more fertilizer and some decent stat seedbags of rarer crops. Good source crops are essence berries or any of the oreberries.%n%nYou will need the proper oreblock beneath the crop to reach 100 percent maturity. For best growing conditions use dirt in between the oreblock and the crop.%n%nFor Ferru and Aurelia you will have to use a block of metal instead of a GT oreblock - a vanilla oreblock automined from the Twilight Forest will however work. You can also buy some from the coins tab. WAILA will tell you if the crop will accept the block you are using.

# Quest: Water, Water, Everywhere
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQg.name=Water, Water, Everywhere
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQg.desc=Even though you have to plant crops near the water, they don't actually get any hydration unless you apply water manually. Make a hydration cell and use it on your crops to increase their growth speed. %n%nYou can recycle empty cells in a centrifuge.

# Quest: Feeling a Little Like a Noob...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQw.name=Feeling a Little Like a Noob...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGQw.desc=So could you grow me some essence berries so I can level up? You can plant the ones you get from the bushes, or breed up some.%n%nAs a reward, I'll give you a silly seed a friend of mine came up with. It will definitely keep you on your toes.

# Quest: I Prefer to Call it Canola
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRA.name=I Prefer to Call it Canola
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRA.desc=This crop is a great source of seed oil for your bio diesel needs.%n%nYou can try getting it from dandelions, cocoa, potatoes or lemons.

# Quest: Better Than Milk
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRQ.name=Better Than Milk
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRQ.desc=I haven't been feeling well lately. Would you grow me some Terrawart? They're better than milk, since they only remove negative effects, and stack to 64. Really nice when fighting that Alchemist infernal!%n%nThey also have Auramx8, Praecantatiox4 and Victusx4 essentia on them, very useful for the budding thaumaturge. And you can get them by placing a snow block under your netherwart and waiting instead of mutating to get them.

# Quest: Sweet Tooth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRg.name=Sweet Tooth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGRg.desc=Sugarcane or Reed not keeping up with your sugary needs? Sugar beets give 8 sugar per beet. Potatoes or carrots should easily give you sugar beets.%n%nHmm, now I want some candy. Give me some sugar from your beets. I'll share some with you.%n%n§3Electrolyze the sugar into O2 for an easy source.

# Quest: Swipe Swipe

# Quest: More Red, Less Wheat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGyQ.name=More Red, Less Wheat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGyQ.desc=When breeding together crops for an output crop, try to get crops that are close in tier to the output crop, and have similar attributes to the output crop. %n%nFor example, Redwheat has "Red", "Wheat" and "Redstone" attributes and is tier 6. Netherwart has "Red" and is tier 5. Use the cropnalyzer crop prediction mode to see how many points Redwheat has using two Netherwart. %n%nYou'll also want to make sure the light level is between 5-10 for this particular cross breeding to occur. Honestly, it's the worst, condition-wise.%n%nReally though, once you get to MV it's better to make a Glowstone crop and centrifuge it for redstone. Or a redstone block crop. Or just mine it, honestly. Red wheat == Dead wheat.

# Quest: Better(?) Dirt
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAQ.name=Better(?) Dirt
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAQ.desc=With an Assembler and some seedoil, you can turn dirt and sand into Garden Soil.  This optimal soil does not require water nearby and crops do not break when you fall on it.  It can turn into dirt if you run on it, so be careful.%n%nUnlike watered farmland, it doesn't contribute to the humidity stat or speed up IC2 crops though, so don't bother when min-maxing.%n%nSame thing for enchanted earth, lamp of growth, sprinklers, etc.

# Quest: Crop Stats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAg.name=Crop Stats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAg.desc=With the portable scanner, you can get the crop's stats and environmental info while it is still in the ground by right clicking it. It also stays scanned after getting the seed. Look for the portable scanner quest after the EBF in Multiblock Goals. About those stats:%n%n§aGrowth§r:%nHow fast it grows, with higher = faster. Specifically, it increases the growth points your crop gets per growth tick. If it gets to 24+, your crop acts like a weed, so most people say to stay at 23 or less. However, it will only weed other crops under certain conditions.%n%n1) Is in a cardinal direction on the same Y level. 2) Will only affect dirt/grass, or cropsticks or crops 3) If there's a crop there that is §oalso§r a weed, if it's at a maturity level > 1, it §owon't affect it§r 4) If it affects the crop, it'll be replaced with a normal weed%n%n§9Gain§r:%nInfluences chances of how many drops you get, and whether you get any at all. 31 is the best for sure.%n%n§eResistance§r:%nThis stat is responsible for a couple of crops' properties: chances for getting a seed while punching crop, resistance of your crop to trampling (jumping on it), decreases chance of crop dying due to lack of enviromental stats, and resistance of crop to weed spread. It also reduces mutation chance as it goes up (apparently). Aim for around 10 for balance.

# Quest: Metals From the Sky
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAw.name=Metals From the Sky
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAw.desc=You can even create metals not found on Earth using crops! You'll need the proper metal block beneath the crop in order for them to fully mature.%n%nBTW, higher tier crops have a lower chance of dropping seeds, so consider breeding a second one before you try breaking them, ok?

# Quest: New Threads
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHBQ.name=New Threads

# Quest: Genetically Modifying Your Plants
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKqQ.name=Genetically Modifying Your Plants
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKqQ.desc=There are 3 machines crucial to doing this. You'll also need bucketloads of power, and the same (literally) of UUM.%n%nAll 3 can only work on crops up to a certain tier, determined by the tier of the machine you made and the crop you're working with. Basically, it's (crop tier+2)/2, rounded up. So an LV machine can work on T1 crops, but an MV one can work on T3.%n%n§3LV=T1, MV=T3, HV=T5, EV=T7, IV=T9, LuV=T11, ZPM=T13, UV=T15, UHV=T17.§r%n%nFirst is the Crop Gene Extractor:%nIt takes an existing crop seedbag, an empty §2Data Orb§r (See EV quests), and §61A§r while running. Use a circuit to determine what stat to copy to the Data Orb. You'll probably want either 23-31-0, or 31-31-0 for max speed and output, since you won't be breeding from these. Remember to take proper precautions if going over 23, as they will attempt to weed everything around them. There's a significant number of crops, so you'll probably need a ton of Orbs too, unless you want to reuse them. §4Remember to keep a Data Orb or seedbag backup!§r%n%nSecond is the Crop Synthesizer:%nIt takes §24 Data Orbs§r, one for each of the types from the CGE, §51000L of UUM per crop tier/2§r (this is not rounded), and §616A§r while running. It will create a new crop seedbag with the desired stats.%n%nLastly is the Crop Replicator:%nIt takes an existing crop seedbag, §51000L per crop tier of UUM§r, and §66A§r while running. After finishing, it gives you back two of the same seedbag, duplicating it. This takes twice as much UUM, but less power, it's up to you whether that's worth it.

# Quest: Even More Stats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK0Q.name=Even More Stats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK0Q.desc=There's seven more stats to worry about too.%n%n§7Fertilizer§r, §9Water§r, and §4Weed-EX§r are all about how much of these is on the crop stick rather than the crop itself. They're all about how much was applied, and is left of that.%n%n§2Nutrients§r, §1Humidity§r, and §6Air Quality§r are all about the environment. They're also affected by the Fertilizer and Water stats.%n%nNutrients and Humidity are mostly about the right biome, with swamp and rainforest types (hot+humid) being the best, but you can also get some extra stats by setting up right.%n%n§2Nutrients§r:%n3 possible free points from dirt under the farmland block, 2 for plants that require a specific block. So optimally always make sure that the required block is at the bottommost bottom in the column, because it checks in chain, not certain height. For example: cropstick -> farmland -> dirt -> oreblock -> dirt, it will only register 1 dirt, ignoring the one below the oreblock.%n%n5-10 possible points from fertilizing your crops. You can use fertilizer on a crop to increase its nutrients stat. Fertilizer caps at 199 which gives 10 nutrients, but can be applied again only if the crop drops below 100 fertilizer points. So for high stat crops its safe to assume and make tests for 100 fertilizer points as its a given constant unlike 199->100 values. You can apply bonemeal, IC2 fertilizer and Forestry fertilizer to a crop by hand. Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron does this automatically when supplied with fertilizer (the multifarm needs fertilizer to harvest crops as well).%n%n§1Humidity§r:%n2 free points from using dirt as farmland, as when farmland gets hydrated by water(turns darker) it gains 2 humidity points. This is why other blocks for this suck, since they don't give this bonus.%n%n10 possible points from hydrating your crop. Similiar to fertilizing, water can be applied to crop up to 200 points, which is 10 humidity points, altough unlike fertilizer it does not need to drop below value of 100, water can be applied over and over keeping it at constant 200 points. You can apply water to your crop by using IC2 hydration cells by hand, or let your Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron do it automatically. The multifarm needs water to harvest crops as well though.%n%n§6Air Quality§r:%n4 potential free points from empty space around crop. A crop checks for empty spaces to calculate bonus air quality points, it gives up to 4 points, 1 point for each 2 empty spaces. It only counts full blocks or cropsticks though. If you like looks, you'll probably have to sacrifice this.%n%n4 free points from height of your farm. You get 1 free point every 15 blocks startng at Y79.%n79 - 1 point%n94 - 2 points%n109 - 3 points%n124 - 4 points%n%n2 free points from no opaque blocks above the crop. You can place glass above and you won't lose the bonus since it's a transparent block. You cannot use dark glass, several layers of water, or gaseous tenebrae to get around this if your crop likes the dark. Unless you only let it grow at night I guess§..%n%n§aGrowability§r:%nYour crop will require a certain level of NHA, try to reach or surpass this, or the crop will either not grow, or even die (disappear). Each crop is different, and higher tiers (and stats) require more. It's generally easy to meet though, as long as you're in a good biome.%n%nGrowability is determined by the difference between what the crop needs in terms of NHA, and what it actually has. If you have more than what you need it grows faster. This is why you don't want a maxed resistance stat, since higher stats will slow it down.

# Quest: Min-Maxing Crops

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK0g.desc=Breed stickreed until it's around 20/31/10, then create other crops with it, they inherit the stats. Crossbreeding with the ones you got on the way to raise their stats is also good.%n%nSetup camp in a swamp/jungle type biome around Y130, or use the biome changing methods to make one. This is way faster when breeding crops, not just growing them for drops.%n%nUse multifarms, always. You can use them together with the harvesters if you have super fast crops. Or just use more farms. Or add more gearboxes.%n%nDark glass is nice for oreberry crops.%n%nTo avoid weeding, checkerboard up and down on your multifarm. It may look stupid, but no weeds, Gr 23->31, and +2 AQ!%n%nUse fertilia to create more fertilizer.%n%nYou can replace mob farms with crops if you don't care about the other drops. Infernals drop special stuff though.%n%nUse WAs in TE mode to accelerate crops if you need it. Mostly useful for breeding, statting up, and for the primordial berry crop.%n%nAs you tier up, you can create 31/31/0 crops with the machines and UUM. It's up to you whether it's worth it though.%n%nGo do bees if you want something higher than EV tier materials.

# Quest: Electric Boat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACnw.name=Electric Boat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACnw.desc=The electric boat works mostly like a vanilla boat, chugging through the water at a decent pace. It will hopefully drop itself once you crash, which is slightly nicer than the usual sticks. That's all well and good, but what if we utilize the electric engine? Wearing an energy storage device in your chestplate slot, like a batpack or energypack, will cause the boat to drain energy from it and propel you forward at supersonic speed! Doing this will consume about 100 EU per block traveled, so even a decent batpack won't last long!

It is used to manipulate machines from railcraft, remove plates and any other covers (pumps, conveyor modules, etc.) from gregtech pipes and machines as well as breaking certain objects faster, such as tracks. This tool is also used to access certain inventories from Railcraft.%n%nHold a crowbar and shift + right click to attach carts. Click the starting cart then continue to click to add more carts to the link. Carts will act slower the more connections are made.%n%nThe crowbar can be used as a weapon, though it costs twice as much durability on attack (just like any other non weapon tool...).

Especially since you can mine out a vein in a single session once you have a hammer and backpacks.%n%n§c§lWARNING: §r§cUnprotected carts can be knocked off their rails by lightning. Cover the area with blocks to prevent carts from disappearing.%n%nAlso, make sure to keep your cart in one chunk, or use chunkloaders covering the whole area the cart works within. Loading/unloading chunks may cause carts to disappear or duplicate.%n%n§3You should only make these if you want to have fun with them, as anything they can do is better done by other methods, including the Long Distance Fluid Pipeline. Excessive minecart and train use on servers may cause lag and you may be asked to switch later anyway.

Make a loop of track from your base to the oil well.%n2. Place a locking track near the well, and put a fluid loader two blocks above it. The track should be in Locking Mode - use a crowbar to change it.%n3. Use the tank car on the filter in the loader and set it to Immediate mode.%n4. Connect the well to the loader as normal.%n5. Put a fluid unloader under a locking track at your base, and set it the same as the loader.%n6. Automate the locomotive similarly - a fluid loader above a steam locomotive set to manual and filtered to the locomotive.%n%nEither you got it working, you need to do more research, you realized it moves 32 buckets a trip and decided to just walk, or you can go to Discord and ask why anyone would build a train.%n%nItem loaders also exist, but the main use for them may be to refuel your locomotive.

The loader can be placed either directly above the track, or a block higher to give you clearance when riding the train. (You can't actually ride a train unless you sit in a normal minecart.)%n%nThis locomotive runs on any fuel you can burn in a steam boiler, perhaps you will want to use compressed coal blocks or similar. You can use an Item Loader to refuel it.%n%nOnce you have stable electricity in MV, you will likely move to the Electic Locomotive.

# Quest: Lighting Up a Large Area, With Electricity
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHuw.name=Lighting Up a Large Area, With Electricity
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHuw.desc=Now that you have a vacuum freezer, you can liquify compressed air cells and centrifuge them for rare gases. You'll need those to make the incandescent bulb for these lights. As long as they have EU, these lights can shoot a beam or do narrow or wide cones. Use the wrench to change modes, and shift right-click to invert.%n%nIt's better to provide power to an Ender IO capacitor and then power these machines with RF, instead of powering directly with GT EU, because they don't work well with GT's EU amp system, and will draw a whole EU packet for a single RF.

# Quest: EnderIO Lights
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHvA.name=EnderIO Lights
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHvA.desc=Enderio also has its own lights. These lights have a radius of 8 blocks vs the normal 7.

# Quest: Carpenter's Blocks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIcA.name=Carpenter's Blocks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIcA.desc=Yet another custom block system! Carpenter's blocks are crafted blank and placed in-world, and then plain block textures applied to them. The blocks must not be Tile Entities, so Botany blocks don't work correctly with them, but GT Stones like Red Granite, and any colored clay or vanilla glass block will work. Some Chisel glass types will work, and Ztones blocks and Tinted Glass also work.%n%nThe Garage Door requires a block at the top to hang "down" from, but can pretty much be any length.  A redstone signal on any block next to the Garage Door blocks will open or close the door. The open/close will propagate across multiple vertical doors, so you can setup non-square doors. Sneaking and right-clicking with an empty hand will change the door's polarity.%n%nThe pressure plates are player-only activation, making them great for doors into your base.%n%nThe hatches must be clicked on the side of a block to place. They can be handy for protecting you from crucible...byproducts.%n %nThere is a lot more block shapes possible, check NEI for "Carpenter's" to see the options.%n%nThe Chisel allows you to chisel blocks while attached to a Carpenter's block.%n%nThe Hammer allows various functions.%n%nHammer on door - changes door shape type%nSneak Hammer on door - Changes from iron to wooden behavior%nSneak Hammer on lever - Changes polarity (which direction is on/off)

# Quest: Catwalks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM3g.name=Catwalks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM3g.desc=The Catwalks Mod adds several cosmetic blocks to deck out your factory.%n%nScaffolds and Builder's Scaffolds are useful for building up in the air before you get access to flight. They can be climbed like ladders, and break instantly when punched. You will also not fall off of them if you let go of movement keys while climbing. If you right-click the Builder's Scaffold with a solid block, the scaffold will be replaced by that block.%n%nCatwalks can connect to each other to form a wide passageway. You can decorate them by attaching Caution Tape or Rope Lights, the latter provide dim lighting.%n%nCaged Ladders give you a way to move up and down without a risk of falling off. Climbing them is much faster than vanilla ladders.%n%nSupport Columns are purely decorative. They connect to each other in all directions. They also work as ladders.%n%nSturdy Rails let you run minecart tracks across gaps without supports. Right-click the Sturdy Powered Rail with a Blowtorch to power it permanently, you don't need a redstone torch. If you don't have enough distractions already, use them to build a rollercoaster!%n%nThe Blowtorch lets you remove railings or even the floor from a catwalk by right-clicking. Use it to make an opening to let you walk onto the catwalk, or if you don't know what an "OSHA violation" is. The same function can be performed by a GT or Forge-compatible wrench, so you don't actually need to make this.%n

betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEg.desc=Automated Farms, tree breeding, and more.....

# Quest: Forestry core block
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQQ.name=Forestry core block
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQQ.desc=This sturdy casing is the basis for almost all machines in Forestry, essentially being the forestry equivalent of a machine casing.

# Quest: The Carpenter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQg.name=The Carpenter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQg.desc=The carpenter is similar to an automatic crafting table. It has an item input slot and a storage slot for the recipes. Some recipes need an additional fluid like water, creosote, honey or molten redstone. With the carpenter you can make farmblocks, woven backpacks, bee and tree analysers and many more.%n%nThe carpenter needs power to work. You can use a GT cable or a battery box to connect to the machine or make some forestry, railcraft or buildcraft RF engines.%n%n§3PS: Yes it's a pain in the ass to automate, just make one for each thing you want to make.

# Quest: Thermionic Fabricator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRA.name=Thermionic Fabricator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRA.desc=The thermionic fabricator is used to craft electron tubes and stained glass. It requires redstone flux (RF) energy to run.%n%nIt is your first machine made in the carpenter. Once warmed up, it needs to maintain a certain heat level to operate. The amount of power supplied will determine how much heat will be generated. If you do not supply enough power to maintain the current temperature it will slowly drop. It will continuously draw power, so disconnect it if you don't need it.

# Quest: A Series of Tubes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRQ.name=A Series of Tubes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRQ.desc=Before you can craft your first farm block you need apatite tubes. Make some apatite rods first with a lathe, then use a forge hammer to join them into long apatite rods. You need golden bolts and a red alloy plate.%n%nPut some glass or sand into your thermionic fabricator and make your first tubes.%n%n§3You can also use the circuit assembler for a better output. Why did we have you make the TF again?

# Quest: The Multifarm
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRg.name=The Multifarm
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRg.desc=The smallest farm you can build requires 36 farm blocks (3x4x3 - the largest is 5x4x5 or 100 farm blocks). Place the underlying blocks corresponding to the farm type you built. In this case, Stone Bricks. You can place these blocks beside or under the multi structure, but not the layer above. It will search 6 blocks above these for dirt/farmland/sand/soul sand/humus depending on farm type, with the appropriate crops, saplings, etc on top of that.%n%nYou can use different modes to collect different crops. Arboretum for trees, infernal for nether wart and so on. You can even mix and match modes on the same farm - cutting trees down for wood in part, and collecting fruit from trees without destroying it in another, for example. So long as they're on different sides, at least.%n%n§YYou may need to experiment a bit to see what works, but §9§n[url]https://ftbwiki.org/MultiFarm#Managed_Farms[/url]§r has a decent list, though it doesn't specify cotton for managed crop farms for example. It might be a GTNH change, I dunno. A number of crops have an added IC2 crop version as well, so you may prefer those for the higher yield if you level them up. Orchard mode works with Pam's, and Witchery, just to save you some time. Pam's nether crops however don't seem to work at all though.

# Quest: Farm Logic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRw.name=Farm Logic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACRw.desc=This chip allows you to select the farm type (when combined with the right electron tubes), and not use the default of growing trees. Unless that's what you want, in which case you don't need it. %n%nFor each circuit tier, you can configure 1/4 more of your farm.

# Quest: Changing Your Foresty Circuit Configuration
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACSA.name=Changing Your Foresty Circuit Configuration
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACSA.desc=The (forestry) soldering iron is a tool used for attaching electron tubes to circuit boards in order to manipulate how an electrical engine works or to program multifarms, as well as upgrading the squeezer or centrifuge. Honestly, you'll probably only use it for the multifarm though.%n%nOnce electron tubes have been attached to a circuit board they cannot be removed, only replaced. The circuit board is automatically crafted as soon as the basic recipe requirements are met, so it's best practice to first place your electron tubes and then add the circuit board.%n%nThe soldering iron can also be used to remove the circuit board from electrical engines, multifarms, squeezers and centrifuges by opening the machine's GUI and left clicking with the soldering iron on the circuit board slot.

# Quest: Heating Coils
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACSQ.name=Heating Coils
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACSQ.desc=Your thermionic fabricator needs heating coils to function. So combine some magnetized (requires polariser) steel rods with some copper wire and make some.%n%n§3Why is this a separate quest again?

# Quest: Finding Apatite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTA.name=Finding Apatite

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTQ.desc=You can supply and extract items from the farm by using farm hatches that are connected to pipe systems. %n%nSupplying items%nThe farm hatch is clever enough to know which item goes where. If an item isn't appropriate for the farm's configuration, the hatch will simply reject it.%n%nExtracting items%nAny item that is harvested by the Multifarm is automatically ejected by the farm hatches into inventories or pipes. Pipes can be used to extract from other sides. You may need more than one, or a better conveyor if it isn't extracting fast enough for you.

# Quest: Multifarm: Valve
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTg.name=Multifarm: Valve
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTg.desc=Most farms require water for hydration purposes. Although you can do it manually by supplying it through liquid containers (such as cans), you can also automate the process by using farm valves.%n%nBy connecting fluid pipes into the farm valve and supplying water, you can automatically fill the farm's water tank.%n%nIf it hasn't rained for a while, the required water will go up, up to 1500%%. Use an Everfull Urn, or Reservoir (RIO) for serious water needs.

# Quest: Multifarm: Control
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTw.name=Multifarm: Control
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTw.desc=You can control which fields of your farm work by applying a redstone signal to the control block. You can either shut down the whole farm by applying a redstone signal from top or below or you can disable a specific side by applying a redstone signal on the matching side of the control block.

# Quest: Multifarm: Gearbox
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACUA.name=Multifarm: Gearbox
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACUA.desc=To power your farm and have it automatically harvest crops, you will need at least one farm gearbox to supply power. You can use either RF or EU. If you use EU, make sure to use a cable to allow conversion. Farm operations can be hastened with additional gearboxes.%n%nTesting has shown that splitting the amps to 4 gearboxes (4A ULV) works better than sending 1A LV to 4 gearboxes.%n%nA max sized IC2 Crop farm (5x4x5) using all space possible with max stat seeds (31/31/0) on a fast crop needs only 6A ULV to keep up.%n%nSimilarly, a max sized small farm (3x4x3) using all space possible with max stat seeds (31/31/0) on a high tier, moderate speed crop needs only 4A ULV.%n%nSending more power to the same gearbox doesn't work. If it can get to max RF capacity but your farm can't keep up, sending more power won't help, so add more gearboxes.%n%nIn addition, you lose 2 EU from the the energy emitting device for every A of ULV (which is only 8 to begin with), so it's not nearly as efficient as using LV or higher. Just keep in mind that more A to more gearboxes is better than to the same one.%n%nOf course, if you mix your slower crops with your faster ones, you aren't likely to need to min-max to this extent.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBA.name=Why No, This is Not Fit For Human Consumption
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBA.desc=Taking the biomass from the Fermenter and using it in a still will give you Ethanol. Not really worth it for power, but useful if you want to turn it into ethylene.  You could set it up on an old steam setup with nothing better to do to get a more useful power source out of it, or use the Ethanol to power the setup and the forestry farm.

# Quest: Better Fermenter Outputs

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI1w.desc=If you're tired of constantly replacing branchcutters, this Industrial Grafter is rechargeable.%n%n§3Or you could just make better ones.

# Quest: Papaya
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKIA.name=Papaya
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKIA.desc=The Papaya tree produces Papayas, which produce the most Fruice Juice. Sluuuurp!%n%n§aPapaya and Fruit Juice Get!

# Quest: U-238 Tu-Wait, Seriously?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK0w.name=U-238 Tu-Wait, Seriously?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK0w.desc=If you want IC2 crops to work with the multifarm, you now need this. Get the U-238 from thorium, and the endereyes from either your crops, villagers, or the normal way in HV. It also only searches 6 blocks above the farm structure block to prevent lag. So goodbye MF stacking, you always looked dumb, and didn't make any sense.%n%nThe largest size supports ~1100 crops, while the smallest supports ~600 depending on your layout if you use it for IC2 crops. This is because it will look for crops up to 5 blocks out further than normal in this mode (In the cardinal directions, it's further out in the corners. Just try it out, it's hard to describe). They're the same size as in previous versions, so you don't need to rejigger them.%n

# Quest: BEGONE, LAG! Also, Bats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK1A.name=BEGONE, LAG! Also, Bats
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK1A.desc=Lag = Butterflies in this case, since they like to pile up just outside of chunk loading range. Also, they're annoying since they convert regular trees into more forestry ones, one leaf block at a time. Which causes more of the buggers to spawn. Fortunately, the settings we use prevent too many from being present at once, but still, they're annoying.%n%nThe solution to this is to kill them. Also, the bats. Stupid Thaumcraft warp. Use the (potentially unfinished) Pest Killer to do so.%n%nNotes: Hydrogen Cyanide has a recipe now. Both it and Formaldehyde require a Chemical Plant. It doesn't appear to use any of the Formaldehyde up though. The range is apparently 5x5 chunks, not blocks. It also only runs once every 30s or so?%n%n§3PS: If you experience problems using it (more than already mentioned), raise a ticket on github.

# Quest: Combustion Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALKw.name=Combustion Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALKw.desc=The combustion engine combusts things for power like a car engine does. You need water in it if it's over 100 degrees, or it will explode. Don't run out of water! You turn it on with a redstone signal.%n%nYour options for fuel are:%nOil @30RF/t for a total of 150K%nEthanol @40RF/t for a total of 360K%nDiesel @60RF/t for a total of 1,500K%n%n§3Make sure to use Oil, not raw, light, medium, or heavy oil.

# Quest: Kinesis Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLA.name=Kinesis Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLA.desc=To transfer RF power more than 1 block, you'll want some kinesis pipes. Use a wooden one first to connect to the pipe network, then other types to transfer it. That said, they seem to be lossy somewhat, so conduits are better, if more expensive. Also, you need capacitors to store the RF anyway.

# Quest: Coast Sequoia

betterquesting.quest.n7yjRSr0R7O2agebw73FGA.desc=Check the NEI pages to see all the nice recipes this machine can handle for you. Great to craft GT components in bulk.

# Quest: One Fluid Tank to Store it All!!
betterquesting.quest.tQecVBhjRRyfR3sqeNBrtA.name=§6§lOne Fluid Tank to Store it All!!
betterquesting.quest.tQecVBhjRRyfR3sqeNBrtA.desc=If you ever thought that the standard super tanks or quantum tanks were still too small then the YOTTank is the next option.%n%nThe YOTTank compared to the TFFT might only be able to store one fluid instead of 25 fluids. However it makes up for this downside by not having to share any of the fluid storage space with any other fluids. It also does not require any energy input or maintenance requirements.%n%nIf all you want to do is store a large amount of one fluid type then look no further then the YOTTank. It has a special ME input hatch for ae2 connections while having expandable storage blocks. The tank can be both upgraded with the fluid storage blocks and can be increased in height to hold any more fluid.%n%nSo if you want to store your fluid in style then look no further then the YOTTank.%n§3%nIf your having issues searching for the fluid storage blocks for the YOTTank in NEI then search for: fluid cell block%n

# Quest: Something From Nothing pt 2
betterquesting.quest.-1GoIXIXR029oc0Ge6sRGg.name=§6§lSomething From Nothing pt 2
betterquesting.quest.-1GoIXIXR029oc0Ge6sRGg.desc=This multiblock works just as a normal drilling rig, but with the power of §5§l§oTechnology §rit won't reduce the underground field size so the output will always be the same.

# Quest: Multiblock Tanks... Railcraft Tanks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALQ.name=§6§lMultiblock Tanks... Railcraft Tanks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALQ.desc=576 buckets of fluid, that should be enough to store all the creosote you have accumulated thus far. If that isn't enough you can make this tank bigger. The smallest tanks are 3x4x3 while the biggest are 9x8x9.%n%nFluid will auto-output without any pumps if you place a valve on its bottom side at the center. The output rate is 1000 L/t so twice as fast as a GT HV Pump Cover. You can color the tank with Buildcraft paintbrushes and the GT spray can.%n%nIf you still use Railcraft tanks in later tiers, you boost the output rate by using pumps.

# Quest: You Are Now Prepared, Hopefully!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASg.name=§6§6§a§9§8§7§6§5§4§3§2§1§0§3§f§k§f§l§6§lYou Are Now Prepared, Hopefully!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASg.desc=No matter where you got this smeltery from, you have one now. Time for some casting!%n%nThe aluminium oreberries can be planted on cropsticks, and macerated to get small quantites of aluminium for molds if you can't find aluminium gravel.%n%nNote: The book says a 3x3 base, but you can make a smeltery with a smaller base. Taller/wider smelteries can do more items at one time, conserving fuel.%n%n§3The smeltry does not double ores in GTNH. Later machines will help you there.

# Quest: The Water Dilemma
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASw.name=§6§lThe Water Dilemma
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASw.desc=Finite water is a problem. But fear not, there are solutions! I shall guide you to a steady supply of water. The Railcraft water siding tanks provides enough water to last the early game.%n%nThe humidity of a biome is very important and will increase the base fill rate. If it is raining, the tank will fill much quicker. One block of the water siding tank must see sky for the maximum output. The best part is that you don't need a pump to extract water. Tanks and pipes placed next to it will be autofilled by the water siding tank.

# Quest: Time to Get Some Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATA.name=§6§lTime to Get Some Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATA.desc=You need steel? Uhh... fine. Let's get busy...%n%nThe Bricked Blast Furnace (BBF) can share walls with other ones, just like most GT multiblocks. How will this affect the air quality though...%n%nIf you are short on Stone Dust, you can get more by macerating cobblestone.%n%nIf you spawn near a biome with Hardened Clay you can macerate it to get the clay dust you need. You can also use brick blocks from Villages to get brick dust in the macerator.%n%nCrafting the Worktable from Forestry can make it easier as you can use all the buckets for crafting in one click.

# Quest: EBF-Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATQ.name=§r§6§l§5§l§o§l§r§6§lEBF-Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATQ.desc=In order to get aluminium ingots, you need an Electric Blast Furnace. It's another very important step towards victory, so let's get started.%n%nGetting the Mica for the heating coils might be a little tricky, but you can use a substitute for the first tier of coils. %nYou need 2 LV hatches with 4A of 32V total, or 3 LV hatches with MOOOORE power if the multiblock is not fully repaired. %nIn order to not scrape by for Nickel, check out the quest Source of Nickel in the Novice Thaumaturgy tab.%n%n§rA few recipes produce CO2/SO2 as a fluid. This fluid can be collected by placing a fluid output hatch on the top layer of the EBF. You could also enable fluid voiding in the EBF controller block GUI. For recipes with such a C02/S02 output you must do one or the other or the EBF will not start.%nThe amount of fluid recovered depends on the tier of the muffler hatch.%n%nBart's Platinum Series recipes output fluids on the BOTTOM and are NOT affected by the mufffler hatch tier, so if you want to do Platinum Stuff later, remember that.%n%nMoron always says - Make Muffler Moint Mup. Or point up, anyways. Before the launch, don't forget to fix maintenance issues and put a programmed circuit if necessary.%n%nIf you want a really fancy EBF, you can add more input fluid hatches and store different fluids in each one.%n%nThe EBF also has a heat adjustment of 100K for each power tier above or below MV. You can only make LV energy hatches right now, but installing two LV energy hatches will overclock the EBF to MV power, eliminating the 100K penalty and setting the initial heat to 1801K.%n%nAs you upgrade your EBF over the course of the game, this heat adjustment will increase. Two MV energy hatches (overclocking to HV) will add +100K, two HV energy hatches (overclocking to EV) will give +200K, and so on. Coils only set the base value. This adjustment does not apply to the Volcanus.%n%nIf the pollution gets really bad, check in GT++ Multiblocks for a pollution scrubber, or upgrade your Muffler.

# Quest: More Heat - Kanthal Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATg.name=§6§lMore Heat - Kanthal Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATg.desc=Better materials need higher temperatures. You can just exchange the old coils with the new ones. Kanthal coils let you reach 2700K. You can even reuse the old coils in your Pyro or to make other machines, how fancy is that! If you don't have any other place to use them, you can macerate or arc furnace them too.%n%nIf you dont have a Vacuum Freezer yet, then cool the hot ingots in an MV Chemical Bath with Coolant.%n%nRemember that you can get an upgraded OC (4/4) instead of a regular one (4/2) if your coils are 1800K above the recipe temperature, as well as a EU discount. This applies to every 900K or 1800K above, so you should try to upgrade your coils as soon as you can.

# Quest: Nichrome Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATw.name=§6§lNichrome Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATw.desc=To reach 3600k so you can process higher tier materials like tungsten, you need nichrome heating coils.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUQ.name=§6§lAt the End of...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUQ.desc=...the universe everything freezes eventually. But waiting for the heat death of the universe might take too long. Therefore we present you the vacuum freezer. It should be good enough to cool your hot stuff.%n%nIngots that go through the EBF above a certain temperature will come out as hot ingots that need to be cooled.%n%nYou will need a minimum of 16 frost proof machine casings, the rest depends on your setup.

# Quest: An Unexpected Bonus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUg.name=§7§6§lAn Unexpected Bonus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUg.desc=Because we're nice developers, we decided to add a little bonus if you happen to compress charcoal. Use it in the bricked blast furnace, or in a boiler, it yields 10 times the burn time of a piece of charcoal. So one charcoal for free. This bonus only occurs on the first compression step. (But for fanciness, you should definitely get a quintuple one!)%n%n§3Of course they're kinda useless unless you're using BBFs or boilers, though you can use them to make industrial diamonds.

# Quest: High-Speed Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUw.name=§6§lHigh-Speed Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUw.desc=Sure, those coke ovens are nice, but they aren't even remotely fast enough to keep up with a large steam boiler. Luckily, there is an upgrade available! The creosote oil will not be produced, but the process will speed up dramatically. Who needs that nasty yellowish flammable stuff anyway...

# Quest: Smelt All the Things Stack-Wise...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVQ.name=§6§lSmelt All the Things Stack-Wise...

# Quest: An Industrial Mobfarm
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABdQ.name=§6§lAn Industrial Mobfarm
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABdQ.desc=§6§lExtreme Entity Crusher§r is your new and probably the §lbest§r spawner/grinder, with this you are not only able to get drops without any §lTPS§r issues but also with style and §lextreme§r efficiency.%n%nOf course that depends on the quality of your sword, damage and looting are the only stats that matter (weapon is optional since structure requires spikes and if you want to use it you need to add §cULV§r input bus to the structure).%n%nIf normal drops aren't your thing then you can build blood magic ritual "Well of Suffering" on top of the multiblock (you still get items but at a very slow rate).%nAlso generates liquid xp (always 120L) and can spawn infernal mobs if possible (uses x8 power with every infernal spawn so you need to take into account that energy usage will spike once in a while so be prepared for that!).%n%n§lNotes:§r%nIn case of any problems with multiblock animation just use soldering iron on the machine to disable it.

# Quest: HSS-G Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB2w.name=§6§lHSS-G Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB2w.desc=To process more advanced materials like HSS-E, HSS-S and naquadah you need more than 4500K. Time to upgrade your EBF to 5400k.

# Quest: Low-Pressure Boiler Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACLw.name=§6§lLow-Pressure Boiler Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACLw.desc=The low pressure boiler tank is the easiest way to make steam with an RC boiler. The firebox needs this tank on top to produce steam. The bigger the boiler the slower it heats up, but it will produce more steam when heated up.%n%nExtract steam by attaching a pipe to the boiler tank.%n%nKeep in mind that it consumes many times more fuel to heat up a boiler than to keep it at top temperature.

# Quest: Railcraft Steam Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMA.name=§6§lRailcraft Steam Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMA.desc=As an alternative way to make steam you can use the railcraft boilers. They require at least one firebox.%n%nMore than one size is possible: (1x1 which the quest gets you to make) 2x2 and 3x3.%n%nProvide water and coal to the firebox. Make sure you don't run out of water or...BOOM.%n%nEach boiler needs 1, 2 or 3 layers of tanks on top, equal to the size (1x1x1, 2x2x2, or 3x3x3) - see the quests linked below.

# Quest: Liquid-Fuelled Firebox
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMQ.name=§6§lLiquid-Fuelled Firebox
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMQ.desc=Cresosote oil into steam! After you make your first steel you are able to craft a liquid fueled firebox.%n%nDiesel, ethanol, creosote and bio diesel all work well here. This will also require a boiler tank - see the quests linked below.

# Quest: High-Pressure Boiler Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMg.name=§6§lHigh-Pressure Boiler Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACMg.desc=After you make steel you are able to craft a high pressure boiler tank. The upgraded version increases the temperature and produces more steam than the low pressure version. It will take longer to warm up, so make sure to keep it well fed!%n%nExtract steam by attaching a pipe to the boiler tank.%n%nKeep in mind that it consumes many times more fuel to heat up a boiler than to keep it at top temperature.

# Quest: Automation, Tier 1
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACtw.name=§6§lAutomation, Tier 1
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACtw.desc=Do you want to automate your smeltery because you're planning to make stacks and stacks of glass blocks? %n%nNo problem, craft a large bronze pipe and place it under the faucet. Make sure to connect the pipe to the faucet using a wrench. Now the molten fluid will flow inside the pipe. Under or next to the pipe you have to place the casting basins or tables.%n%nA hopper and a chest underneath will auto-output products from the casting blocks. %n%nNOTE: Faucets will output precisely 144L each activation if you toggle it off immediately. That's going to have some uses later on...

# Quest: Automation, Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACuA.name=§6§lAutomation, Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACuA.desc=You want a better automation than using pipes? Sure, craft a comparator and link it with redstone dust placed on the ground. The redstone needs to be adjacent to the faucet to activate the crafting process.

# Quest: 2x Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACuQ.name=§6§l2x Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACuQ.desc=Steel production is so slow. If you got enough bricks and clay, build a second BBF. Build it attached to the first one, so they can share a wall and you will save some bricks, clay and concrete.%n%n§4Note that this will generate twice as much pollution in total - consider moving them further away.

# Quest: 4x Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACug.name=§6§l4x Steel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACug.desc=Not even two BBFs are fast enough...Can you figure out how to save the most bricks making 4?%n%n§3PS: If you can't, this pack may not be for you.%n%n§4Note that this will generate massive amounts of pollution - have you considered the Nether?

# Quest: Why One Coke Oven When You Can Have Ten?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACuw.name=§6§lWhy One Coke Oven When You Can Have Ten?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACuw.desc=Your bricked blast furnace uses coal like hell and your steam boilers do too? Well it's time to make more coke ovens and automate them a bit. Wooden fluid pipes and tin item pipes will help you reach your goal. You can use either faucets with redstone clocks or LV pumps to empty the creosote. For the charcoal, hoppers are easy to get once you have an assembler.%n%nUnlike GregTech multiblocks, coke ovens must have 1 space separating each oven.%n%nSearch NEI for a more efficient way to make coke oven bricks.%n%nRemember that tin item pipes require a steel wrench to dismantle them. %n%nThe whole coke-oven process generates a lot of pollution, so consider putting it further away.

# Quest: Better Than Duct Tape
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC8w.name=§6§lBetter Than Duct Tape
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC8w.desc=Using a soldering iron tool to remove the "burned out circuits" message is cheaper than duct tape. %n%nThe soldering iron requires one soldering material item and 10,000 EU. Valid soldering materials are fine wires, rods, and ingots made from either tin, lead, or soldering alloy. The soldering iron will consume the first such material it finds in the player's inventory. Since you'll likely have more than enough, Fine Wires of Soldering Alloy are probably best.%n%nYou can also use it to adjust the redstone strength from weak to strong emitted by GT machines.%n%nAlso, while holding it all pipes, wires, and cables will look very small, so that you can see everything past them, and also be sure of the exact connections.%n%nIn order to "complete" the quest you'll need to charge the soldering iron after you craft it.%n%nFor the other problems other tools are necessary. Keep in mind that you can put all needed tools in a toolbox to fix all problems in one click.%n%nPossible problems                Tool to fix%n"Pipe is loose."                    Wrench%n"Screws are loose."           Screwdriver %n"Something is stuck."            Soft Mallet %n"Platings are dented."           Hammer %n"Circuitry burned out."

# Quest: Less Power Loss
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC9A.name=§6§lLess Power Loss
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC9A.desc=When you reach MV tier you can make your own duct tape in case you have to move your multiblock machines around. Duct tape will fix all maintenance problems in any multiblock machine.

# Quest: Powderbarrels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-Q.name=§6§lPowderbarrels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-Q.desc=Powderbarrels are pretty bad in the implosion compressor. They are good for prospecting though. Craft one stack.

# Quest: TNT
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-g.name=§6§lTNT
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-g.desc=TNT is much more powerful than the powderbarrel but much harder to craft. There are LV and HV ways to craft. At LV you need heavy or light fuel to make some toluene which can be solidified to gelled toluene. Alternatively you can use sugar and plastic dust in a chemical reactor to make toluene more efficiently. Mix it with sulfuric acid to make TNT.%n%nThe HV petrol way requires an oil cracking unit to make all kinds of cracked fuel or cracked naphta and a distillation tower to extract toluene from that.%nThough you can also go the wood tar route in mid-MV.

# Quest: iTNT
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-w.name=§6§liTNT
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC-w.desc=Industrial TNT is the HV variant of TNT. It explodes with more power, and you can't pick it up. Not by hand anyway

# Quest: Dynamite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_A.name=§6§lDynamite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_A.desc=Dynamite is the most basic explosive you can use in the implosion compressor.%nMix some paper, string and glyceryl trinitrate in a chemical reactor to get dynamite.

# Quest: Time to Drill for Oil!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_Q.name=§6§lTime to Drill for Oil!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_Q.desc=Pumps are nice but you're going to reach a point where you'll want MOOOOOOOOOOOOORE oil. This multiblock will help with that but you'll need to search for oil using a seismic prospector. You can find raw, light, medium, and heavy oil. There's also a chance to find natural gas.%n%nHigher tiers of power will drill faster. You need to upgrade the energy hatch corresponding to the power tier. %n%nLater you can upgrade the oil drilling rig so it extracts from more than one chunk at a time.%n%nYou need mining pipes in the controller. If you need more than 64, you can use an input bus.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on any side. And set a waypoint with JourneyMaps so you don't forget where you placed it!%n%nSpace dims can also have fluids beneath bedrock. For info, check the Tips and Tricks tab.

# Quest: Let's Get Crackin!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_g.name=§6§lLet's Get Crackin!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC_g.desc=Cracking oil products like light and heavy fuel with the oil cracker is faster and more efficent than using a chemical reactor, producing 25 to 50 percent more output, depending on which cracking method it's doing (steam does 50%%, hydro does 25%% but consumes 20%% less hydrogen). Cracked products will result in additional by-products in the distillation tower. It is a smart idea to get this multiblock since you are going to need TONS of industrial TNT from Toluene for advanced tier rockets. %n%nThe 16 coils form 2 vertical rings of 8 on either side of the controller. The casings between the rings can be replaced with a hatch for steam/hydrogen input. Energy hatch and maintenance hatch can replace any of the casings. The input product hatch and output product hatch must replace one of the casings outside of the coils.%n%nHint: Only GT/Railcraft steam can be used, not ic2 steam. You can use a fluid heater to make it instead of a boiler.%n%n§3The circuit goes in the controller.%n%n§3PS: I listed all the cracker recipes on the spreadsheet for you to look at in a convenient format. Now you can easily compare which oil path to take!

# Quest: You Smell Like a Distillery!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAA.name=§6§lYou Smell Like a Distillery!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAA.desc=This bad boy will tremendously boost the byproducts of your cracked fuel or pyrolyse oven. This way you can make industrial TNT, polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene and other plastics more efficiently. You'll also need this for the platline.%n%nYou'll need to make EV circuits in a cleanroom to build this machine.%n%nFor hatches, you can choose your own tier. 1 MV energy does most of the useful recipes. 2 MV energy or 1 HV energy hatch will cover almost all the rest.%n%nYou will need 1 input hatch, and at least 5 output hatches. An output bus will capture any solid outputs.%n%n§3PS: I listed all the DT recipes on the spreadsheet for you to look at in a convenient format. Now you can easily compare which oil path to take!

# Quest: Still Not Enough Charcoal?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDQ.name=§6§lStill Not Enough Charcoal?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDQ.desc=This oven is the best way to get charcoal and creosote (x50 faster than Railcraft's coke oven) and other byproducts. You will need tons of bronze, iron and steel to build it, but it's worth it. Finally, it will be possible to dismantle the charcoal pit.%n%nWith Cupronickel coils the oven is a bit slower. Each coil tier speeds up the charcoal production.

# Quest: It's Time to Get More Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEA.name=§6§lIt's Time to Get More Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEA.desc=As soon as you have the ability to store energy in large quantities, it would be necessary to have a way to generate energy in large quantities. You need a large bronze boiler. But in order to make this boiler, you will need a mountain of bronze. This boiler produces 800L of steam per tick. This is enough to run 10 basic steam turbines.%n%nThe large boiler can use either water or distilled water. Water is consumed at a rate of 1L of water per 150L of steam.%n%nTo make a large boiler you must make a 3x3x5 structure with Bronze Pipe Casings in the center of the middle 3 levels. The lowest level must contain at least 1 or 2 input hatches, 1 or 2 input buses, 3 or 4 fireboxes, 1 muffler, and one maintenance hatch. The lowest level can not contain any plated bricks. All hatches, buses, and mufflers must have their back side touching a firebox. The output hatch can be placed on any of the upper 4 levels.%n%n§c§cWarning: Different from other boilers, Large Boilers must contain water at all times while active. If at any point the Boiler runs out of water while it is active, it will explode.

# Quest: Steam is Never Enough
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEg.name=§6§lSteam is Never Enough
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEg.desc=Now you can make Advanced Circuits, which means it's time to build a Large Steel Boiler. Each one of these produces 1000 EU/t in Steam, which means you will need several Steam Turbines to convert it all to power! Keep in mind that the MV ones are less efficient, so calculate your losses when building your setup.

# Quest: Moooooore Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEw.name=§6§lMoooooore Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEw.desc=The Titanium Large Boiler is a distant cousin to the Bronze and Steel Boilers, and it has a significant difference. Instead of accepting just about any burnable fuel, it will only accept specific ones and reject all others. You can see which ones are accepted by looking at the appropriate NEI tab, but the Solid Super Fuels are guaranteed to work.%n%nThis is a big downside, but the upside is that these boilers output respectable power even in these tiers. Without any other inputs, this boiler produces Superheated Steam at a flow rate matching 4000 EU/t, on turbines running at 100%% fuel efficiency. If this becomes 150%%, then the steam output will produce 6000 EU/t, almost the same as a boosted Large Combustion Engine!%n%nTo get all the power from this, though, you will need a HP Steam Turbine, followed by a regular Steam Turbine, or more than one of each if the flow rate is too big for the turbine material you've chosen. Make sure to send the Distilled Water back to the boilers!

# Quest: Even More Steam? Are You Sure?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADFA.name=§6§lEven More Steam? Are You Sure?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADFA.desc=The Large Tungstensteel Boiler is the biggest and baddest of the four. Like the Titanium one, it is a specialized boiler that only accepts specific fuels, mainly the Solid Super Fuels, but it will produce Superheated Steam at a rate equivalent to 16000 EU/t, at 100%% fuel efficiency. If you have good Steam Turbines, especially Oriharukon ones, you will get much more power than that, around 24000 EU/t or more.%n%nDepending on how many of these you build, you might need a huge amount of turbines. To solve that problem, consider going a bit above the optimal flow on each turbine, or even switching to Loose mode, although this is only a good choice if you can match the optimal flow in that mode.

# Quest: Smelt All the Things...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADZg.name=§6§lSmelt All the Things...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADZg.desc=Smelting up to nine items at once sound nice? With a bit of steel you can make a railcraft Steam Oven. 2x2x2%n%nHint: All furnace recipes work just fine, but you cannot use it to make charcoal from wood.

# Quest: Bring Me My Vat of Polyethelyne!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADbA.name=§6§lBring Me My Vat of Polyethelyne!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADbA.desc=Tired of using small cells to process chemicals? Build a Large Chemical Reactor and you can just pipe in and out fluids. Or use the glorious large fluid cells to deliver and remove fluids from the hatches. %n%nYou can decide if the reactor should void any extra products when the outputs are full or not by toggling the void mode in the GUI!%n%nThere are also recipes specific to only the LCR, sometimes even allowing you to skip a step, so keep you eyes open for that.%n%nAdditionally, as a multiblock, LCR also counts as a cleanroom for any cleanroom recipes.%n%nYou will also need:%n1 Maintenance Hatch%n1-2 Energy Hatches%n0+ Input Bus (if a recipe has an item input. For full automation, you should probably use 1 for each material)%n0-1 Output Bus (if a recipe has an item output)%n2+ Input Hatch (use 1 for every fluid)%n1+ Output Hatch (same as above)%n%nYou can use a screwdriver on an output hatch to cycle through its modes. Use shift-right click to go directly to specific fluid mode, then lock the fluid with a cell for easier automation. This works on more than just the LCR.

# Quest: Cleanroom
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADrA.name=§6§lCleanroom
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADrA.desc=If you want to make more advanced (also cheaper!) circuits you'll need a cleanroom. The cleanroom is a multiblock between 3x4x3 and 15x15x15 (WxHxL) blocks. The base does not need to be a square, a rectangular shape is fine if it is symmetric around the center. Besides plascrete blocks for all edges you'll need a controller in the top center,fFilter machine casings for the rest of the top except edges, an energy and a maintenance hatch. You will also need a reinforced door or some other way to get in and out and machine hulls or diodes if you want to automate it. The door, machine hulls, and diodes are optional. You can use the machine hulls for power input, item input, and item output. Tier does not affect item transfer, so use the cheapest ones for that.%n%nLet's build a 5x5x5 room. Expanding it vertically is easy to do, or you can make it wider and longer, as long as both X and Z match and are odd. Up to around 5%% of the plascrete blocks can be replaced with Reinforced Glass to see into the cleanroom and check on machines. Some other glass like Borosilicate Glass or Warded Glass can be used in even higher percentages.%n%nYou can pass materials through the walls using Machine Hulls. You can pass 1A of power using a Machine Hull as well, or you can use Diodes to pass multiple amps through.%n%nJust be really careful when upgrading your machines to a higher voltage. Be sure to remove the machine hulls and diodes and replace them with the new power tier, or else you will be very sad. You don't need to do this for ones you only use to pass items through.%n%nIf the Cleanroom has maintenance issues, it will have a chance to void recipes needing a cleanroom (10%% per maint issue!). Monitor your cleanroom with a Hand Scanner, Industrial Information Panel, or using a Needs Maintenance Cover and a Redstone Powered Light or Howler Alarm.%n%nAdditionally, the longer the door is open or the cleanroom is off, the lower the efficiency will get, which has a direct correlation to recipe voiding. So open the door as little as possible and keep the cleanroom running! There are ways around using a door though. With an elevator or travel anchor you never actually need to open a door or even use one in the structure! You can even use the elevator block or travel anchor as a floor block to neatly integrate it.%n%nThe power usage of this multiblock is a bit unusual. It starts out at 40 eu/t and then gradually goes down. But even when it uses 40 eu/t - which is usually MV - a single LV energy hatch suffices. Just keep in mind that this makes the Cleanroom an exception, not the rule.%n%n§3Multiblocks such as the LCR, LPF, or PA count as cleanrooms, so you don't need to put them in one. You cannot use the bio lab in a PA, so you'll still need the cleanroom later on.%n%nOther helpful hints include: using a wireless connector for AE or a transvector interface to skip machine hulls, and that you can use higher tier energy hatches to reach 100%% efficiency faster (does not use more power once at 100%%).%n%n§4Keep in mind that you cannot use anything in the cleanroom that causes pollution or it will break down.

# Quest: A Very Useful Scanner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADrQ.name=§6§lA Very Useful Scanner
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADrQ.desc=The portable scanner is a tool capable of showing advanced information about almost every block in the game. In order to function, the tool needs to be charged first. It can hold up to 400k EU and accept 128 EU/t or less. This is MV tier.%n%nIt can scan crops by right clicking it to fully scan it, unlike a cropnalyzer which needs a seed bag in your inventory, and takes multiple goes. Crops that were scanned in the world will drop a scanned seed bag.%n%nIt can scan machines from GregTech, giving information about current progress, the stored energy, efficiency, problems and CPU-load - be sure to check the full chat window for additional details.%n%nFor any block in the game it scans, it gives information about its ID, Metadata, position in the world and hardness value. It also gives information about pollution level in the chunk the scanned block belongs to.%n%nIn addition it shows when the cleanroom has reached its 100 percent efficiency level.

# Quest: The 'Water Problems' Are Solved

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADug.desc=After entering the HV age you've found a way of making a water reservoir which solves the finite water problem. Craft it with some fused quartz glass, HV pumps, and cauldrons.

# Quest: EBF Info
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEmw.name=§6§lEBF Info
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEmw.desc=You can use a scanner to manually check how your EBF works, or you can make an information panel from nuclear control and always see the status. Make a GT sensor kit and use it on the EBF controller. Place the the sensor card in your info panel. Enable it with a redstone signal.%n%nThe GregTech sensor card can monitor GregTech machines like the EBF, Turbines, and Pyrolyse ovens. This is handy for keeping an eye on maintenance issues for multiblocks.%n%nIf you want to put the panels far from the machines they are monitoring, you will need range upgrades.%n%n§3There's also a more advanced version.

# Quest: Assembling Line
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFhA.name=§6§lAssembling Line
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFhA.desc=The Assembling Line (or 'Assline') is an important machine for high tier components in LuV tier and above for making Motors, Pistons, Robot Arms, Pumps and many more.%n%nThe multiblock can be 5-16 blocks long. The minimum length required depends on the number of components and fluids required by the recipe it's crafting. A length of 11 blocks will fit 80 percent of all recipes in GTNH.%n%nThe bottom layer must have on one outer side all the Input Hatches for fluids (4), in the bottom middle layer Input Busses for items (10), and on the end 1 Output Bus. Also on the bottom outer layer must be one Maintainance Hatch. The rest is Solid Steel Machine Casings.%n%nThe second layer on the outer sides left and right are Reinforced Glass and in the middle center Assembling Line Casing.%n%nThe third layer has on the left and right Grate Machine Casings and in the middle Assembler Machine Casings (Note the name change!). The Assembling Line control block and Data Access Hatch are on the opposite edge from the Input Hatches - not at the end with the Output Bus.%n%nThe fourth layer is a single line of Solid Steel Machine Casings in the middle (11), with two Energy Hatches for power. Once you have it built, you can replace the two IV energy hatches with 1 LuV energy hatch.%n%nAutomating the assline is a difficult challenge! You can used advanced tooles like SFM or OpenComputers, but maybe you can figure out how to do it with Enderio or just AE2.%n%nFor more details on using the Assembly Line, check out the wiki page §9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Assembly_Line[/url]§r%n%n§3BTW the input busses are ULV to help with your automating, if you don't want to automate it, you can use higher tier ones, unlike the CAL.%n%nYou can have up to 16 input busses. If you use the full 16 you should put the output bus to the side.

# Quest: Time to Drill For Ore!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGCQ.name=§6§lTime to Drill For Ore!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGCQ.desc=Auto Miners are nice but you're going to reach a point where you will want MOOOOOOOOOOOOORE ores. This multiblock will help with that.  It will also pre-macerate your ores and give you a little bonus crushed ores as well.%n%nHigher tiers of power will drill faster. You need to upgrade the energy hatch corresponding to the power tier. You will also need an energy hatch, an input hatch, and an output bus - at least MV but you can choose.%n%nLater you can upgrade the ore drilling plant so it extracts from more than a 48 block radius. If you don't want to mine that far away, adjust the range with a screwdriver. Each tier of the controller also gives 1 bonus fortune for small ores starting at 4. At tier 3 you'll want to spread the wealth to multiple compressed chests!%n%nThe multiblock miners have been upgraded so that they will chunkload the area they dig in. They will NOT chunkload themselves however. They will dig §odown§r in the chunk they're in like normal, and then dig §oup§r one chunk at a time in other chunks within its range.%n%nYou need mining pipes in the controller and drilling fluid in the fluid hatch. You can also feed mining pipes into an input bus.%n%nYou'll need to make lots of Drilling Fluid. 64 is a tiny amount to get started with! Plan to make thousands of buckets - perhaps onsite, or pumped in via Long Distance Fluid Pipes.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain (and meteors!) on any side. And set a waypoint with JourneyMap so you don't forget where you placed it!

# Quest: Data Access Hatches
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG-w.name=§6§lData Access Hatches
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG-w.desc=So, if you want to do more than one recipe in your Assline, you want a Data Access Hatch. There are 3+1 versions.%n%nData Access Hatch: It holds 4 data sticks, so 4 recipes.%n%nAdvanced Data Access Hatch: It holds 16 data sticks. Ironically, you can make this right away.%n%nAutomatable Data Access Hatch: It's UV, but it allows I/O of the sticks. Skip it.%n%nThe Data Bank Multi: Can be connected to multiple Asslines, and can contain more than 1 DAH. This is the best way, when you can do it.

# Quest: Grinding With Wind
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHKA.name=§6§lGrinding With Wind
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHKA.desc=The Windmill is a grinder that uses the force of wind to macerate Items and Blocks. You will only get one crushed Ore from it sometimes. However it does give a bonus when you try to macerate other things. That bonus depends on the item inserted, for example Netherrack has a chance to give two instead of one dust and Wheat will always give one and a quarter flour.%n%nThe dispensers replace a clay block in the walls. Put anything you like in the interior - a bed, stairs, torches, etc.%n%nNormal multiblock rules apply - do not cross chunk boundaries with this multiblock.%n%nIf this is your first GregTech multiblock, as with all the rest you will need to whack the controller with a soft mallet to activate it.%n%nIf you have troubles forming the multiblock, try breaking and replacing the controller block.%n%nThe controller can be fed items via hoppers etc to allow for larger batches. Just don't allow the dispenser to fill up or it will void outputs.%n%nThe rotor blades will run if the controller is disabled or has no recipe. Remove the blades when not in use or else they'll be used up.%n%nSpeed and output will be affected by wind speed, recipe, and rotor.%n%nMacerates 16 items at a time.%n%nHigh wind speeds will decrease output.%n%nThe durability will decrease according to the wind speed.

# Quest: Awakened Draconium Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHKQ.name=§6§lAwakened Draconium Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHKQ.desc=To process the most advanced materials like Infinity Catalyst or Infinity you need more than 9900K.

# Quest: Helium is Not Just for Balloons
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHcA.name=§6§lHelium is Not Just for Balloons
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHcA.desc=Higher tier superconducting wires and energy hatches will require helium. Compressing air and liquifying it requires 1802 compressed air cells to get 1 He cell. It's probably better to get it from end stone dust or monazite from the Moon. Another option is to have a look at your oil processing and see how you can get Helium from there.%n%n§3PS: If you've progressed far enough in the TF, you can also chip off parts of the snow queen's lair. She won't mind, right?

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIFQ.desc=Once you build your vacuum freezer, you're going to have to carry around hot ingots all the time (assuming you don't automate it). Your old gloves are falling apart, and take up both hands. I think there's a way to glue them together so you can carry hot items with just one hand. Give me some parts and I'll do it for you.%n%n§3PS: The particle effect is active all the time, so if you don't like that, don't do this quest or don't wear them.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAQ.desc=The Bacterial Vat is a unique multiblock machine with its own recipes. But it also has advanced versions of many brewery recipes.%n%nThe Vat isn't mandatory in this tier, but there are many useful recipes and you'll need it later on, so let's build one!%n%nAll recipes require a §cculture§r, some recipes require a specific §cGlass-Tier.%n%n§rThe culture is made in a BioLab and §lput in the controller.%n%n§l§rThe Glass-Tier is calculated as LV = Tier 1, so this quest requires you to make tier 3 glass.

# Quest: Sievert for the Vat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAw.name=§6§lSievert for the Vat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAw.desc=Some Vat recipes require a certain Sievert (radioactivity) value. So attach this Radio Hatch to your Vat to input radioactive material!%n%nThe Radio Hatch holds rods/long rods of radioactive material and uses them to produce Sievert. The input item determines the Sievert value and how long it lasts. Items stored in the hatch will be used continuously even if machine not active, so make sure you want to craft something before putting items in.%n%n§rYou can check the stats of an inputted item with a portable scanner. Higher tiers of hatch hold more, from 1kg (HV) to 6kg (UV). Rods are worth 1kg, while long rods are 2kg.%n%nSome recipes require §4exact§r sievert, you can use the screwdriver to access the radiation shutter control to adjust how much sv is blocked from being sent to the vat. For example, you need 100sv to make SeaweedBroth, so you'd use Naquadah rods, and block off 30sv.%n%nRod Stats:%nMaterial-Sievert-Apprx. time until used up%nBismuth                 83sv   198s%nUranium 235           92sv    80s%nUranium 238           92sv    80s%nPlutonium 239         94sv    66s%nPlutonium 241         94sv    66s%nNaquadah             130sv   14.5s%nEnriched Naquadah 140sv   10.5s%nNaquadria            150sv     8s%n%nThere are more radioactive materials than these, but these are the main ones.

# Quest: Making the Vat More Efficient!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKBA.name=§6§lMaking the Vat More Efficient!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKBA.desc=Looking at the Vat's recipes you are likely discouraged by the small amount of fluid being produced per recipe. Don't worry! Fluid consumption and production shown in NEI are just the baseline for the lowest efficiency. The efficiency of Vat depends on the amount of fluid in the Output Hatch.%n%nThe efficiency gradually increases as the output hatch fills up and reaches maximum efficiency when it is §cexactly half-filled§r. If the hatch fills even more, the efficiency goes down again, so try to keep it close to half! At maximum efficiency the amount of fluid consumed and produced per recipe is multiplied by 1001. The items and culture are not affected.%n%nThere are different means to keep it at half, including OC (not SFM, it doesn't like BW fluids), fluid detector+machine controller, or a fluid regulator, as well as more off the wall ones such as frames or block-sharing. If you choose the fluid detector route, remember that using a larger output hatch will make it easier to keep it close to half-filled.

# Quest: Circuit Assembly Line
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKKQ.name=§c§l§6§e§6§lCircuit Assembly Line
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKKQ.desc=You'll need all of this to create 4 CALs, enough for a single series of circuits. If you only want one (for the microprocessors for example), just divide by 4.%n%nAssuming you got the necessary imprints on the LuV tab, you can now craft the CALs for the crystalprocessor series. We're starting with 4 since you'll need one per circuit, the imprint is not removable. And yes this means you need one for every circuit type you want to make with the CAL.%n%nAs an Assembly Line, it generally works like the normal one, with different items in each bus, but since it's only one item per CAL, it's far easier to use, and the recipe is cheaper too.%n%nThe CAL uses 'wraps' to make 16 of a circuit at a time (aside from ULV and LV circuits), saving you time, EU, and Soldering Alloy (or Indalloy). You make the wraps in an Assembler with 16 of the item and Polyethylene.%n%n§3BTW you can change out the Hatches and Busses for better ones, but you still need to keep ingredient order. Also CAL grants perfect overclock.

# Quest: Something From Nothing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKbA.name=§6§lSomething From Nothing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKbA.desc=Void Miners are basically the same thing as regular ones, except that they draw from the whole pool of ores for the dimension without there having to be any nearby. In addition, you can speed them up by supplying Neon, Krypton, Xenon, or Oganesson.%n%nYou can get Neon reasonably easily from Bartimaeusnek Ore from Ross 128ba. Krypton and Xenon can be produced from centrifuging fuel rods. All three can be produced from the EV liquid air distillation method. Remember you need the Liquid Air Fluid Hatch to actually put in enough liquid air. If you want all the produced gasses from the first 4 slots, you'll need to use the Giant Output Hatch.%n%nTo get Oganesson, you'll need mk3 fusion.%n%nAll four fluids can be replicated, so you'll probably end up doing that.%n%n§3If you want the Deep Dark's ores, you HAVE to use a Void Miner.

# Quest: I Put a Machine Into Your Machine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKyw.name=§6§lI Put a Machine Into Your Machine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKyw.desc=Effectively lets you parallel like crazy if you can afford the power. 1 EV hatch can supply all 64 possible machines if they're LV. You can also separate busses with a screwdriver. The PA is usually less efficient than a dedicated multiblock but it is very versatile and allows for TecTech energy hatches and even laser hatches once you get there.%n%n§3Doesn't work with some machines, like mass fabs.%n%nJust in case you get that far and still remember it: The PA maxes out at UHV recipes. But UEV machines are treated as 4x UHV machines giving you a lot of parallels.%n%nThere is also a new experimental feature where the PA can handle fluid recipes without cells but using the fluid directly.

# Quest: TFFT

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKzQ.desc=The TFFT is very useful if you don't want to have a bunch of Super Tanks, it also has a modular structure so it can be up to x4.33 times bigger than numbers in this quest.%n%nWith the tier I storage field block, it consumes 27 EU/t but only has about 0.27x the storage capacity of a ST I per fluid.%n%nWith the tier V storage field block it consumes 1134 EU/t and has about 0.54x the storage capacity of a QT III per fluid.%n%nWith the tier X storage field block it consumes 0EU/t (only tier X uses 0) and has about x3.3 capacity of T7 YOTTank (divide by 25 to get per 1 fluid)%n%nYou can use the multi hatch to access all the fluids at once with an ME Fluid Storage Bus or Fluid Ender Conduit.%n%n§3Remember to turn auto-voiding on if you need it

# Quest: Advanced MB Construction
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALKA.name=§6§lAdvanced MB Construction
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALKA.desc=The ability to rotate MBs and view a structure hologram has been sto-§oborrowed§r from §9Tec§1Tech§r, giving you greater freedom to build the way you want! §5(until we nerf wallsharing at least)§r%n%nUnlike TT, you can use a normal wrench for this, just aim at the front center of a controller (or one of the other sides if you want to. You just need to aim for the part of the grid with the mark) and right click or shift-right-click. The first rotates it clockwise, the latter flips it. If you want to change the facing of the controller itself, do that the normal way.%n%nUse a Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector or MSHP to visualize the structure, pay attention to the bottom left for structure details. For multiblocks that accept multiple types of tiered components or have a variable size, the number of MSHPs you hold in your hand will decide which tier is shown in the hologram.%n%n§3If you don't get it, try placing a controller, wrenching it, and using the MSHP on it.§r%n%nWhile it's now possible to build a sideways EBF, or even build one into the floor, not everything can be rotated. Exceptions include: LSC, Charcoal Pile Igniter, BBF, DT, Miners, Industial Washing Plant, Algae Farm, Bacterial Vat, DEHP, the MVF can, but the MBF cannot.%n%n§3PS: We did get permission, that was just a little joke.

# Quest: HSS-S Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALTA.name=§6§lHSS-S Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALTA.desc=Technically this coil tier can be skipped. But you need LuV to get the next one, so you should really get these coils for now.%n%n%nTo process more advanced materials like LuV Superconductor Base you need more than 5400K. Time to upgrade your EBF to 6300k.

# Quest: Trinium Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALTQ.name=§6§lTrinium Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALTQ.desc=To process more advanced materials like neutronium or fluxed electrum you need more than 8100K. Upgrade your EBF to 9001k. (OVER 9000!!!)

# Quest: Neutron Activator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALeA.name=§6§lNeutron Activator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALeA.desc=You will need machine to process the naquadah in future.%n%nThis machine is different from most mulits. It needs to use §4Neutron Accelerator§r this special hatch instead of energy hatch to keep it running.%n%nThe accelerator will increase its Neutron Kinetic Energy (NKE) and when the NKE is between the requested number which you can see in NEI, the machine will work and output the right products. However, if you turn on the Neutron Activator when NKE doesn't meet the requirement, it will still consume your input material but output trash. So be careful with the NKE when you run this machine.%n%nWhen all Neutron Accelerator§rs aren't running, NKE will decrease 72keV/s.%n%nNeutron Activator will explode when NKE is over 1200MeV.%n%n§3The more height/speed casings you have, the more inefficient the eu->eV conversion becomes, so you then need more power. The maths is as follows: Multiply recipe time by 0.9 for each height above 4 and multiply eV you get from your input power by 0.95 for each height above 4.

# Quest: Neutron Sensor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALeQ.name=§6§lNeutron Sensor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALeQ.desc=The sensor will sends redstone signals according to the NKE of the Neutron Activator.%n%nYou only need to input some expressions like ">120MeV", "<=1000keV" etc in the sensor, and it will work as you want.

# Quest: Neutron Accelerator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALeg.name=§6§lNeutron Accelerator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALeg.desc=It is used to accelerate the NKE. You just need to connect a cable to it and it will keep consuming the energy.%n%n§3PS: You can use a controller cover to stop it.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALpQ.desc=Electric Air Filter%n%nThis wonderful multiblock comes in 3 versions:§9 §rT1 for LV, T2 for late HV and T3 for IV.%n%n§r§9§rIt has 2 modes:%n%n§9§r- a normal mode, where one chunk is processed at a time in the working area, in order, per pollution cleaning cycle.%n- a random mode, where the chunk being cleaned is picked randomly between all the polluted chunks in the working area.%n§r%nTo cycle between the modes, right click on the controller with a screwdriver.%n%n§9§rThe controller can change its working area from 1x1 to (2*tier+1) x (2*tier+1) chunks. To do that, right click with a screwdriver on the controller while sneaking. The default size is the maximum working area.%n%n§r§9§rThe pollution removal calculation is equals (by default) to 30 * bonusMultiTier * Muffler Hatches * Turbine Eff * Multiblock Eff * 2.5 ^ Effective Tier where:%n%n- BonusMultiTier is a boost given by the multiblock tier. T1 is 1 (0%%), T2 is 1.05 (5%%) and T3 is 1.10 (10%%)%n%n- Muffler Hatches is the amount of muffler hatches on the multiblock (up to 8)%n%n- Turbine Eff is the efficiency of the turbine chosen to run the multi. It won't run if there is no turbine in the controller.%n%n- Multiblock Eff is the efficiency of the multiblock (100%% when no maintenance issue, -10%% per issue)%n%n- Effective Tier is the Effective Tier of the multi: the minimum tier between the electric tier of the multi and the tier of the muffler hatches%n%n§rThe pollution cleaning is boosted by two (by default) when using an Absorption Filter. When added in the input bus, it will be consumed and used for 30 (by default) successful pollution cleaning cycle. If a chunk with no pollution in it is processed, that doesn't count as successful, and the multi decides that a chunk has no pollution if the pollution is below 10k gibbl (by default). After the 30th successful pollution cleaning cycle, the output bus will give a Dirty Absorption Filter.%n%nTo know if an Absorption Filter is present and how many remaining cycles there are, use an portable scanner on the controller.%n%n§9§rA pollution cycle lasts 10s, and the cleaning is done every second.

# Quest: Absorption Filter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALpg.name=§6§lAbsorption Filter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALpg.desc=When you reach MV tier you can make your own Absorption Filter for the Air Filter to clean pollution much more efficient. The Filter will be consumed and you get a dirty Filter back after 30 Cycles.

# Quest: You Are Not Prepared... But They Are
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqQ.name=§6§6§a§9§8§7§6§5§4§3§2§1§0§3§f§k§f§l§6§lYou Are Not Prepared... But They Are
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqQ.desc=Building a smeltery from ground up can be really tedious and time consuming. How about go borrow one from the locals? They will surely be happy to share it with an unfriendly adventurer that just dismantled their bricked railway station.%n%nThe villagers are so dumb that they spent all their seared bricks without adding a few key components like faucets or drains. You still need to craft some smeltery bricks yourselves... %n%nTotally not useful tip: if you hold off building this long enough, you will be able to break down seared brick blocks into seared brick items with a forge hammer or extractor.%n%n§3Unfortunately, going down this path means we will not give you quest rewards, since you are already getting this important multiblock for free. Check the checkbox to signify your consent.

# Quest: Expert MB-Construction
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1g.name=§6§lExpert MB-Construction
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1g.desc=Right click the controller while sneaking will invoke an action called §osurvival autoplace§r. This will attempt to build the multiblock with items from your inventory, provided the area this multi occupies is clear of obstacles. Again, like hologram spawning, multiblocks that accept multiple types of tiered components or has variable length, the number of MSHPs you hold in hand will decide which tier of blocks will be placed. It will place correct amount of hatches for you, but will usually orient the hatches towards you, not perpendicular to the surface. It will just place casings for you if you don't have any hatches in inventory, unless this spot require the use of a hatch (e.g. the top center spot of EBF).%n%nSurvival autoplace can also take from your alternative inventories, or items that contain/link to an inventory. Currently, this includes: %n- adventure backpacks, either worn or as an item in inventory%n- AE2 portable cells%n- ME network linked by any kind of AE2 wireless terminal that support item access. support view cell filtering, consume power, require security access and within wireless range%n- Forestry backpacks%n- ender chest inventory, if you have the Ender Backpack from Backpacks mod. Note: ordinary backpacks from the Backpacks mod are NOT supported at the moment.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1w.desc=It's time for something really big: A smeltery! There's a lot to craft, so better gather some resources... or you could go try complete this with the help of some unhappy NPC friends, but that would void your quest rewards.%n%n§3Note: This quest is mutually exclusive with the other smeltery quest.

# Quest: Getting Muddy With Monazite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL4Q.name=§6§lGetting Muddy With Monazite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL4Q.desc=Pretty soon you're going to need lanthanide elements. A lot of them. %nThey're not that easy to separate, however...%n%nCraft up a Digester to unlock the questline in the IV tab.%n%nNote: This multiblock will not function correctly without a muffler hatch

# Quest: Dissolution Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL4g.name=§6§lDissolution Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL4g.desc=Basically a mixing machine purposely made for dilution.%n%nYou'll need to take care in providing the inputs at the required ratios, else you'll get no output.%n%nAnyway, this plays a large part in the lanthanide line so craft it up.

# Quest: Your New Friend
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEQ.name=§6§lYour New Friend
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEQ.desc=It's painful to carry all the tools in your inventory. You can put GT tools and soldering into IC2 Toolbox to save space for inventory.%n%nYou can also use it to do maintenance, without taking out tools. Just hold toolbox and right click the Maintenance Hatch. Now who needs ducttape? You. It is needed to to automate maintenance later.

# Quest: Precise Assembler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEg.name=§6§lPrecise Assembler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEg.desc=Precise Assembler has two modes: Precise mode and Normal mode.%n%nPrecise mode is used to make some of the advanced components from Good Generator mod.%n%nNormal mode works as multiblock version of Assembler.%n%n§3You can't skip tiers with this. You need singleblock Assembler or GT++ multi to make your first Energy Hatch, then you can use it for Precise Assembler.

# Quest: Another Chemical Multiblock?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMig.name=§6§lAnother Chemical Multiblock?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMig.desc=You probably have built a lot of Large Chemical Reactors by now. With the powerful 4/4 overclocking it is one of the strongest multiblocks there is. But what if even that is not enough to satisfy your chemical needs? You can't make it faster if the recipe time is already down to 1 tick (=0.05s).%n%nFear not, we have a solution for you: The Mega Chemical Reactor. It lets you do 256 parallels for your LCR recipes! And you can still overclock after that if you provide enough power.%n%nIt only unlocks in LuV as it needs 7 Fusion Coil Blocks. Check with your hologram projector to see how it is built and what you need.%n%nThe glass tier limits the energy hatch tier that you can use. You can even use multiamp hatches from TecTech! If you want to use laser hatches however you need at least UV glass.

# Quest: Infinity Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkQ.name=§6§lInfinity Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkQ.desc=Smelting with the ferocity of the universe itself.%n%nThis unbelievable material seemed impossible to manipulate into a coil block form, even though its properties made this desirable. It is incredibly stable even at extreme temperatures, but this also made it unable to pack together for coils.%n%nHowever, the situation changed when you thought about using something more intelligent. By integrating a Wetware or better UHV circuit, the Infinity Coil became a reality, controlled by the ever-watching eyes of the circuitry you've spent months to create. From now on, these eyes will watch over your multiblocks.%n%nProvides 11701 heat. You could upgrade your EBF, though at this point it's more likely to be for your MEBFs or your DTPF.

# Quest: Advanced Assembly Line
betterquesting.quest.ZIotzqvnRiKu1_1Hb9i1dg.name=Advanced Assembly Line
betterquesting.quest.ZIotzqvnRiKu1_1Hb9i1dg.desc=This is the advanced assembly line from §6GigaGram§rFab.%n%nIt supports item pipelining. That is, it will mimic a real assembly line by consuming ingredients one by one instead of all at start. In effect, it offers a parallelism up to however many item input this recipe requires. You can think of an advanced assembly line as a collection of assembly slices. Each assembly slice is capably of processing each step independent of other slices. It will start processing once the input bus contents align with any stored data stick. The first slice will consume the input in Bus #1. After (recipe time/number of inputs) time, the first slice's work is concluded and will start the second slice. At the same time, first slice will look for input in input bus #1. If there are still enough input there slice #1 will start working again.%n%nThe terminal slice (the n-th slice, where n is number of item input in recipe) will put the recipe output in output bus when it has concluded his work. Whenever a non-terminal slice finished its work, it will try to pass the work onto next slice. If the next slice cannot find the materials in its input bus, the just-finished slice will remain in §4STUCK§r state and hang the assembly line. To help locate these §4STUCK§r assembly lines, the controller's front face will have its status light turned orange.%n%nThe EU/t cost of this machine is number of slices active multiplied by the original recipe EU/t. §4STUCK§r slices do not consume power. It will use the worst energy supplying hatch's input voltage for recipe tier calculation and normal imperfect overclock. With exotic energy hatches, it can overclock beyond usual voltage tier, but will consume even more power than usual imperfect overclock. Every §2laser overclock§r will 0.3 to power exponent. 1 §2laser overclock§r will have 50%% recipe time and use 430%% power. 2 §2laser overclocks§r will have 25%% recipe time and use 1978%% power. Will not overclock beyond 1 tick. Machine first tries to parallelize, then normal imperfect overclock, then §2laser overclock§r.

# Quest: Don't Lose That Multiblock Miner!
betterquesting.quest.b_Ll4zvSRfCMgmqiBa4Xkw.name=Don't Lose That Multiblock Miner!
betterquesting.quest.b_Ll4zvSRfCMgmqiBa4Xkw.desc=It's easy to lose Ore Drilling Plants. You're a busy engineer, you know? You can't be bothered to remember trifling things like "where, in what galactic backwater I last placed my miner." Now, you could do something boring like "write down the location of the miner" or "put up a sign with the miner's location in my ore processing area," but there's a better way.%n%nEnter the Metrics Transmitter Cover. This cover, when attached to a multiblock miner (or any GregTech machine,) spawns in a GregTech Advanced Sensor Card paired to the host machine. This card, when inserted into a NuclearCraft Industrial Information Panel, will receive runtime information transmitted by the host machine, including its current location. Additionally, it returns the same information that its lower-tech sibling, the GregTech Sensor Kit, provides. Unlike the GregTech Senor Kit, the Metrics Transmitter Cover §nworks interdimensionally and at any range without the need of range upgrades.§r In addition, since covers remain on machines when they are dismantled, the paired sensor card §nwill continue to work even if the host machine is relocated, and never needs to be recalibrated.§r This makes it perfect for the Ore Drilling Plant and Oil/Gas/Fluid Drilling Rig, which are deployed in the field and often have to be relocated.%n%nHowever, like always, there's a catch. If the Metrics Transmitter Cover is detached from its host machine, §nthe paired sensor card will be destroyed.§r Maybe you shouldn't be using a crowbar around sensitive electronics...


## Quest Line: GT++ 
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQ.name=GT++ 
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQ.desc=GT++ adds new functionality to GT, including high speed multiblocks.

# Quest: This is your Kryptonite!
betterquesting.quest.pLCgOVmqTUCudSXZusnceg.name=This is your Kryptonite!
betterquesting.quest.pLCgOVmqTUCudSXZusnceg.desc=Here's the special Titanium I promised you. GT++ materials enter the fray here, both with this and the Titansteel you need to add to that to make what comes next!%n%nThat step only comes after fusing Niobium and Zinc into Krypton Plasma. You get a rarer noble gas here than before, the next one will be Xenon. This recipe matches in speed with the next one, which uses Krypton to make Astral Titanium Plasma, by adding in the final plasma of the previous chain, Force Plasma! That's right, each chain needs everything from before to continue. %n%nOnce you have Astral Titanium Plasma, you can move on to the final mk2 step.

# Quest: Force Plasma - The Mk1 Ending
betterquesting.quest.tSCw6KSbR8a4TCNWlrmkYQ.name=Force Plasma - The Mk1 Ending
betterquesting.quest.tSCw6KSbR8a4TCNWlrmkYQ.desc=Once you have the two plasmas from before, fuse them together into a new one, Neon Plasma. If you were to use this directly, you could get Neon! There are other, more useful materials to get later in this process, so keep a lookout for those.%n%nHowever, this is not the final plasma in mk1 recipes. To get it, you need to do the last activation step, which exists in all three chains, and involves adding a non-plasma related material, of the appropriate GT tier, to obtain the powergen plasma. The material you need here is Bedrockium, one you probably have used before. The early game, Compressed Cobblestone method of getting it is a huge burden, so switch to t8 Void Miners or the Space Elevator to automate this.%n%nIf you look at the last recipe, you'll see it's 144L Neon Plasma input to 1000L Force Plasma output. This multiplying makes it so that step, and all final steps, are the slowest ones. You will need 0.144 Neon Plasma reactors for every Force Plasma reactor, which means that 1 Neon reactor feeds nearly 7 Force reactors (6.9444... reactors, more precisely).%n%nOnce you get Force Plasma, this is the end of the mk1 fusion chain. Force Plasma is a 150M fuel value plasma, which means it has a 53.5%% penalty with Infinity Catalyst in XL Plasma Generators. This is better than Helium Plasma with its 86.1%% penalty but still not great for power generation. You probably don't need this in ZPM, but it'll be a stepping stone for your future progression.

# Quest: GT++ Multiblocks
betterquesting.quest.w5O5rPL_Q_GDp8lxWMd0DQ.name=GT++ Multiblocks
betterquesting.quest.w5O5rPL_Q_GDp8lxWMd0DQ.desc=You might already have a Steam Multiblock or the Large Sifter. But in EV, IV, and the following tiers you unlock GT++ multiblocks for (almost) every GT machine. And some more on top of that!%n%nMost of them are made to do the same GT processing as the singleblock machines you've been using, but much faster. The multis can have up to three bonuses: energy savings, faster recipe time and parallels, which mean that a single recipe cycle can craft multiple items at once, if the power provided is enough to sustain it.%n%nThe variety of structures and intricacies of GT++ multi can go far beyond simpler multis like the EBF, LCR or VF. While some are simple cuboids, others come with more diverse mechanics and conditions to work properly. In return, they can be extremely powerful, so keep an eye out for them!

# Quest: Marie Curium?
betterquesting.quest.3r7tJ7_bTuePzsh-B_jyIQ.name=Marie Curium?
betterquesting.quest.3r7tJ7_bTuePzsh-B_jyIQ.desc=It's like cured meat... no, not at all, many sacrifices were made on the path to understanding radioactivity, may they be remembered forever. This goes to you, Marie and Pierre Curie.%n%nThis is the only non-plasma produced in a fusion reaction in this entire chain. That's not the important part, though: the important part is that §4this is one of the bottlenecks of the chain.§r For every reactor running the final recipe, you will need around 0.144 reactors of this, so you won't make it to a compact at the end with just one mk1 reactor. Expect to follow the count of the second-to-last recipe, the Advanced Nitinol one.

# Quest: Calcium Bottlenecking
betterquesting.quest.9j1Iwd3KRG6jqLI9m6YDKQ.name=Calcium Bottlenecking
betterquesting.quest.9j1Iwd3KRG6jqLI9m6YDKQ.desc=Craft yourself some bone-strengthening Calcium in plasma form.%n%nThis step is almost twice as fast as the Boron one, so you only need half the reactors, plus one, or the tier above the reactors on the Boron side. It would normally be a lot slower, but the next step needs only a small amount of Calcium.%n%nKeep in mind that, at the end of each of the three fusion chains, the plasma amount gets multiplied, which means that most of your bottlenecks will be near the end of the entire setup, if you're going for Celestial Tungsten Plasma.%n%nYou will need 2.13 reactors with this recipe to feed 1 reactor with the next step.

It is the ultimate metallurgical furnace to make your alloys with up to 256 parallels. If you pay very close attention you might even notice the almost imperceptable speed bonus from using expensive coils.%n%nThe glass tier limits both the energy hatch tier and the recipe tier. As with other multis, UEV glass unlocks all tiers and UV glass is needed for lasers.

# Quest: Chemical Pseudo-Altercations
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM1w.name=Chemical Pseudo-Altercations
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM1w.desc=Learning more about the world and its ways is a sign of wisdom. However, the truly wise are the ones who know what is unimportant and can be skipped. For a true breacher of technology, the constraints of physics and chemistry are not essential. To skip past their technicalities, the Quantum Force Transformer comes into play.%n%nThis multi is meant to replicate the most popular and important processing lines in the pack’s progression, mostly those related to chemistry. Because of recursion in recipes, where earlier tier materials are required to craft higher tier equivalents, there are a lot of early processing lines that stay up through progression. Even worse, they often need more and more machines to keep up with increasing speed demands. To save on lag, this multi will do those processing lines in one step and without most of the extra chemicals that are added to purify the inputs into the outputs.%n%nThe Quantum Force Transformer (QFT) is unlocked in UEV, after Optical Mainframes have been crafted, and with the addition of a single Eternal Singularity and other materials. It’s a tall, 15x15 multiblock with many different casings, including two that are upgradable and decide the two tiers of the multi. Although it’s available in UEV, the upgraded casings require more and more expensive materials, while also unlocking skips for more advanced processing lines. For example, a platline skip can be done in the earlier QFT tier, whereas a Kevlar skip can only be done in the last tier.%n%nEach recipe that the QFT has represents a single processing line or a big part of a line. The inputs for the early plastic skip, for example, are the basic components of the plastics on a molecular level (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc.), and not the multi-step chemicals that were used half a dozen tiers earlier. All recipes have 3 or more outputs, and every output has a chance to appear: the chance for each is 100%% divided by the number of outputs. To increase it, there are additional mechanics that can be used.%n%nSimply put, the QFT uses huge amounts of energy and quantum field stabilization to disassemble simple molecules and assemble them into more complex ones, without needing additives or constrained processes. The only addition to the base inputs that the multi requires is a specific catalyst, which the smart circuits use to guide the materials into what they ultimately transform into, but they are never consumed or lost in any way. %n%nThis direct process simplifies long processing chains to one step, but it has two consequences: it makes the process expensive, given the extreme conditions needed to undergo the transformation (in a similar way to fusion), but it also generates many different outputs at once, none of which are guaranteed, and it’s impossible to choose between them without adding something else into the setup to alter the conditions inside the QFT in some way. Throwing more energy into the multi won’t do anything, and better materials don’t seem to work, so what is the next step? That is what the next two quests will answer.%n

# Quest: Focusing Science and Mystery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2A.name=Focusing Science and Mystery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2A.desc=This mechanic is completely optional, and never required for crafting. However, it’s greatly incentivized when the number of parallels is high and when crafting the new items to unlock the new tiers. “Focusing”, in general, means to increase the chances of the outputs in a QFT recipe, and it can be done in two ways, possibly both at the same time. Each method uses a new plasma, both of which are crafted in a T4 Fusion Reactor by using other plasmas as the inputs, including one T3 plasma for each. These plasmas are Neptunium and Fermium and they can be used together, or individually.%n%nWhen Neptunium Plasma is present, the current recipe can have one of its inputs focused. The specific output is chosen with a circuit in the input bus (this is the only thing circuits do for this multi), where circuit 1 is for the 1st output visible in NEI, circuit 2 is for the 2nd output, and so on. It is up to the player to choose which output they want the most out of all the existing ones, and the fact that every recipe has multiple outputs is because of this mechanic.%n%nWhen an output is successfully focused with Neptunium, its chance increases by reducing the chance of all the other outputs. The logic for this change is as follows:%n%n-> Without focusing, the chance of each output is 100 / number of outputs;%n-> If the casing tier matches the recipe tier, the chance of all other outputs is halved and the sum of those halves is added to the focused output (for example, 20/20/20/20/20 becomes 60/10/10/10/10);%n-> If the casing tier is +1 over the recipe tier, halve the other outputs' chance again (for example, 60/10/10/10/10 becomes 80/5/5/5/5);%n-> If the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe tier, set the focused output to 100%% and the rest to 0%%.%n%nIn general, this type of focusing doesn’t increase the total amount of outputs, save for the new items added with this multi that will come out in smaller quantities. Instead, it allows the player to replace less useful outputs with the more useful ones, and this choice is completely up to them, as is the choice of focusing at all.%n%nWhen Fermium Plasma is present, the current recipe will have all of its output chances boosted, unless the chance for one of them is 100%%, in which case that chance is unchanged. This happens because the boost increases if the output chance before ferm focusing is smaller, and the maximum boost is achieved when the chance is 0%%, which happens with high-tier nep focusing.%n%nWhen an output is successfully focused with Fermium, its chance increases based on how far it is from 100%% chance. This applies to all the outputs at once, and the logic for this change is as follows:%n%n-> If the casing tier matches the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/4 of the "failure" chance (for example, a 50%% chance output has a 50%% chance of failure, so it gets boosted by 12.5%%, becoming 62.5%%)%n-> If the casing tier is +1 over the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/3 of the "failure" chance%n-> If the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/2 of the "failure" chance%n%nWith the two plasmas combined and a +2 or +3 over recipe tier, a 5-output recipe would normally have 20/20/20/20/20 chances, but it becomes 100/50/50/50/50.%n%nMany lategame multis have parallels, which means they complete the recipe several times at once every time the recipe time is completed, instead of only one, but they require extra EU to achieve this. This makes power the biggest constraint for those multiblocks, and the same happens with the QFT, given that recipe inputs are generally very cheap and simple. Throwing more power at the machine means more outputs, in general.%n%nGiven that, a player that wants a faster QFT will make more catalysts to unlock more parallels, but each added parallels adds to the other ones, to a cap of 64. Focusing, instead, changes output odds, which effectively multiplies the number of outputs per cycle. In terms of speed, a recipe with 4 outputs and 64 parallels runs at the speed of 256 parallels for the focused output if it’s nep focused to the maximum of 100%%, since it was 25%% originally. %n%nThis is a lot of saved EU for high-tier, high-parallel QFTs, so it is the main reason for focusing, and both plasmas are useful here. However, plasma consumption is not the same regardless of parallels, it instead scales with the square root of the number of correct catalysts for the recipe, which is to say, the number of parallels.%n%nThis further applies to the 3 new items that are needed to upgrade the casing tiers. Since their output amount is much smaller than usual, they could get a further boost if focusing is being used, to incentivize the plasma mechanic when upgrading the multi.

# Quest: Catalyzing Miracles
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2Q.name=Catalyzing Miracles
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2Q.desc=The QFT uses the kind of catalyst that the Chemical Plant also does. However, like the plants that have Awakened Draconium coils or higher, it does not consume the catalyst’s durability on recipe finish, behaving more like a real-life catalyst that is regenerated after being used. This makes the catalysts used here more expensive to craft, as was the case with the Infinite Mutation Catalyst for Mutated Living Solder, which is meant to be used only with those coils that make it last forever.%n%nGiven that there is no durability loss, it would seem only one catalyst needs to be crafted. However, there are two reasons for this to not be true: firstly, each QFT recipe uses a different catalyst; secondly, the QFT checks for parallels by counting the amount of catalysts it has in its input buses for the recipe in question (with a maximum of 64 parallels, for a stack of the correct catalyst). This system makes it so that crafting 1 of the correct type of catalyst is required to unlock a recipe, but making more is completely optional and only changes the speed at which the multi crafts, provided it gets enough EU input.%n%nEvery catalyst needs some of the materials that it unlocks in the QFT, which is to say, the original processing line will have to be used to craft the catalyst that allows the player to skip it in the QFT. This applies to every recipe, and in turn every line that can be skipped.%n%nTo improve the general speed of processing, your one options is to get more parallels with catalysts. The other, more complicated way is to boost the chances of a successful output by adding more energy to the system, but in a special way: instead of using direct EU, using it to create a powerful plasma works to improve the QFT processing.%n%nIf the correct plasmas are added, the boosting will work, but it is also possible to upgrade the structure itself to perform chemistry skips that are not possible with the base QFT. These upgrades rely on more advanced and powerful materials, mainly in the material progression of DTPF recipes. However, those existing materials are not enough, because the quantum stabilization can’t be maintained with those “foreign” substances. Luckily, the QFT itself can produce the items needed to build the upgraded casings, and these items are outputs of some of the skips performed in the multi. It begins by allowing the much simpler production of already-owned materials but, in this process, it unlocks entirely new materials that are useful to improve the structure itself.%n%nThere are three new items and four tiers in the structure. The first tier can be built without them, but every new tier needs a new item crafted in the tier before. These outputs are related to the recipe where they can be obtained, and they possess unique characteristics that, in real life, are only theoretical.%n%nThe first item you will need to craft is the Hyper-Stable Self-Healing Adhesive. To craft this material, proceed with the Glue/Solder recipe by using the Adhesion Promoter Catalyst. Additionally, make these other catalysts to prove you're well set in your QFT journey.%n

# Quest: Tier 2 Transforming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2g.name=Tier 2 Transforming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2g.desc=After a significant amount of progression, you will be able to build the tier 2 QFT by replacing 2 of its casings, the ones on the exterior shell, by the ones listed in this quest. When finished, the multi will be able to perform the monaline skip and a two out of three naqline skips. Amidst all the expensive materials, there is one that can only be crafted in a t1 QFT, so I hope you've got it going.%n%nThe first item - Hyper-Stable Self-Healing Adhesive. This adhesive is very effective at sticking things together, but it is also quantum-stable, which means that it cannot be altered or damaged by simple quantum fields. On top of that, it also has self-healing properties, which means that it can tolerate the increased energy flow of a tier 2, 3 or 4 QFT by repairing itself even when damaged, regardless of how that damage is applied.

# Quest: Tier 3 Focusing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2w.name=Tier 3 Focusing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2w.desc=With access to even better materials, you can upgrade to a t3 QFT. In this tier, two new skips are available: the final naqline skip and the stem cell skip.%n%nThe second item - Superconductor Rare-Earth Composite. This contributes to promoting the flow of energy, instead of stabilizing the structure like the previous item. Given that damage can be automatically repaired, the focus now is to make it easier for the energy to flow from one component to the next and allow for more energy input into the multi. The existing superconductors can’t handle quantum flow well, so this composite can be used instead to remove all resistance to flow across the outer shell of the structure, thanks to the unique composition of the transitions between the rare-earth elements present in the composite. The transition from one to the next is so gradual that the quantum flow has no obstacles or loose ends to escape from.

# Quest: Tier 4 Transforming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM3A.name=Tier 4 Transforming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM3A.desc=The final tier of the QFT, built on many stacks of Spacetime. When it's complete, you will have access to all the skips currently in the game, the new ones being the bio cell skip, the Kevlar skip and the Radox + Xenoxene skip.%n%nThe third item - Black Body Naquadria Supersolid. Even through all the upgrades made beforehand, it’s still not possible to reach the stage of chemical skips for the items that are used to build the first QFT, such as the bioware circuits. This is the theoretical limit of the multi, and reaching this limit needs a material obtained from the second half of the Naquadah line. This new Naquadria-related substance has the characteristics of a black body, a material that absorbs all radiation it receives and reflects none, and is a supersolid, which is to say, a solid that flows like a fluid that has zero viscosity. By applying these qualities together, through a single material, it’s possible to guarantee easy and steady flow of quantum energy at any EU level, even in the MAX tier. With all these advances put together, the QFT is fully unlocked and can create components up to those made in the UHV tier.

# Quest: Runite Plasma - The Mk2 Conclusion
betterquesting.quest.DPl-UUZfTAa-ezdD_m8Huw.name=Runite Plasma - The Mk2 Conclusion
betterquesting.quest.DPl-UUZfTAa-ezdD_m8Huw.desc=To complete this chain, you need to activate the Astral Titanium Plasma you have with a special material, also a GT++ one, called Titansteel. This is a considerable powersink, which is why the input amount is so low at 8L, and it forces you to use 3 ABSs at UV tier to feed one mk2 reactor running the Runite plasma recipe. If you decide to upscale this setup, the best option is to simply build a mega ABS, where you can also use EBF coils to save some EU, and in turn make the powergen chain more efficient.%n%nRunite Plasma has a 350M fuel value, which leaves it free to run on Trinium XLs without penalty, whereas Tin Plasma has a 74.5%% penalty on the same turbines due to having less than half the fuel value. If you want to upscale your plasma powergen to great numbers, this is an option, but the mk3 chain is probably the one to choose.%n%nThe same ratio of 0.144 to 1 reactors also applies here.

# Quest: Algae Pond
betterquesting.quest.Ds_ok-hRS2ODJNs3LUP9kw.name=Algae Pond
betterquesting.quest.Ds_ok-hRS2ODJNs3LUP9kw.desc=Sustainability. It's not the name of the game... but it could be!%n%nIf you've ever wanted to generate many chemicals from a single source, you've probably looked at Oil or Benzene. However there's also the Algae Farm. It's just a pond of sorts, so it doesn't need power to run. Since it also doesn't really follow normal recipes, you won't find any NEI recipe page for the Algae. The multi just produces them on a regular schedule.%n%nThe tier of the multi is given by the casings on the bottom layer of the multi, which all have to match to decide the tier. Each tier decreases the time of the production cycle by a factor of sqrt(2), which means the farm gets faster with each tier.%n%nAt the same time, each tier increase also adds to the amount of Algae you get in a single cycle. Most forms of Algae, except for the first one, are only added in higher tiers. The Algae Farm also accepts Compost, that you can make from the algae itself, to boosts the multi's tier by one. This might be expensive at the start, but it's heavily recommended in most cases.%n%nThe Algae can be used for various chemicals like Methane, Ammonia, Sulfuric Acid, and even some power-generating fluids. You typically need a Chemical Plant for that. In IV tier you can also combine Green Algae with Glowstone to get Glowing Coral and make Sunnarium from that. If you're curious about all the processing chains, look them up on NEI: quests to cover them are coming up, possibly with more recipes that don't need the chemplant.

# Quest: Advanced Xeninol
betterquesting.quest.D0JaazeIQ8qctaMx9xTqEw.name=Advanced Xeninol
betterquesting.quest.D0JaazeIQ8qctaMx9xTqEw.desc=It's here that you might yourself with some useful stuff alongside power. Xenon, which has become very useful in the EBF thanks to noble gas changes in its recipes, and Advanced Nitinol? If you don't already have a Quantum Anomaly setup for it, you can use this. Who knows what'll come in the future?%n%nThese recipes are the same 0.144 ratio ones that you've seen before and, since they're just before the final step, they will bottleneck you on the path to compact reactor setups. The one to focus on is Advanced Nitinol, which is the second last recipe, and where you'll need 9.216, or 10 Mk3 reactors to sustain a Celestial Tungsten compact at the end. If you build a compact here, however, you can feed 6 compacts as long as everything that comes before this is fast enough.

# Quest: GT++ Processing Beyond IV
betterquesting.quest.ECDllKcSQ4SONHHfkfO0yw.name=GT++ Processing Beyond IV
betterquesting.quest.ECDllKcSQ4SONHHfkfO0yw.desc=If you've gotten this far, you already know what these multis are about, and probably built at least a dozen of them. That said, there are about a dozen more with varying levels of usefulness.%n%nUnfortunately, the tiering of a GT++ multi doesn't always say how powerful it is. It is in our best interest that new multis are placed in good spots throughout progression, but there is a lot of old baggage that hasn't stood the test of time.%n%nAs a committed GTNH engineer, you can help uncover the true extent of what GT++ has to offer. You ought not to stop! 

# Quest: I'll teach you... how to Praise the Sun!
betterquesting.quest.Hn_igsosSbKsnATeYgvPgw.name=I'll teach you... how to Praise the Sun!
betterquesting.quest.Hn_igsosSbKsnATeYgvPgw.desc=TL;DR: The casing amount in this quest is for the best Solar Tower, which generates around 2 LuV amps and is a major Stainless Steel, Titanium and HV circuit sink, amongst other things.%n%nHave you ever laid eyes upon a solar panel? You might have built a few of them here. What do they all have in common, I ask you... they generate either Steam or EU directly from sunlight, and that is not efficient. There's something that everybody forgot!%n%nSingleblock solar panels are best to insert anywhere that has sun, and provide constant power to a machine. However, EU storage and transport are easy here, so why not build something better? Instead of generating energy directly, send those warm beams of sunlight into a central structure with circles of Solar Reflectors, and bask in the eternal power of the biggest fusion reactor in the Solar System!%n%n(If you end up making a bigger one, don't come arguing to me about this. Be quiet.)%n%nThe whole idea is that the energy of the Sun's rays is directed towards a fluid that can retain the energy, a Solar Salt that does it far better than water. The Solar Tower transfers heat to all the fluid inside it, but watch out! If there's too much cold Solar Salt inside, it will drain away all the heat and slow down the entire process.%n%nIn more detail, the Solar Tower has a heat value that ranges from 0 to 100000, and it only heats up Solar Salt at 30000 or above. The amount of heat gained per cycle depends on the number of Reflectors, but also the current heat value: this process is optimal at exactly half the maximum, so 50000 heat. To get a perfect tower setup, you have to slowly feed cold Solar Salt to maintain this heat value, taking away just enough heat to keep it there. I'll let you figure out what the flow rate is, given that it depends on how many Reflectors you have.%n%nFrom there, generate Steam or SH Steam by heat-exchanging in the same way as Hot Coolant does it. If you want this setup to truly be optimal, do place it in your personal dimension for permanent daylight.

# Quest: Celestial Tungsten Plasma - The Mk3 Finale
betterquesting.quest.LSqzsH4oS7OQrZyolb7C0A.name=Celestial Tungsten Plasma - The Mk3 Finale
betterquesting.quest.LSqzsH4oS7OQrZyolb7C0A.desc=This is the end of the mk3 fusion chain, and the three chains altogether. After 14 fusion recipes on top of Helium Plasma, you hold in your tanks the elusive Celestial Tungsten Plasma, whose fuel value of 720M makes it immune to XL Plasma penalties all the way to spacetime!%n%nUpscaling plasma powergen up to endgame, and the Dyson Swarm, is most likely reliant on either this or Americium Plasma, which is 1-step but not as powerful on a per-reactor basis. This can net you above 8 billion EU per tick, for every Mk3 compact that you have running Celestial Tungsten at 64 parallels, with Infinity turbines. Upscaling this is not so so difficult, if you keep in mind which recipes will bottleneck you the most, as long as you have the resources for it.%n%nThere are no plasmas that build off Celestial Tungsten Plasma just yet, but it's possible that some might be added in the future, especially for GT++ materials such as Dragonblood. Congratulations on finishing this fusion chain! May the power be with you.

betterquesting.quest.Ng5Ldnf3TZCefB4Mr3u-rQ.desc=Do you know how much Zinc you have in your body? Very little, but it's important. Now imagine it's all plasma!%n%nThis is a very fast recipe, like Niobium Plasma. The only caveat is that it uses Tritium (not Trinium), a rare isotope of Hydrogen that you can obtain from Deuterium, a less rare isotope.

betterquesting.quest.Plg8vg0gS9Ks2Ddc5sIVOg.desc=How do you compress things in the Steam Age? Simple, putting a lot of steam in one place, under high pressure, can apply a force to compress things...%n%nLet's just make it bigger. With the Steam Squasher, you can have a Compressor in a much larger scale, similarly to the Steam Macerator multiblock, which processes 8 recipes at the same time. If you feel like compressing recipes are taking too long, which they probably are, this is a good solution to your problems.%n%nPay close attention to the hatches used for this multi. If they are not the exact ones in this quest, the multi will not form! Once the multi forms, provide lots of steam to get lots of compressed items.

This is Americium Plasma, remember that!%n%nThis is actually the plasma that is probably the best choice for XL Plasma Turbines as a 1-recipe powergen setup. However, compared to Helium and Tin Plasma's previous state, it loses out a lot on speed on a mk3 compact, because it doesn't have the 192x/128x parallels, not to mention its recipe time is already 8x as long as Tin for the same amount of plasma. %n%nIt will also demand huge amount of Pu-241 for a UEV/UIV base to be sustained, but this fusion chain greatly reduces the amount needed, even if both inputs actually need Pu-241.%n%nThis step takes more than half the time of the final step, so it's one of the major bottlenecks: if you upgrade the final step to a compact, you would need 37 mk3 reactors to match speed here.

# Quest: GT++ News in IV
betterquesting.quest.RFgYQ7LAQD-p1gHMaeg5Sg.name=GT++ News in IV
betterquesting.quest.RFgYQ7LAQD-p1gHMaeg5Sg.desc=Upon reaching the land of IV machinery, you can put together even more GT++ multis and speed up your automations!%n%nMost of the GT++ multiblocks from IV tier onwards use special alloys, which either need to be cooked like any ingots you've used before (in a Furnace or EBF), but there are also alloys which have to be made in the Alloy Blast Smelter (ABS), as a fluid, which then needs to be solidified.%n%nThe multis that need ABS alloys are further down. To unlock their quests, you will first need to craft the ABS itself. However, there is a large assortment of machines you can craft without it, just by having the respective IV singleblock equivalent and some other resources.%n%nThose will be here... but you might be able to find some more, if you look closely through NEI. Good luck!

# Quest: Boronic Fusion
betterquesting.quest.Tfb8JzstRNuiSV6CKgTNRQ.name=Boronic Fusion
betterquesting.quest.Tfb8JzstRNuiSV6CKgTNRQ.desc=This plasma needs Helium Plasma to be crafted. That's right, this entire powergen chain builds on top of Helium Plasma!%n%nThe Boron Plasma step is much slower than the Helium one, so if you match the number of reactors and their tier, you will end up with a large excess of Helium Plasma. As you know, it's very useful for power in Large Plasma Turbines, so you could use this excess to power all the other reactors. As you scale up, however, this alone will probably not be enough.%n%nYou will need 3.75 reactors with this recipe to feed 1 reactor with the next step.

# Quest: Niobiumization
betterquesting.quest.X_rOgp6GRKiyGzwRV_p7GA.name=Niobiumization
betterquesting.quest.X_rOgp6GRKiyGzwRV_p7GA.desc=Do you remember Niobium-Titanium? This time, it's just Niobium! Just kidding, Titanium's coming up in a special form...%n%nBoth this and the Zinc Plasma recipe are very fast, so you won't need more than 1 reactor unless your scale is very large. Upgrade later as needed, use a mk2 or even mk3 for now.

# Quest: Welcome to the Plasma Chain
betterquesting.quest.bNiieqPgSFqwFpC2DZkj-g.name=Welcome to the Plasma Chain
betterquesting.quest.bNiieqPgSFqwFpC2DZkj-g.desc=Hello there! If you've unlocked fusion, you can start this questline, but keep in mind that it's divided into three segments (the three fusion chains): one for each tier of Fusion Reactor, from Mk1 to Mk3.%n%nThere is a spreadsheet for all these chains, although it has some reactor count numbers that aren't right. To see it, check the Excel spreadsheet that set these numbers, in the following Github link: §9§n[url]https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GTplusplus/pull/669[/url]§r%n%nThese quests follow the process of creating some truly powerful plasmas that are useful for power generation at the beginning of endgame, when you've scaled up your setup to a Compact Fusion Reactor and XL Plasma Turbines. As you might have seen before, those huge turbines can go very fast with good materials, like Trinium or Infinity, but they will apply EU/t penalties according to the fuel value of the plasma used. This means that Helium and Tin Plasma are both much weaker there than they were in Large Plasma Turbines.%n%nThe end product of this whole process is Celestial Tungsten Plasma, which has no penalties even at Spacetime and can somewhat match what Helium Plasma would have produced, per compact reactor. The last step is the slowest, but, if there are no other bottlenecks, you can expect around§  §2§lover 8 billion EU/t§r assuming a single compact doing the last step with huge infinity turbines in a plasma XL.%n%nHowever, getting there won't be easy. This whole process uses 15 fusion recipes in total, and a lot more material automation than any of the simple fusion setups. This questline will help explain what is simple, not simple, or possibly a bottleneck. If you complete this, you will be sustained in powergen until the Dyson Swarm, or whatever other option appears later on, and it will continue being useful later on!

# Quest: XL Turbo HP Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.yDY1ALr9QdG8zTbEszNaMw.name=XL Turbo HP Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.yDY1ALr9QdG8zTbEszNaMw.desc=High pressure, superheated loads of energy. Check the XL Steam Turbine quest above for an explanation of the mechanics shared across all turbines.%n%nThis XL Turbine is exactly the same as the XL Steam Turbine in the way it upgrades from the regular multi: the only accepted fluid is Superheated Steam, and nothing else works. They are meant to be built together, since any steam setups you might have at this point will surely be using the two.

# Quest: XL Turbo Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.4HoSq97QT3G63VJFeV_0ZQ.name=XL Turbo Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.4HoSq97QT3G63VJFeV_0ZQ.desc=The first of the XL Turbines. Because this is the first, this quest will include an explanation for the mechanics shared across all XL Turbines. %n%nEvery XL Turbine can hold 12 turbine items inside, in the 12 Rotor Assemblies, but their total speed is 16x higher than the regular multiblock equivalent. Make sure all the turbine items inside are of the same material, and also that you can provide enough input to match the flow rate that the multi needs! If you need even more speed, you can enable Fast Mode with a screwdrier on the controller, which triples its speed to 48x. Keep in mind this will chew through the turbine items a lot faster, since their durability goes down faster if the EU output is higher.%n%nThese huge turbines also support TecTech hatches, so you can use buffered dynamos with a much higher output amount than normal, or even laser outputs later on to sustain the hundreds of millions of EU/t that the strongest turbines can produce.%n%nEach of the 5 turbines takes in the same fuels as their smaller counterparts, with some exceptions that will be mentioned in the respective quest. This XL Steam Turbine only consumes Steam, as expected.

# Quest: MV Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWQ.name=§6§lMV Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWQ.desc=Having moved up to MV, you can continue using Steam. However, it's not a great idea to stay here, and other fuel types will be more useful to you instead. This is because Steam Turbine efficiency drops quickly with every tier (this one is only 75%%), and the Steam itself needs big pipes to carry it around, compared to Benzene or Diesel.%n%nThat said, if you want to keep using this, then it's a good idea to build a Large Bronze Boiler or, later on, a Large Steel Boiler. You will need lots of solid fuel, probably Charcoal, so make sure you automate it! Definitely do not forget the water.

# Quest: Standard Nuclear Fuel: Uranium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAvw.name=Standard Nuclear Fuel: Uranium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAvw.desc=Just "regular" uranium fuel, nothing special about it. It produces 5x the power, and 4x the heat of thorium, while lasting 2/5 the time.%n%nMost fuel rods are basically this, but slightly modified. You generally get this from Mars and it's moons, but you can get a little from centrifuging thorium if you want.%n%nBTW, one of the reactor types 'pulses' the reactor to turn it off once it gets too hot. You can pack in the rods and then cool it off for a while to get higher efficiency out of each rod. Try it if you like explosions.

# Quest: Tricky Nuclear Fuel: MOX
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwA.name=Tricky Nuclear Fuel: MOX
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwA.desc=Under normal conditions, produces the same amount of power as uranium, but MOX produces more power the more you let the reactor heat up. Try to come up with a heat-neutral design as close to the limit as possible to take advantage of this. It lasts 1/2 the time, and produces more heat once the reactor is over 50%%. A fuel for all the engineers out there.%n%n§3You'll need to run a uranium reactor for a while to get some plutonium if you don't have another way to get it. Remember that there's more than 1 type!%n%n§4Make sure to test in creative and/or use protection against explosions!

# Quest: Alternate Nuclear Fuel: Tiberium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxg.name=Alternate Nuclear Fuel: Tiberium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxg.desc=They're the same as uranium but produce half as much heat. Given that there's no reactor designs floating around, and the fact that you need to go to Ross128ba, a T5 rocket (LuV) planet to get the tiberium, I'm gonna say they're probably not worth it. If you disagree, make a design and show it to people, 'kay?

# Quest: Obscenely Dangerous Nuclear Fuel: The Core
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB6g.name=Obscenely Dangerous Nuclear Fuel: The Core
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB6g.desc=For the truly insane mad scientists out there. Or people who can read a website (not guaranteed, trust me!). You HAVE to use coolant cells with it if you want power or to have it not explode after 1s.

# Quest: We Need Big Toys
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDw.name=§6§lWe Need Big Toys
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDw.desc=All your little turbines take up too much space? Are you running out of water? It's time to solve these problems. This Large Steam Turbine can help you produce a tremendous amount of energy. It will also distill water for you, so you can use the same water again inside your Large Boiler. Don't forget to make a rotor for the turbine and put inside the controller, otherwise this multiblock won't do anything.%n%nEach turbine has a specific optimal flow, the Steam flow that gives the highest fuel efficiency, the value shown on the turbine's tooltip. This is the flow you want to match, and you can use a Fluid Regulator as a cover to make it exactly what you want, but you can go beyond this flow to get an even higher EU/t value, at a loss of fuel efficiency. You can make turbines in 4 different sizes, with larger turbines producing more EU/t, but with variying amounts of fuel efficiency. Generally, Large is the best due to having the highest fuel efficiency and a good optimal flow rate%n%nWhen using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Steam Turbines being the worst at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 150%% of optimal flow to produce 112%% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 200%% of optimal flow to produce 133%% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 250%% of optimal flow to produce 156%% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away. Don't exceed your dynamo hatch's maximum EU/t output, though, or you will have problems!%n%nTurbines with a small turbine durability below 75k have their recipes removed. Use NEI with the appropriate long rod to find assembler recipes that will work for you. Or the spreadsheet. Long magnalium for small turbines, long titanium for normal turbines, etc.%n%nPre-moon, the best rotors are Shadow Metal or Vibrant Alloy.%n%nPost-moon, the best HV rotors are Shadow Metal or Oriharukon (this is IV-tier). Luckily, turbines are now fully functional with multi-amp dynamos, so give those a try if you need extra amps!%n%nFor additional choices, see the spreadsheet and Large Turbine Calculator.

# Quest: Essentia Generator: Auram
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFNg.name=Essentia Generator: Auram

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFNw.desc=Compressed Solar Panels can be infused with Aspects for certain additional features. Check them out and choose one of them.

# Quest: Double Compressed Solar

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFOA.desc=100EU/t for 72x1EU/t Solars? Sounds like a good deal. Get one of these. They can be Infused as well.

# Quest: Even More Infused

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFOQ.desc=You can infuse double or triple compressed solars as well.

# Quest: Triple Compressed Solar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFOg.name=Triple Compressed Solar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFOg.desc=Triple Compressed Solars. Yes, that's right. They are a bit more expensive than their lower counterparts, 576 Solars in total. But they give out 1,000 GT EU per tick and have no need to be cleaned.  How so? Magic.

# Quest: Essentia Generator: Ignis

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFPg.desc=This highly-warped, high-power Essentia generator is a lifesaver, when you run out of energy. Just toss some gold into your Arcane Furnace and burn the Lucrum you get.

# Quest: HV Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFew.name=§9§lHV Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFew.desc=Using Steam as your single power source in HV is pretty difficult. Your fuel automation will have to be very fast, your pipes will have to be very big and the final efficiency of HV Steam Turbines is 66%%, much lower than the other generators' 85%%. %n%nThis is best used with an efficient furnace, like the GT++ Advanced Furnaces, to power something specific like a farm. Powering your entire automation in your path to an EV, using only these, is a nightmare. If you want more efficiency out of your Steam, consider building a Large Steam Turbine.

# Quest: What Was That? I Can't Hear You Over the Engine!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFyQ.name=What Was That? I Can't Hear You Over the Engine!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFyQ.desc=The Extreme Combustion Engine is an upgrade to the Large Combustion Engine, the IV version that needs Tungstensteel instead of Titanium. The structure is essentially the same, and it's almost a 1:1 ratio between the two materials, so this is a good generator when you've accumulated several stacks of Tungsteensteel.%n%nThe caveat is that it only accepts High Octane Gasoline. This is the last and most powerful type of combustion fluid made from Oil, and it has the longest processing line of them all. As a reward, it has an excellent §e§b§a2.5M EU per bucket§a§r, and you can burn it here alongside some Liquid Oxygen for almost §a4 IV amps per tick.%n%n§cThe Liquid Oxygen is very important, because it greatly boosts the speed of the multi and the fuel efficiency as well. §f§rIt needs 40 L/s, so you will need more than one Vacuum Freezer to supply it continuously: for an ECE that is always running, you will need a double Vacuum Freezer, 1 EV and 1 HV. You can run less freezers if you overclock them, if the ECE isn't working all the time or if you upgrade to a Cryogenic Freezer,

# Quest: Power of the Sun at EV Level

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGuA.name=§c§lPower of the Sun at IV Level
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGuA.desc=The next solar panel you can make is the IV one. It generates 8192 EU/t. This is probably the last tier it's worth it to make solars, unless you just really like them.

# Quest: Power of the Sun 1x1 IV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGuQ.name=§c§lPower of the Sun 1x1 IV

# Quest: Do You Hear That Engine Revving?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGzA.name=§6§lDo You Hear That Engine Revving?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGzA.desc=Your old and trusty combustion engines don't quite cut it anymore, not to mention they're polluting the place. If you want to keep burning liquids, you need to build a better engine. This multiblock can produce 1A of EV voltage by default and 3A if you supply it with oxygen. However, this power doesn't come for free - you need to supply the machine with small amounts of lubricant constantly (and oxygen if you want to boost both its efficiency and output).%n%nYou will also require 3 Input Hatches, a Muffler, and a Dynamo Hatch. Their tiers are up to you.%n%nCetane Boosted Diesel and High Octane Gasoline (HOG) are excellent fuel sources for this engine.%n%nYou will need to keep the area in front of the engine clear so it can pull enough air - not even torches.

# Quest: The Church of Benzene's Holy Altar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHTQ.name=§6§lThe Church of Benzene's Holy Altar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHTQ.desc=The MV Gas Turbine pairs excellently with Benzene, now that you can actually make it. Look at the "Bio for the Masses" tab for more details on how to go about it, or just check NEI. Benzene is renewable from trees, and it's a powerful source of EU that can keep you going for several tiers as long as you upgrade it with the new multiblocks you unlock over time.%n%nIt's a good idea to switch off Steam, since you need big pipes to carry that around and the fuel efficiency on Steam Turbines is lower. Instead, make a Pyrolyse Oven or an Advanced Coke Oven to make Charcoal faster, extract Benzene from it and run it through a few of these Gas Turbines.

# Quest: Diesel Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHTg.name=§6§lDiesel Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHTg.desc=The MV Combustion Generator burns Light Fuel faster than the LV version, but you can also automate Diesel and burn that instead, since it's even more powerful. It is arguably the easiest and most efficient way to generate lots of power for automation at this stage, and it'll last you a couple more tiers if you upgrade it as you go.%n%nAdditionally, Diesel can be used as fuel for the Copterpack, a good jetpack that makes it much easier to move around, inside and outside of your base. It's heavily recommended that you make one, if you have Diesel.%n%n§3This will also unlock new quests in the Armors and Jetpacks tab.

# Quest: Fluid Regulator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHZQ.name=§6§lFluid Regulator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHZQ.desc=Turbines require precise amounts of fluids or else they will §4explode§r. Use the fluid regulator on the pipe attached to the input bus to control the rate of fluids into the turbine. To raise the fluid limit, look at the right side of the regulator and:%n%n1L - Right click with an empty hand%n16L - Right click with a screwdriver%n256L - Right click with a screwdriver while sneaking%n%nTo lower the fluid limit, do the same while looking at the left side.%n%nUse the Large Turbine Calculator and the Turbine stats sheet on the spreadsheet to find what to set it to (after deciding on a fuel). At GTNH, we do the math for you! For this at least.%n%n§3If you shift-right click on it you can use the interface which is more precise.

# Quest: Gas Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHZg.name=§6§lGas Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHZg.desc=A Large Gas Turbine is more fuel-efficient than singleblock turbines, and can have lower pollution output with upgraded mufflers.%n%nYou will also need a Muffler and Dynamo Hatch to complete the multiblock. Don't forget to use a Fluid Regulator, to control the flow rate into the multi! It can usually be an LV Fluid Regulator, since the optimal flow is much lower here than in Steam Turbines.%n%nEach turbine material has a specific fuel efficiency (the higher, the more EU you get from the same amount of fuel), and the multi only reaches this efficiency if the fuel flow into it matches the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 150%% of optimal flow to produce 112%% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 300%% of optimal flow to produce 180%% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 450%% of optimal flow to produce 252%% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.%n%nFor the best turbine materials, see the spreadsheet and Large Turbine Calculator.%n%n§4Going forward, the LGT will be capped at 8192 EU/t. You will need to use the advanced large gas turbine beyond that which can only take high value fuels.%n%n%n%n

# Quest: Large Heat Exchanger - Fermat's Last
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHcQ.name=§6§lLarge Heat Exchanger - Fermat's Last
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHcQ.desc=The Large Heat Exchanger is a powergen multi that accepts a non-direct fuel, and doesn't output EU. What is it for, then? §7To heat up water with hot liquids, that's what!§r%n%nEffectively, it's a Steam Boiler that uses fluids instead of solids, but it's more complicated. The two main sources of energy here are Lava and Hot Coolant, and the second is more powerful, but harder to get. Lava can be automated from Everburn Urns or a myriad of other option, while Hot Coolant usually requires a proper powergen setup.%n%nFor Lava, the LHE will output §d160 L of Steam for every 1 L of Lava, up to 1000 L/s of Lava input§r (§a4000 EU/t§r at 100%% turbine efficiency). For Hot Coolant, the LHE will output §d400 L of Steam for every 1 L of Hot Coolant, up to 800 L/s of input§r (§a8000 EU/t§r at 100%% turbine efficiency).%n%n§cIf you go above these input rates, the output becomes Superheated Steam, which needs to pass through a Large HP Steam Turbine before the regular Large Steam Turbine.§r The maximum input rate here is twice of what was before, the conversion is §d1:80 for Lava§r and §d1:200 for Hot Coolant§r, and the energy output at 100%% turbine efficiency is §a12000 EU/t§r for Lava and §a24000 EU/t§r for Hot Coolant.%n%n§6§lVery powerful, but complicated, and needs turbines!§r%n%n§3For more information, go to §9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Large_Heat_Exchanger[/url]§r§3 and read about it there, or to §9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Fluid_Reactor[/url]§r§3 for how to use it in a Fluid Reactor setup.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK4g.name=How Many Forests Did You Cut Down to Power This?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK4g.desc=This is the HV version, with the lowest efficiency so far of 85%%. You can offset that by just generating more Benzene, alongside Phenol and Toluene in a Distillation Tower, or use Naphtha instead... You have many options at this point, surely enough to fight the increasing power demands of your automation.%n%nBenzene doesn't get upgraded in HV, only in EV.

# Quest: Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators LV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5A.name=Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators LV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5A.desc=You've probably collected a ton of Creosote and have little to use it on. To fix that, build a Semifluid Generator and use it alongside Steam as a secondary power source! Singleblock generators will only use fuel if there is EU demand, so you might end up with a filled Creosote buffer if you aren't consuming enough EU.%n%nTo extract the Creosote from your Coke Ovens, you can use buckets or cells to do it by hand, or the TiCon Faucet into GT fluid pipes, or an Electric Pump cover from You're Going to Hate This #2.%n%nThere are other options to burn Creosote, like the Railcraft Liquid Boilers, but this is much cheaper and easier to set up, while still being efficient with Creosote (6x as efficient as Combustion Generators).

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5Q.desc=If you're still burning Creosote for power, you can get MV amps out of it with these machines. It won't last long, and definitely isn't a good main power source, but it'll give you some EU for your trouble.%n%nAlternatively, Heavy Fuel? It has the same EU per bucket as Benzene, 360k, and is the only semifluid with more than 100k per bucket. If you have it, and are not consuming enough for Diesel, you can use it this way.

# Quest: Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5g.name=Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK5g.desc=If you've built Distillation Towers to improve your Oil or Benzene processing line, you might have ended up with some extra fuels that are semifluids, such as Heavy Fuel or Creosote. If you've accumulated them so much that they've started voiding, you can instead make an HV Semifluid Generator and get free power out of them!%n%nThe Creosote from one DT that is processing Wood Tar is enough to power the DT itself, depending on the fuel efficiency. One HV generator is just enough to power it.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALCg.desc=It's the same as the previous, but more/better. It takes less time to heat up, but it chews through fuel pretty fast too. It still isn't as good as an LGT for power produced over time, but it can produce power faster. As long as you use it with the HP Steam Turbine.%n%nIt can produce 1A+ of LuV if you set it up right.

# Quest: Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Mk I
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALCw.name=Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Mk I
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALCw.desc=It uses Gas fuels to produce power and Steam at the same time, while also generating 0 pollution. If the other generators were being problematic, this is the best solution.%n%nIt produces §a4 HV amps per tick§r at a nice fuel efficiency, while consuming 100 L of Oxygen per second. It will heat up over time until it reaches 100%% efficiency, at which point it starts outputting Steam as well. You can then use Steam Turbines, singleblocks or multiblocks, to generate even more power.%n%nWith these two things combined, it's more powerful than the Large Gas Turbine that you can build at the start. Only when you unlock better materials for that, will it generate more power than the SOFC Mk I.

# Quest: It's 'Super' Heated Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDA.name=It's 'Super' Heated Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDA.desc=So that means it produces §otwice§r as much power! You can get this steam through the LHE, the SOFC Mk II or the Titanium/Tungstensteel Boilers. It gets converted to normal steam as the output at a 1:1 ratio, so make sure to have a non-HP one to take advantage of that. In total, a HP Steam Turbine and a regular one combined produce 3x the EU with Superheated Steam that normal Steam would produce.

# Quest: More Advanced Reactors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDQ.name=More Advanced Reactors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDQ.desc=Fluid Nukes, Vac Nukes and Wrench Reactors (lol), are more advanced versions of the normal one.%n%nFluid means you build it differently (with the parts on the right, it's a 5x5 cube surrounding the normal one), with the goal of producing as much hot coolant (cycle in non-hot) as possible, to use that to produce power. It doesn't produce power on it's own, but more overall. Send it to the LHE to get SH steam out of it, then go through a HP steam turbine, then a normal steam turbine.%n%nVac nukes remove heat by sending it to coolant cells instead of coolant. Any cell in a cardinal direction will receive the heat instead of the reactor. Use a vacuum freezer to restore the Helium/NaK cells' durability.%n%nWrench reactors are when you fill the reacor with fuel rods, turn it on, and wrench it to reset it's heat state before it explodes. If you can automate it, you deserve a medal!%n%nIf you still don't know what a MOX one is, it produces more power the higher the temperature, so you try to keep it heat neutral, and as hot as possible. Of course, this can cause things nearby to, well, §omelt.§r You use MOX or Naquadria fuel cells work for this. You can also get more Plutonium out of MOX than Uranium.%n%nA breeder reactor is when you setup a reactor to get an item out of it rather than power, like Lutetium from Thorium, Plutonium from MOX, etc. Look at the depleted x fuel rod list in NEI or on the wiki to see more.%n%n§3Since Fluid Nukes are liable to explode if you run out of coolant, make sure you setup a cutoff tied to the temperature or amount of coolant with redstone.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALhA.desc=The multi block version of the naquadah reactor, but it is completely different from the single block ones.%n%nIt uses liquid naquadah or excited nuclear liquid as fuel, and outputs the depleted fuel. You can see the liquid fuel infomation in NEI.%n%nIt consumes 2400 L/s liquid air when running, otherwise it will keep consuming your fuel without outputting power.%n%n§4It will explode with more than one types of fuel in its hatches.%n%n§rYou can input in coolant to increase efficiency.%nIC2 Coolant: 1.05x%nSuper Coolant: 1.5x%nCryotheum: 2.75x%nTachyon Rich Temporal Fluid: 5.00x %n%nYou can also input molten metals to increase power.%nMolten Caesium: 2x%nMolten Uranium-235: 3x%nMolten Naquadah: 4x%nMolten Atomic Separation Catalyst: 16x%nSpatially Enlarged Fluid: 64x%nNote: It will consume more fuel to match the output power, unlike coolant which directly increases the power. The molten metal works like 'parallels' for your reactor.%n%nIt also supports §9Tec§1Tech§r's Multi-Amp Dynamo hatches and laser hatches.%n%n§3PS: This generator has the highest output power in this pack currently, even ahead the Dyson with Mark VI fuels.

Well, if you are a crazy fan of diesel or benzene, you will love it.%n%nThis engine accepts all diesel, gas and also rocket fuel, although the Rocketdyne burns the latter more efficiently. It also needs Combustion Promoter to keep it running.%n%nThis engine consumes all fuel and combustion promoter in its input hatches per second and outputs power depending on the amount of fuel consumed, and its fuel value.%n%nIts efficiency is determined by the Combustion Promoter/Fuel ratio. If the ratio is larger (there is more promoter), the efficiency will be higher. The max efficiency is 150%%, but you cannot achieve this value without inputting an infinite amount of promoter. Expect efficiencies around 130%% for high fuel value fuels like High-Octane Gasoline, unless you spend a LOT of promoter.%n%ne.g. You input 100mB/s of HOG and 1000mB/s of combustion promoter. The efficiency is 149%% and the sum of the HOG fuel value is 250000 EU. The output power will be 250,000 * 149%% / 20 = 18625 EU/t.

# Quest: XL Turbo Plasma Turbine
betterquesting.quest.dQ1k0UZVR8ObXotgcryKbw.name=XL Turbo Plasma Turbine
betterquesting.quest.dQ1k0UZVR8ObXotgcryKbw.desc=Is plasma flow making the turbines spin? No, it's just water into steam into water, all recycled inside, 12 times over. Check the XL Steam Turbine quest above for an explanation of the mechanics shared across all turbines.%n%nThis turbine, unlike the others, has very important differences to the regular multi that you have to keep in mind. Given that plasma power is so easy to upscale with the use of compact reactors, XL Plasma Turbines would have to follow suit and bring progression's EU numbers to ridiculous degrees, off one single plasma. However, this XL now applies an EU/t penalty to its production by comparing the fuel value of the plasma it processes with the rotor material it has inside.%n%nSee §9§n[url]https://i.imgur.com/vifsk0P.png[/url]§r for various combinations of plasmas and materials. Mk1 plasmas are in green, Mk2 in yellow and Mk3 in red. The bottom 3 are the final plasmas of the fusion chains.%n%nThe formula is a bit complicated, but here are some important values:%n%n-> Helium Plasma receives a huge penalty of 86.1%% even with Infinity Catalyst, whereas Tin's penalty is only 53.5%%, which means that the number of reactors and XLs with this material is twice the expected amount if using Tin Plasma;%n-> Trinium changes these numbers to 92.4%% and 74.5%%, respectively;%n-> Infinity further increases the penalty to 97.4%% and 91.1%%;%n-> Spacetime sets these values to 98.3%% and 94.4%%.%n%nThis means that, at the UHV/UEV stage, you will no longer be able to rely on these two plasmas with your XLs. For 1-recipe plasmas, your best option is the mk3 Americium Plasma, which has an insignificant 0.8%% penalty with Infinity. If you want faster powergen than that, check out the complete fusion chain that ends at Celestial Tungsten Plasma, which has no penalties in the XL Plasma Turbine and has total EU/t numbers compared to Helium's old ones. Check the GT++ tab for quests regarding the fusion chains.

# Quest: Battery Buffer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaw.name=Battery Buffer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaw.desc=Batteries work pretty much the same in a battery buffer as in a regular machine's battery slot. Battery buffers are used to buffer power to stabilize output.%n%nThey come in different sizes: 1, 4, 9(!) and 16 slots. They can draw 2A and output 1A per battery inserted - watch your wire amperage! Cables come in 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 12x, and 16x, with tin transferring 1A per size. Make sure not to mess up, or your cable will melt, becoming a fire, and possibly an explosion.%n%nRemember that there's loss when outputting EU from any GT machine, so putting 4 4-slot ones in a row loses 8 power compared to 2 from 1 16-slot one. And this is for every amp too.%n%n§3You can import batteries into one, but ONLY empty acid batteries can be exported from one. No, you can't get around this.

Step-up means 4A LV in, 1A MV out, while step-down means the reverse.%n%n§4Make sure§r you understand the following if you prefer your base not being a crater:%nA step-down mode is the default one. In this mode, the large dot is the input. In a step-up mode, it's the output. §4Do not§r mix it up. LV machines that receive MV power will explode.%n%nIf the transformer is connected to power, or was in the past, then §4do not§r change the mode with stuff connected. It's better to break and place it again to get rid of the stored power rather than rotate it with the wrench and blow things up. Make sure to also disconnect the nearby wires with a wire cutter.%n%nAs a reminder, machines don't blow up if they are given more amps than they can consume. They blow up from higher voltage tier.

# Quest: Infinite Energy Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALmw.name=Infinite Energy Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALmw.desc=You shouldn't click on links from strangers! Although this sounds like clickbait it is true. From a certain point of view.%n%nUse the (potential) force! And store energy that way. Simply construct a dam and flood vast areas with water. You may add energy to your storage by pumping more water into it or just drain it back into energy whenever you need. This works especially well with fluctuating energy sources like wind, water, and solar. Or you dump excess energy into it so you can use it another time. The capacity is huge and the choice is yours.%n%nSounds great! But...? - Indeed. There is a catch: Pumps and Turbines will have efficiency correlated loss. Still interested? Let's get to crafting!%n%nThe multi-block has an unusual shape: the back is open. The lake will spawn inside the multi-block and spread block-by-block as far as it can/is allowed. It will replace plants like water (make sure to secure your IC2 Crops!) but not replace any solid blocks. Additionally, you can specify limits in any direction. The water will NEVER spread past these limits. You can set those limits in a second GUI by right clicking the controller with a screwdriver.%n%nWhen you enter a limit, it will correct itself to the nearest valid setting. Especially if you try to spread past the server limits. You may talk your admin into raising these limits (these limits are designed to limit griefing). Further, water is not able to spread into foreign towns.%nYou will also find 3 magical buttons in the top-right of this GUI. From left to right: The first will slowly despawn the lake blocks. You can use this to shrink the lake if it spread past a barrier for example. The multi-block will also initialize with this configuration so there is no accidental flooding. The second and third buttons will slowly spawn more lake blocks. Additionally, the second button will render those lake blocks pink so you see where they are so you may plug holes and such. In this "debug" mode you can walk/breathe/act in the lake like in air. This should make it easy to create a sunken village for decoration purposes. The third button is for normal operations so you can see the water and enjoy a swim in your energy buffer.%n%nOf course, there is also a normal GUI (simple right-click). It shows you the energy stored in the dam. To reach higher water levels you are required to use stronger pumps. For this purpose, you may configure the voltage tier of the GUI with a circuit in the circuit slot. Don't worry: It is only optical. You cannot void any energy if you set a low voltage tier. It is only for the player information. You may give it a try with the reward you earn...%n%nIf you have any further questions, find missing information, or have suggestions please do not hesitate to post on the official GT New Horizons Discord. Please add '@SinTh0r4s' to your post to make sure I’ll see it.%n%n§4A warning though: there have been a lot of mentions of bugs and even world corruptions caused by the Hydro Dam.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALnA.desc=If you made it this far you may already noticed that you cannot pour vanilla water into the dam. That’s what a HydroEnergy Pump is for. This multi-block exists in multiple tiers and will allow you to reach higher water levels (= more energy capacity). Provide the pump with vanilla water as input and pipe the fluid output into the dam. Then the dam will slowly fill up. If the dam is full or full for a pump’s voltage tier, it will void the water and energy.%n%nThat's all folks!

# Quest: Power in the Ether
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMow.name=Power in the Ether
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMow.desc=These new hatches allow you to wirelessly send, store and receive energy from any location in any dimension. They can be placed in any existing multi block structure and will function as normal energy/dynamo hatches. A dynamo hatch will consume EU and store it in a global network linked to your user. The wireless network can store a total of 2^(2^31) EU, far exceeding even a max tier LSC.%n%nYou can share a wireless network with others by adding them to your network with /gt global_energy_join user1 user2. This will make user1 use user2's energy when interacting with the global network. You can leave a network at any time by doing /gt global_energy_join your_name your_name. %n%nYou cannot connect wires to these blocks. These are also designed to be highly lag efficient, meaning EU is added at large intervals to prevent needless calculations from occurring.

Are you a fan of lightning bolts zapping around your base?%n%nThen this multiblock is for you, the Telsa Tower comes with high amperage output and full TecTech energy hatch support with this powerful multiblock.%n%nTo get started you will need to fill the tower with capacitors matching the tier of the Primary Tesla Windings within the capacitor bank. The Tesla Winding determines the tier of power that the tower transfers power at and the amount of capacitors determines the maximum amperage that can be output. %n%nA total of 16 capacitors can be placed into one capacitor bank so you might need many banks depending on your power needs.%n%nOnce the tower is constructed click open the controller to configure the maximum transfer distance of the tower to fit the needs of your base. The range setting is currently buggy which means that at least for now you can do so without needing any plasmas. This option is called “Tesla Towers Transfer Radius Setting”.%n%nNow that your tower is all configured how do you get power out of it to your machines? Well I am glad you asked. To get power to the machines of the base you will need to use the Tesla Coil Covers. Place them on your machines, energy hatches and even transformers to get power flowing from the tower. Energy hatches are a bit picky however and the hatch likes to be facing upwards to receive power.%n%n§4Warning! The Tesla Tower will output only one tier of amp such as EV, IV etc. When upgrading the Primary Tesla Windings please make sure to check all of your coil covers and transceivers in the base can handle the upgraded power. Failure to do so will result in a machine explosion.%n%nFailure to turn off the controller before adjustment can also cause an explosion.


## Quest Line: Working with Oil
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADw.name=Working with Oil
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADw.desc=A questline about oil refining, oil byproducts, and oil based power generation.

# Quest: Simple Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqA.name=Simple Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqA.desc=As rich as Oil is, it's hardly useful for anything in this state. One of the most important parts in the processing chain is distillation, which separates the components of this black mixture by the difference in their boiling points. You can do this in a Distillery, starting in LV, but for now only one of the fractions can be obtained at a time: you must choose which one you want.%n%nLighter fractions are generally more useful than heavier ones, but that doesn't mean that lightest is best. For now, going for Sulfuric Light Fuel is the best option, since it will become a good source of power after being treated. Don't use unprocessed oil to power these machines, stick to Steam until you can use something better.%n%n§3You can find info about the other fractions in the LV tab!

# Quest: Oil Drilling Rig
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqw.name=Oil Drilling Rig
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqw.desc=In the MV tier, Oil gets a big boost in its effectiveness, and becomes a fantastic powergen option for anyone wanting to switch off Steam, if they haven't done it already. It becomes difficult to use Steam as the only power source in this tier, so you should find a more reliable way to get power.%n%nOf course, you might already be using Light Fuel as your power source of choice, but a different question might have popped up in your mind by now: is there a better way to get Oil? Perhaps you have run short, or perhaps not. Either way, there is a multi unlocked in this tier that can greatly facilitate the automation of Oil input into your Distillery. That multi is the Oil Drilling Rig, which can pump it from below bedrock, but only if there is some in the current chunk, which means that you will have to scan the chunks around you to find it.%n%nThere is a quest for this rig in the Multiblock Goals tab. Go check it out!

# Quest: Distillation Tower
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrA.name=Distillation Tower
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrA.desc=In HV, your oil processing options soar to new levels of complexity, and efficiency. Many of the processing multis that can be used are unlocked in this tier, and one of the most iconic is the Distillation Tower, the direct upgrade of the Distillery.%n%nThis tower can do actual fractional distillation, a process used in real life petrochemistry to separate oil into many different parts, based on their boiling points. The tall structure is required for the process, because the condensation of the vapours occurs in different temperatures. And since heating is only applied at the bottom, temperature drops the higher the vapour travels. This means that compounds with higher boiling points will condense sooner and will end up lower in the column, the opposite is also applicable for compounds with low boiling points.%n%nThat said, the Distillation Tower replaces Distilleries by allowing you to collect all fractions at once, from the same amount of input. This means that the tower is both more efficient, and also allows automation of all the outputs at the same time, but this comes at a cost: the controller needs EV circuits, which require a built Cleanroom, and the structure blocks are mostly made of Stainless Steel. Not only that, but the tower's height depends on the recipe, since each output needs its own height level to successfully be extracted. A max-height, 12-block tall DT can cost almost a dozen stacks of stainless to build, a very expensive multi for the tier.%n%nInstead of doing that, the first DT you should build is a 5-block tall one, to distill the Oil you're pumping out of reservoirs. Doing this, you can get all the fractions at once, for a reasonably cheap multi, compared to its maximum size.

# Quest: The Era of Multis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrQ.name=The Era of Multis
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrQ.desc=What does this mean, "the era of multis"? I've built so many multis already!%n%nWell, yes, but now it's all multiblocks. There are still singleblock machines for all the tasks they're needed for, but at IV the newer GT++ multis become available, or at least most of them, which can do the same jobs of bending, extruding, extracting, amongst others, but with higher initial investments and many bonuses to their processing. Remember what I said before about higher initial investments being worth it?%n%nThat said, there isn't a new oil processing chain in IV, you only improve what you already have. If there was a step in the chain that was running too slow, and you needed to add more machines to it or overclock, it's likely that there is now a multi that can take over that role by itself. Tungstensteel is usually an important part of these things, so get it automated in anticipation of what's to come.

# Quest: Generator Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrg.name=Generator Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrg.desc=Welcome to EV! If you thought the previous tier had a big jump in oil processing, you are correct, but now it's going to jump up all over again!%n%nThis tier does not unlock new processing multis like HV did, but it does bring better, much better generators. From now on, your main generators options will almost always be multiblocks, unless you need an easy-to-move generator for a multiblock miner or something similar. For your diesel fuels, the next step is the Large Combustion Engine (LCE), and there is a quest for it on the Multiblock Goals tab as usual. This, however, is a big investment in Titanium, amongst other things, so I hope you have that processing automated already.%n%nIf you boost the LCE, you will get both a huge boost in EU/t and efficiency. While an HV Diesel Generator had an output of 512 EU/t at 85%% efficiency, this expensive multi outputs 6144 EU/t at 150%% efficiency! Make sure you have an EV Buffered Dynamo Hatch that can handle this output.%nThere is an equivalent turbine for gases, like the Refinery Gas you might be using to power your oil processing setup, which is cheaper to build but its performance depends on the turbine placed inside it, and you won't be able to get near the levels of the LCE unless you get some Tungstensteel, and a good metal like Shadow Metal.

# Quest: Desulfurizing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrw.name=Desulfurizing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrw.desc=After distillation, the fluid you got still isn't that good. It can be used for power, but it's almost as bad as Oil itself unless you remove the sulfuric content it has. This applies for all the portions that can be distilled from Oil, and as such it's a required step regardless of which one you're working with. %n%nTo get clean Light Fuel, the sulfur needs to be drawn out with something that reacts with it, in a Chemical Reactor. What you need is Hydrogen, a relatively common gas that can be electrolyzed from water, or from specific ores (check NEI for all the possible sources). After reacting, you will get Hydrogen Sulfide and the clean Light Fuel, which can be further processed or burned for power at this stage.

# Quest: Light Fuel Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsA.name=Light Fuel Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsA.desc=Light Fuel is a great power source in LV, for several reasons. Not only is it much more power-dense than Steam, which means that you need a smaller amount of it to get the same EU amount, but the generators that can burn it have a higher fuel efficiency than the Steam ones. Even wooden fluid pipes will be enough to transport this fuel!%n%nThat said, your old generators will not accept Light Fuel, so you will have to make some Combustion Generators to get power out of it. You'll still get one LV amp out of each, which means you might have to make more if you are running several machines at once. By the time you build your first Electric Blast Furnace, you will want 4 of these feeding it power.

# Quest: Basic Cracking
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsQ.name=Basic Cracking
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsQ.desc=Despite what the Distillery recipe might have led you to believe, there are many more fractions of Oil than the four you could choose from. However, to get the rest of the oil byproducts, you need to split these four into the others, a process known as cracking. To crack the fuels, they must not be sulfuric, and you will need either Hydrogen (hydro-cracking) or Steam (steam-cracking) to successfully crack. Your Hydrogen source for desulfurizing is hopefully good enough to sustain hydro-cracking, and the Steam you were previously using for power can now be useful to get more out of the Oil you're pumping.%n%nHeavy Fuel, Light Fuel, Refinery Gas and Naphtha can each be cracked both ways, and with three different intensities: lightly, moderately or severely cracked. This means that each portion has 6 different cracking options, and the products of distilling them can be cracked once more! There are a lot of options here, but a few of them stand out for their usefulness.%n%nThe first one you should attempt starts with Refinery Gas, instead of Light Fuel, so switch your Distillery to produce that, and get some Steam.%n%n%n§3Make x5 as many cells if you don't want to waste anything

# Quest: Early Ethylene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsg.name=Early Ethylene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsg.desc=In LV, cracking fuels is only possible in a Chemical Reactor, which has a lower efficiency than the Oil Cracker multiblock that is available at HV. That said, it is still a great source of some fluids, one of which being Ethylene, the precursor to Polyethylene, the first plastic that can be produced and a required part of progression in the pack. To obtain Ethylene from Oil, the best way to go is to severely steam-crack Refinery Gas.%n%nSimply put the Refinery Gas and the Steam in a Chemical Reactor with the correct circuit (check NEI) and then distill the cracked Refinery Gas. It can give a lot of different outputs, so make sure you choose the right one. After doing this, you'll have successfully processed Oil, both for power and for byproducts. Congratulations!%n%n%n§3After you unlock different types of oil from underground fluids at MV the best route to ethylene may change depending on what type of oil you will decide to extract.

# Quest: Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsw.name=Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsw.desc=This sulfuric waste that came out of the oil fractions could be voided, but it's actually a useful byproduct for your progression. The Hydrogen Sulfide that you obtained, mixed with Water in another Chemical Reactor will give back Diluted Sulfuric Acid, which can be turned into its more concentrated form by distilling it.%n%nSulfuric Acid is one of the most important chemicals in the pack, so make sure to use this opportunity to automate it. It's needed for circuits, amongst other things, so you will need a lot of it.

# Quest: Oil Reservoirs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtA.name=Oil Reservoirs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtA.desc=Unlike the oil spouts that are visible on the surface, the underground reservoirs cannot be seen or measured without the use of specific tools.%nThe main quest for prospecting "Analyzing the Soil" is in the LV tab.

# Quest: More Hydrogen
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtQ.name=More Hydrogen
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtQ.desc=With more Oil in your hands, you are sure to have problems with the other inputs you need. Hydrogen is required to get any type of clean byproduct, and the amount you need scales with the speed at which your Chemical Reactors work. It is possible to get a lot of it from ores, and mining out a Limonite vein will get you enough to last a long while, but it will eventually run out. Which automatic sources can you choose from?%n%nThe simplest option is to electrolyze water. You can just keep feeding water for free, but it's a slow and inefficient process, although it also gives you Oxygen. You will need a few Electrolyzers running to keep it going at a decent pace. %n%nAn alternative option is to do this, but with salt water, obtained from Salty Root, if you have delved into IC2 crops. You will also get Chlorine that you will need very often in the next two tiers.%n%nLastly, did you know that most of the oil byproducts are organic compounds, and as such are made mostly of Carbon and Hydrogen? You can electrolyze most of them to get these elements, at a faster rate than water, but only if you have leftovers. Methane is one of the choices that you might have stockpiling. However, note that these byproducts often have fuel values and it's often better to use them as fuel to then electrolyze (salt) water.%n%nEither way, you will need Electrolyzers. Build some to continue!

# Quest: Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtg.name=Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtg.desc=There is a better way to get fuel from Oil in MV, but you will need to expand into other fractions instead of just using Light Fuel. The next step is Diesel, and it is a mix of 5 buckets of Light Fuel with 1 bucket of Heavy Fuel, turning into 6 buckets of Diesel that each have a higher fuel value than the fuel used in LV.%n%nTo automate this from regular Oil, you will need another Distillery and Chemical Reactor, and finally a Mixer to put the fuels together. There are other possible sources of Heavy Fuel, mentioned on another quest in this chain, which can be of assistance if the input of Oil into the setup isn't very high. You will also need more Hydrogen, so get on it!

# Quest: Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtw.name=Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtw.desc=Finally, the oil of the gods. At least, early gods.%n%nDiesel, as a power source, has widely been known as the optimal choice all the way up to EV, when you unlock the ability to make nukes. It can be further upgraded into Cetane-Boosted Diesel in HV, by adding another chemical chain to it, but a fuel value of 480k EU on a fuel that needs so few machines to be made is quite exceptional. It should be automated as soon as possible, to ensure that you won't run out of power when you need it the most.%n%nAt this stage, you can use either LV or MV Diesel Generators. Using the LV ones will mean you need to make more of them, and more pollution, but they have 95%% fuel efficiency compared to MV's 90%%. It's a difference, but an automated Diesel setup is unlikely to be affected by a 5%% change in efficiency.%n%nAs you progress, fuel will become more and more power-dense, but also need more steps automated. The next tier is much harder than this one, so get ready!

# Quest: More Oil Options
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuA.name=More Oil Options
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuA.desc=Alongside the Oil Drilling Rig, there are other sources you can explore. For Heavy Oil, a good source might be Oilsands Ore, which is found in rare veins at high altitudes. If you find one, you will have a large amount of Heavy Fuel to make Diesel with after processing.%n%nThere are also renewable sources of Oil, namely from IC2 crops and bees. The Oilberry crop can produce it indefinitely, but at a very slow rate, whereas bees can do it much faster, particularly Refined Bees, but they are much harder to obtain.%n%nYou can also get more out of the Oil by cracking it in specific ways. Lightly Hydrocracked Heavy Fuel, for example, gives 60%% of the input amount as Light Fuel, which can be helpful if you have an excess of Heavy, and not enough Light to make Diesel.

# Quest: Using All the Fractions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuQ.name=Using All the Fractions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuQ.desc=After getting large amounts of all the oil fractions, what can you do with them? They'll pile up in the tanks or output hatches, and the Distillation Tower stop when it filles, unless you enable fluid voiding in the controller - in which case everything that cannot be output will just be voided instead, and it's in your best interest to avoid this waste. What do, then?%n%nFirst off, it's important to note that almost everything you get from Oil can be processed into even more things. Whether or not the step is worthwhile is a different story altogether. That said, you're free to look through NEI or the spreadsheet to decide what you want to do, and how you want to do it. The charm of a processing chain like this is that it lets you choose your own path and gives you the information to know how to best utilize it.%n%nSecond off, Oil is a major source of byproducts, many of which are needed to create various important materials. However, this isn't the only way to obtain most of them, and you might already found other sources, especially if you've dabbled in the Benzene or the Biomass chains. Which path you take is up to you.%n%nNow, for the four fractions that you get from regular Oil. Up until now, the power generation needed both Light Fuel and Heavy Fuel processing, and Refinery Gas already proved to be a good source of Ethylene. What can these be used for, in case you can build more DTs to process the cracked fluids? Roughly speaking, these are the possibilities:%n%nLight Fuel: You will most likely be using most, or all of this to make Diesel. If you do have leftovers, moderately hydrocracking it is a good source of Propene, and lightly hydrocracking is the best source for Octane. These two are important, but only in EV, for epoxy and powergen, specifically.%n%nHeavy Fuel: If only working with regular Oil, a lot of this will also be consumed to make Diesel. However, it's important to get more of it automated, since it can be distilled directly to make three fantastic byproducts: Toluene, Phenol and Benzene. All of them are important for progression, so make sure you pay attention to this recipe. Toluene is especially useful in HV, as you will need many buckets of it when making your first rocket to be able to get into EV.%n%nNaphtha: You could distill it in a Distillation Tower, but keep in mind that you need to build a max-height one to cover the entire recipe. However, if you do it, you will have most of the Oil byproducts automated meaning that it's worth it to tackle this challenge when you get comfortable with making lots of Stainless Steel; it also has a good burn value, so if you don't need these byproducts, best just use it for power.%n%nRefinery Gas: You're probably already distilling this for Ethylene. You could switch this recipe to a Distillation Tower and a Oil Cracking Unit (see next quest) to gain more output and some useful byproducts.

# Quest: Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALug.name=Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALug.desc=Another HV multi, and another Stainless Steel sink. Not only that, but it needs 16 coils to work! There is a quest about this multi in the Multiblock Goals tab, as per usual.%n%nDespite being expensive, this is an important multiblock to build. It does the cracking recipes like the Chemical Reactor does, and you might even be tempted to make an LCR for this purpose, since it's cheap and can do many recipes at once, but the Oil Cracker is much more efficient and gives several bonuses when used (check the tooltip for more information). As it stands, it's a higher initial investment that will pay off in the long run, many times over, and in this pack everything takes a long time, so get on it!

# Quest: Boosting the Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuw.name=Boosting the Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuw.desc=As you might have guessed, extra byproducts is not the only thing that HV does with Oil. On top of that, you can further improve the main fuel that you use for power, and this builds on the previous tier, as Diesel did from Light Fuel. As before, you will need to mix the fuel you have with something else to improve it, but it is not a direct byproduct this time. Instead, it's a chemical that requires a complicated processing chain to produce, at a much higher EU cost, with only a tiny amount needed to create the next fuel, Cetane-Boosted Diesel.%n%nTo make this additive, Tetranitromethane (TNM), you will need to source several chemicals you might have not used yet. I hope you have some Distillation Towers handy, because they will be very useful for this.

# Quest: Special Rubber from Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvA.name=Special Rubber from Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvA.desc=Another one of the Oil "specials" is Butadiene. It can be used in a few ways, including power, but where it shines is in making advanced rubber, specifically Styrene-Butadiene Rubber. You can make it in HV, but it is not required to have an improved rubber until the start of IV. There is a questline for this in the HV tab, so go check it out.%n%nThere is an equivalent alternative, Silicone Rubber, made from other inputs. They are mostly interchangeable, but they each have some unique use that makes it so you should have a good supply of both. 

# Quest: Distilled Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvQ.name=Distilled Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvQ.desc=You don't always have to crack the base fuels to get useful chemicals out of them. The best example of this is Heavy Fuel, whose recipe only has 3 outputs, but they're all excellent. This is the perfect format for a Distillation Tower automation, so get on it as soon as you can, you won't regret it!%n%nAs a sidenote, all of these are power-dense, and can be used for power if you stockpile a lot of them. Benzene is the first one you should use for this purpose, if you wish to do it, because the other two are core chemicals for required progression in HV and EV. However, Benzene can also turn into several useful chemicals, so don't burn it all for power.

# Quest: Acetone and Ethenone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvg.name=Acetone and Ethenone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvg.desc=Another ingredient in the making of TNM is Ethenone, which can be made directly from Acetone. This one is a little more organic, which is to say it's much easier to automate if you chose Benzene or Biomass. From those routes, you can get it from a Wood Vinegar DT, or reacting Acetic Acid with Calcite Dust from a Fermented Biomass DT (get the calcite from electrolyzing Fertilizer). If you used biomass to get Ammonia, you can do it this way.%n%nIf not using plants, though, there are other ways to automate this. Ethenone can be made directly from Acetic Acid and Sulfuric Acid, and this last one should already be automated from cleaning the sulfuric waste from the oil fractions. Acetic Acid, on the other hand, is a mix of Oxygen and Ethylene, a combo that you might have already automated to make Polyethylene. If not, this a good time to do so. %n%nThe amount of Ethenone you need to make a lot of Cetane-Boosted Diesel is small, so it's unlikely that you'll run out of Sulfuric Acid for this. Make sure you automate it all, though.

# Quest: Ammonia Source
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvw.name=Ammonia Source
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALvw.desc=One of the components of Tetranitromethane is Nitric Acid, which is made from Nitrogen Dioxide, and this from Nitrogen Oxide, which is ultimately created from Ammonia. You can do a small Chemical Reactor chain to do this line of recipes, but the better option is to make an LCR and use the circuit 24 recipe to turn Ammonia and Oxygen directly into Nitric Acid.%n%nYou'll still need to automate Ammonia, though, and there are two main ways of doing this. One of the options is to create it directly from Nitrogen and Hydrogen, but this recipe consumes a lot of EU. The other option is to switch to the biological side of things and get it from the DT recipe of Fermented Biomass, but this requires a whole another setup with sapling automation, a Pyrolyse Oven and some other machines, so don't do it unless you're interested in getting the other outputs of that recipe. It, however, might be a good option if you don't have those yet. Either way, automate your Ammonia.%n%n

# Quest: Tetranitromethane as Additive
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwA.name=Tetranitromethane as Additive
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwA.desc=If both Nitric Acid and Ethenone are automated, then you can now get TNM effortlessly!%n%nIf you look at the recipe, you'll see that you need a lot more Nitric Acid than anything else. Given that Ammonia is the most power-hungry recipe, this is what will cut down into the fuel efficiency at the end, but not nearly enough to discourage the creation and use of CBD. Not only that, but if you check the uses of TNM, you'll see that you can treat Biodiesel the same way, although at a higher cost due to its lower fuel value, if you happened to have it.

# Quest: Cetane-Boosted Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwQ.name=Cetane-Boosted Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwQ.desc=If you made it here, then you should be ready to make Cetane-Boosted Diesel flow into your generators by itself. Congratulations!%n%nOil is still the best power option in HV, building up from what you used in LV. This CBD you've made will help fuel your EBFs, get into space and then handle the increased power needs that EV will throw at you, especially if you want to make an AE2 network for quick automation. Your singleblock generators are at the lowest efficiency yet, 85%%, but the fuel you use now has a fuel value of 1 million EU per bucket, a very powerful liquid compared to any other you could make at this time.%n%nI'll see you on EV. Good luck when you make it there.

# Quest: Superpowered Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwg.name=Superpowered Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwg.desc=As did all tiers until now, the EV tier introduces a new type of bigger, better liquid fuel to burn on engines, High-Octane Gasoline. However, this one doesn't use the previous fuel, and instead takes a different oil-based route, which means that the CBD you have is of no use in this processing chain.%n%nAlso as before, the amount of processing you will need is greatly increased, and you can expect to need a lot more DTs, Oil Crackers, LCRs and other machines. You will also have to automate the input of materials from other sources, since Oil cannot provide you with everything anymore. You can overclock the multis you have, or build more of them, your choice. In the end, you'll have a fuel that is 2.5x more powerful than CBD, at an impressive fuel value of 2.5 million EU, and more byproducts than you could ever imagine. %n%nYou might have to crack one of the four oil fractions into the other ones, and you will surely need to pump Oil faster and faster to keep up with the power needs that will come when jumping to IV. I do recommend you use AE2 to automate the setup, relying on fluid P2Ps to transport fluids around, because it will make your life easier, even if it's harder to start and learn the setup. Either way you go, don't forget, you have to automate it.%n%n§4Work on making these important EV multis to continue.

# Quest: Boiler and Super Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALww.name=Boiler and Super Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALww.desc=With the advancements in building materials you've made until now, a new kind of generator has been unlocked. The Large Boilers you might have looked at before, and perhaps used, change when you reach Titanium, and if you build one of those, you will get something quite different from the tiers before.%n%nTo start, most burnable items don't work here. These advanced boilers need to burn much hotter, and as such they only accept specific fuels. The fuel of interest here is one of two, who are built in a sort of chain, in a similar fashion as to how Diesel and CBD worked. There is Solid Super Fuel, and Magic Solid Super Fuel, and they are both created from some coal-like block, some binder and some liquid fuel. You can use CBD for this, but Heavy Fuel and LPG are also options.%n%nWhy go through this route, though? The answer is that this extra processing, although it is difficult to automate, creates fuel that is much more efficient than the fuels that were put into it, and this is because the advanced Large Boilers are slow burners that output Superheated Steam, instead of regular one. This also means that they will need two turbines to convert all the steam into EU, and even more if the amount produced is too much for them. If fuel efficiency is something you're looking for, you can tackle this challenge and further process your CBD into something even more powerful.

# Quest: Improved Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxA.name=Improved Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxA.desc=Have you built an Oil Cracker? Have you checked its coils? This multi gets a significant discount to EU/t when upgrading the coils, but it caps at TPV, at a maximum of 50%% discount. If you are still using low-tier coils, this is a great time to upgrade them to Nichrome and enjoy a 40%% discount. You could also do TPV directly.%n%nBy the way, you can wall-share Oil Crackers, just like DTs, LCRs and many other multis, and doing this will save on the amount of coils you need!%n%n§3You only need to do one of the two tasks.

# Quest: Magic Super Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxQ.name=Magic Super Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxQ.desc=Solid Super Fuel is an excellent fuel to burn in the Titanium Boiler, but you can do something even better than that. With a touch of magic, you can make yet another solid fuel with 50%% more fuel value than the last one, but it's very likely that you will need Thaumcraft progression to automate this fully, should you wish to do so.%n%nIf you do want to do it, I recommend you also find a way to automate Coal, from IC2 crops for example, because the recipes that use it is much more efficient on liquid fuel than the other coals. You will also end up making more boilers, perhaps a quad Titanium Boiler, which will surely force you to increase the amount of Steam Turbines you'll have to make, but there is a catch here: you can screwdriver the turbines into Loose mode, which significantly decreases their efficiency but boosts their speed by something like 8 times, depending on the turbine you're using. Given that this process already boosts the efficiency of your fuels a lot, you may want to lose some of it to keep your number of turbines low.%n%nI'll leave the planning up to you.

# Quest: Raw Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxg.name=Raw Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxg.desc=At this point, you have almost all the additives needed to transform basic gasoline into the powerful HOG. What you'll need to do next is to create the gasoline itself, and this begins with Raw Gasoline. It has four different inputs, and each of them is sourced in a different way, but none of them are new: Naphtha and Refinery gas are well-known to you, Methanol was created in the previous quest and Acetone was explained in the "Acetone and Ethenone" quest in HV.%n%nAn important detail here is that Raw Gasoline is 80%% Naphtha. It can be obtained in large quantities from raw oil. If you are not pumping raw oil, you will most likely find the amount you get to be short. But this problem has already been solved! Your source of Octane, if processed in a DT as explained, will also crack the Light Fuel into a lot of Naphtha that you can use here to compensate for the low amount you get from Oil. If you get low on Light Fuel, you can also crack Heavy Fuel to get some.

# Quest: Pushing with Anti-Knock Agent
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxw.name=Pushing with Anti-Knock Agent
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALxw.desc=If you want your generators to last, you'll want to make this. In fact, since safety is always the priority, you can't make HOG without this Anti-Knock Agent, a mixture that keeps the fuel from damaging the engine even when it is this powerful. There are two paths to get this automated: one with an LCR recipe, and the other with a DT. The LCR option is cheaper to build, as per usual, but it consumes considerably more power than the DT path, so this quest will focus on the latter. As before, having an initial higher investment to save energy in the long run is the way to go.%n%nThe DT path is a cycle between a Mixer and the tower itself, where each distillation extracts a bit of Anti-Knock Agent from the MTBE Reaction Mixture, and will need to be mixed again. The two inputs needed for the setup are Butene and Methanol. Butene is obtainable from any of the max-height DT distillations, and Methanol from a mixture of Hydrogen and Carbon Dioxide/Carbon Monoxide. If you have a Fermented Biomass setup, you will already have CO2 ready to go, and Hydrogen can be sourced from a variety of ways.%n%nMake this cycle, and you'll have a safe fuel.

# Quest: Zooming with Nitrous
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyA.name=Zooming with Nitrous
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyA.desc=Nitrous Oxide, N2O, also known as nitro. It makes cars go really fast for short bursts. In reality, it is a source of extra oxygen when mixed in with the fuel during combustion, allowing it to be consumed faster and also release energy faster, but at the risk of "knocking", detonating the fuel out of its intended boundaries and possibly destroying the engine. %n%nTo avoid this, something else needs to be mixed in this HOG to prevent your generators from exploding, right? Luckily for you, such an option exists and it will be presented after this quest. For now, though, you can focus on automating Nitrous Oxide by mixing Nitrogen with Oxygen. These are the two main products of distilling air, so you can obtain them in one step, but you probably have chosen your source of these gases at this point, so use what you have.

# Quest: Speeding with Octane
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyQ.name=Speeding with Octane
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyQ.desc=One of the components of High-Octane Gasoline, as the name implies, is Octane. It is so important to improve the fuel because of something called "octane rating", which measures how much the fuel resists compression without detonating. The energy that vehicles get to move around comes from this detonation, but being able to apply more compression allows for engine designs that are more efficient, but need the fuel to resist that increased force without detonating. That said, any of these fuels can be run in the engines you use, so the way to represent this efficiency bonus is in the fuel value.%n%n(There is a multi in the next tier that only runs on HOG, though. Don't forget it.)%n%nHow is Octane obtained, then? In the last tier, it was explained as coming from Light Fuel, and this is still how you should, and can obtain it: lightly hydrocracked Light Fuel gives some Octane, so put a DT for it and leave your Diesel needs behind. It's time to move on.

# Quest: Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyg.name=Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyg.desc=Raw Gasoline is raw, obviously. To make it a proper fuel, it needs something explosive mixed in with it... what could you have that is considered explosive? Maybe the TNT, or what it's made of?%n%nYou have Toluene automated already, right? Get on it.

# Quest: High Octane Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyw.name=High Octane Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALyw.desc=Gasoline is a regular fuel, as I'm sure you know. Nothing special about it, it's the same as Diesel but with a different density, for different engines. In real life, it's incredibly useful for the average person, but in GTNH it's mostly replaced by Diesel. However, that is about to change.%n%nThis step is by far the most complicated one in the entire chain, but you already automated all the additives you need, so this is just a matter of mixing. This is the EV step, the final step, so put your chemicals together. Add Octane to help the fuel resist compression after putting in the explosive Toluene, mix in the nitrous to juice it up and finish by controlling it with Anti-Knock Agent. Mix this all with Gasoline and you have HOG, the most powerful diesel fuel in the game.%n%nThere is more progression to the oil processing, and more quests from here, but this is it for fuel improvements. What is left for you is unlocking, and building even better generators that can take full advantage of how powerful HOG is. Nuclear Power is likely to be your next step in power, as diesels cannot last forever, but you can still continue through this path.%n%nOh, and congratulations! You have earned this reward.

# Quest: Largest Oil Drain
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzA.name=Largest Oil Drain
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzA.desc=One way or another, you will need to get Oil faster. Reservoirs can get really big, but the rig only pumps from a portion of them... until now. With a few stacks of Tungstensteel, you can put together the tier 4 of the Oil Rigs, and suck up all the fluid from a reservoir at once, covering the full 8x8 chunk size from a single spot. %n%nIf you need even faster Oil input, build more rigs! They'll draw from the same pool, and exhaust it together. If you put them on adjacent reservoir chunks, you can draw multiple full reservoirs at once and feed them into a central location, and this transportation becomes even easier with Ender Tanks, which are unlocked in this tier.

# Quest: Buffered Dynamo
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzQ.name=Buffered Dynamo
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzQ.desc=Another use for a few stacks of Tungstensteel is a new, even more powerful generator, but you can't run it just yet. Just like the LCE before it, the IV generator can't be run without a dynamo hatch that is powerful enough to keep up with the output, and in this case it applies to both the boosted and unboosted modes.%n%nWhat that means is that you need an IV Buffered Dynamo Hatch. The power will be worth it.

# Quest: Extreme Combustion Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzg.name=Extreme Combustion Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzg.desc=Very similar to the LCE in most aspects, the Extreme Combustion Engine was created to close the gap between the diesels and more advanced forms of powergen, mainly nuclear fusion. However, the main thing they differ on is the fuel that they can run, and in this case you're limited to the powerful fuel from the last tier, High Octane Gasoline.%n%nThat's right, only this fuel will work, and in exchange the ECE will output more than 10k EU/t. If you add Liquid Oxygen, which you'll need 4 Vacuum Freezers for (3 at HV and 1 at EV), you can keep it boosted permanently, which will send it up to 4 IV amps of power and 150%% fuel efficiency. It's in your best interest to keep this thing going if you want to keep using Oil fuels for power, and the only thing you can rely on is your automated HOG setup, which you might have to, and should improve with the new IV multis as soon as you can, unless you have other sources of power working simultaneously.%n%nAs a last note, there is also an IV equivalent of the Vacuum Freezer, if you want to tackle the Liquid Oxygen needs that way. It's more power efficient, look it up on the GT++ tab.

# Quest: Super Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzw.name=Super Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALzw.desc=Your tallest and closest buddy, the Distillation Tower. You've relied on it so much, haven't you? It's time to take it down.%n%nNo, not really, but you can do better now. The catch is that the upgrade to this, the Dangote Distillus, is special in the sense that its crafting recipe is in the Chemical Plant, and the one you have to build for this recipe is very expensive. Should you decide to accept the costs, though, you can build a Dangote in much the same way as the DT, and even upgrade it to tier 2 for better performance (look in NEI for a Distillus Chip, you have to put it in the controller). %n%nIn summary, this multi runs faster than the DT by doing parallels, a recipe done multiple times at once. A quad DT that you were using to distill Oil can be replaced by a Dangote, and so on. Since distillation is usually a bottleneck in speed for oil processing, this multi should prove useful.

# Quest: Maxed Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0A.name=Maxed Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0A.desc=How many oils have you cracked at this point? No matter the number, you can do it cheaper. Once you reach HSS-G coils, you will have achieved the maximum EU/t discount of 50%% on your Oil Crackers, and enjoy the full array of benefits that they can provide you. Don't forget to overclock them if they're running slow, the energy cost is minimal at this point.

# Quest: Super Fuel At The Top
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0Q.name=Super Fuel At The Top
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0Q.desc=I was kidding, there's one more step in Oil, but it isn't really a better fuel, it's just the Tungstensteel Boiler.%n%nThis multi operates in the same fashion as the Titanium one. It needs a Super Fuel, it produces Superheated Steam and it makes you build a bunch of Steam Turbines to actually get power out of the fuel it consumes. The output energy of a single one of these boilers, at 100%% efficiency, is 16k EU/t, so you'll need many turbines per boiler. You can build them like that, if you wish to, but at this point the Loose mode on those turbines is really useful. The efficiency hit is big, yes, but the Tungstensteel Boiler is 300%% as efficient as the Bronze one, and a single Magic Solid Super Fuel burns for 4,5M EU at 100%% turbine efficiency. Look at the amount of CBD you need to make one super fuel, and then you can decide if you want to tackle this super finale.%n%nYes, it's the end, basically. There is a couple of things you can still do, but I'll give you this as an award for having pushed through essentially all the Oil content in the pack. It has been a long journey, and I hope that you found it worthwhile and enjoyable.

# Quest: Breaking the Mold
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0g.name=Breaking the Mold
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0g.desc=Welcome, o' Baron of Oil. For you who has completed the 5 questlines of oil processing, a new chapter awaits you.%n%nThe following quests are not guidelines on how to work with oil. In reality, they are meant for tiers where you're not supposed to be using this kind of power anymore. However, if you do want to continue it, and push it as far as it can go, the following are a few challenges that you can take on, mostly for bragging rights.%n%nAll these challenges are for the tiers after IV. Some of them are for LuV, others need further progression. Good luck!

# Quest: Ultimate Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0w.name=Ultimate Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL0w.desc=The Dangote Distillus is not enough for the goals of an oil baron. You might have heard about "mega" multiblocks, namely the Mega EBF, but did you know that a Distillation Tower equivalent exists?%n%nIt does the same thing as the Dangote, parallels, but it does 256 at a time, and is much, much bigger than anything you've built so far. My challenge to you is to build a max-height, full-sized Mega Distillation Tower, and come out of your efforts with the biggest multiblock that the pack has to offer. You will need more, much more casings than what the quest asks for, but your inventory is not big enough to hold the full amount that will need to build this monstrosity.

# Quest: Hyperheated Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1A.name=Hyperheated Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1A.desc=If there is someone who found themselves invested in the Large Tungstensteel Boilers, this one is for you. Through the pollution, the multiblock spamming and the chained processing lines you need to get here, you will find that this is a lot of heat for one boiler to handle. Why not make two quad boilers?%n%nYou might be thinking about the number of turbine multis you need to withstand this, but fret not! There are extra large turbines, for the extra large steam enthusiast. You will need twelve turbine items for each multi, and you best bring the best ones you can make! Loose mode is up to you, just go wild with your super fuel.%n%n§4You will need an Assembly Line to craft the dynamo needed to complete this quest.§r

# Quest: Universal Fuel Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1Q.name=Universal Fuel Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL1Q.desc=This is the most powerful combustion engine that has ever been built. In fact, it's not only that, but also a Gas Turbine and a Rocket Fuel Generator!%n%nThe Universal Chemical Fuel Engine burns fuel with some additives, as did its predecessors, but it runs at a lower efficiency. The 150%% value is a mathematical limit, you cannot reach it without supplying infinite fuel, but this engine compensates by running as fast as fuel is input into it, without the maximum EU/t limitation the others had. The only two things you have to make sure of are that you supply enough Combustion Promoter to keep efficiency up (I'll let you figure the best ratio on your own, but 1:4 promoter:fuel is decent), and that the dynamo can support the EU/t that the generator is outputting.%n%n§9§9§b§4You will need an Assembly Line to craft the dynamo needed to complete this quest. You better burn enough HOG to make it worth!§r 


## Quest Line: Bio for the Masses
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFQ.name=Bio for the Masses
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFQ.desc=Questline about powergen that comes from plants and trees.

# Quest: Renewable Energy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFA.name=Renewable Energy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFA.desc=Despite finding oil spouts in the wild, you might have thought about extending the source of power you have used to reach the age of electricity. Steam was your energy, and burnable items your source of that energy, with wood and charcoal being the most likely candidates for automating your first power generation steps. Steam itself, however, is not the best option for all progression tiers, so the question is: what else can that wood do? That is what this questline will explain.%n%nEach tier you reach will challenge you with bigger power needs. Not only do the energy tiers multiply by 4 every time you go up (32 EU/t for LV, 128 for MV, 512 for HV, etc.), but also the necessary growth of your setups, with more steps and each one becoming more complicated. To sustain all this, you might want a fully automated, infinite source of power and chemicals to handle this pack's progression. To achieve this, following the quests in this chapter is sure to be helpful.%n%nAs a final note, the power outputs of a fully renewable powergen like this are not as efficient as oil, which is the price to pay for being renewable. You will need a bigger machine setup to achieve the same EU/t output, but it is still very viable and worth it if you are willing to make this compromise. On the other hand, building these wood-related setups will give you some interesting chemicals to use in later crafts, chemicals that oil cannot directly create. You can choose one or the other, or just follow both paths at the same time if you're curious. It's up to you.

# Quest: Carbon, Chemically
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFQ.name=Carbon, Chemically
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFQ.desc=How does all of this organic stuff produce energy, anyways? You burn it, that's how! The heat from that burning heats up water into Steam, and this can make a Steam Turbine spin, generating rotational energy that can directly be converted into electricity with spinning magnetic fields. Pretty neat, right? The wood/charcoal provides the combustible material, and the atmosphere provides the oxygen to keep the fire going. With some chemistry, and GTNH magic, we can use these principles to generate power in an alternative way.%n%nIt's pretty much magic, really. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a valid fuel for Gas Turbines, and it can be made with Charcoal and Oxygen. The CO has more power than the Charcoal used to make it, but the additional Oxygen will make this step not worth it if you get it from electrolyzing water or centrifuging air, since the EU needed for those crafts will make this process inefficient. There is, however, a more efficient way to automate Oxygen production, but you will need crops for it.%n%nYour target is Sugar, since electrolyzing it will output Oxygen at almost 1000 EU per bucket. Each bucket of CO produces 24000 EU, made from one Charcoal that produces roughly 16000 EU in Steam, and costing 560 EU per craft. The whole process gives around 6000 EU of free power per Charcoal, around 30%% extra power overall!%n%nTo get automated Sugar from crops, you want Sugar Beets. Sugar Canes do the same thing, but with more EU cost to get the Sugar. There are other possible ways but, for now, just get loads of Sugar.  

# Quest: Burning the Carbon
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFg.name=Burning the Carbon
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFg.desc=If you've automated Carbon Monoxide, you can now burn it directly for EU in a Gas Turbine. It does not use the Steam Turbines that the boilers required, which is a good thing for two reasons: Steam Turbines are less fuel efficient than their Gas or Combustion alternatives, and steam in itself needs large pipes to move it, being much less power dense than gases or diesels. Additionally, you don't even need boilers at all! You can skip them altogether if you invest in this CO route.%n%nYou also get Ashes from this chemical reaction. They can be used in several ways, take a look!

# Quest: Sourcing Your Wood
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFw.name=Sourcing Your Wood
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFw.desc=When it comes to power from wood, your only options so far have been the wood itself and Charcoal. Both of these are low on energy per item, so you will need a lot of wood to have a decent EU/t output. How, then, can you easily get that much? There are two ways: the automated way, and the non-automated way.%n%nThe automated way can be done with one of several machines, but in LV you only have one option: the LV Crop Manager. It can automatically harvest crops in an area around it and, for this situation, the crop you want is one of several Bonsais. You can get them by planting saplings on cropsticks (there is a lot more information about how crops work in the Forestry and Multifarms page), and most types of saplings are equivalent to one another, although not all of them can be planted as crops. The ones that stand out are Spruce, which give a bit more wood than the others, and Oak, which give Apples alongside the usual wood and saplings, possibly useful for some chemistry later.%n%nThe non-automated way can be done earlier, and it only requires two things: an unbreakable Lumber Axe and trees with a lot of wood, like Sacred Oak, Redwood, or Rainforest Oak. This axe will chop down (most of) the trees and award you with stacks and stacks of wood, much faster than the automated way, but with more work. This process might be useful in the beginning, but you will have to automate the wood input at some point. %n%nComplete one of the tasks and get some wood to continue. 

# Quest: Faster Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGA.name=Faster Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGA.desc=Even if you have more wood, this won't help your power issues that much. Using it directly as fuel isn't going to do much for you as you move forward, and turning it into Charcoal will be very important. You have already built a Coke Oven, maybe more than one, but each one takes 90 seconds to produce one Charcoal, an abysmal rate. Unfortunately, there isn't any faster option in this tier, so you will have to build more of these ovens. How many, exactly?%n%nThere are many different goals you might want to go for, but a good metric for your power needs is a setup with 24 Coke Ovens. This number will create both Charcoal and Creosote Oil at a rate that will run two max-sized LP (Low Pressure) Railcraft Boilers, one solid and one liquid, with the quest for those coming right after this one. If you automate this entire setup, it will produce around 2 amps of MV, which are equivalent to 8 amps of LV, plenty of power for this tier and enough to advance you to the next one.%n%nAfter building these Coke Ovens, you will need to automate them. There are a few ways to do this, but one of the cheapest ones is to use Item Pipes, made with Tin for example, with a Conveyor Module in the wood chest/drawer to put the wood in the ovens, and then one Hopper below each oven, into more Item Pipes, to gather the Charcoal. The Creosote is a bit harder to extract, but you can do it with Tinkers' Faucets on the side of each Coke Oven, with a Wooden Fluid Pipe directly under the faucet. You will need to keep reactivating them with redstone, which means you'll also need a redstone clock (there's a block dedicated to this purpose, named Redstone Clock, from Extra Utilities).

# Quest: Two Big Ovens
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGQ.name=Two Big Ovens
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGQ.desc=With 24 Coke Ovens automated, you can sustain two big boilers endlessly. The boilers you want to build for this are specifically the Low Pressure Railcraft Boilers, made with Iron, each one as big as they can be, a 3x4x3 of the Boiler Tanks. These multiblocks are expensive, but you will have plenty of power and will consume all the Creosote from your Coke Ovens to keep them running permanently.%n%nThese boilers have a High Pressure variant, though, which need a lot more steel than their cheaper counterparts but can output a lot more Steam. If you somehow gathered a lot of stacks of Steel Ingots, you might think of attempting this, but keep in mind that your Coke Oven setup cannot sustain the input those heated behemoths require to keep running. The same goes for the Large Bronze Boiler, GregTech's own way of improving on your tiny boilers, but with two added problems: you can't produce Charcoal fast enough for it (the output speed of your setup is 3.75 seconds per Charcoal, the LBB needs one every 2 seconds), and it has a terrible efficiency for your Creosote, which means most of its power will be wasted. §6And perhaps, the LBB is MV-gated by circuit, compared to the boiler who is early-LV because of steel.§r%n%nHowever, surprise! The GT++ Semifluid Generators work, and they're very efficient with the Creosote. You can use a few of those coupled with a Large Bronze Boiler, but you will still run into the issue of not producing Charcoal fast enough unless you do something about it. You can choose this as an option and complete this quest, but it's a more "experimental" alternative.

# Quest: The Benzene Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGg.name=The Benzene Tier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGg.desc=Having walked into MV, you are soon going to be able to produce and consume Benzene. It's more efficient than burning the Charcoal in a boiler, but you will still need to provide a lot of wood to make sure you have consistent, abundant power. It's heavily recommended that you automate this wood input, if you haven't already, possibly with an MV Crop Manager instead of the LV one, or with the Crop Harvester from IC2. %n%nFor automation, you're still stuck with using bonsais, not regular trees. HV will provide a few options that don't need crops, but for now you might want to increase your crop stats by crossbreeding. Planting saplings on cropsticks creates 1/1/1 bonsais, which are much slower than their high-stat variants. If you want to invest in crops, you can later use the high stats to get more of a several dozen different items that crops can output, but you should start with Stickreed to develop your crop stats, not bonsais.%n%nDon't throw away your saplings, either! They will be useful later on, so save up as many as you can.

# Quest: Biodiesel Alternative
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGw.name=Biodiesel Alternative
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGw.desc=Trees are not the only source of power for the renewable enjoyer, though. You can continue to expand your wood production to sustain yourself, but you can also avoid the Charcoal business altogether! There are some naturally-sourced, energetic oils that can be processed into a greener alternative of what oil pumping can lead you to, in this tier. While crude oil turns into Diesel, this oil turns into Biodiesel! %n%nIn general, Biodiesel has less power per bucket than Diesel, which is its main drawback, to compensate for the renewable sources. You could source both of them from plants, but Oilberries are very slow compared to the option you might use, Rape flowers or Goldfish. They are an excellent source of Seed Oil or Fish Oil, but they are also IC2 crops, so their output scales with their stats. %n%nBetween the two, Goldfish have a faster fluid extraction recipe, so they are often recommended for that reason, although it's not a dealbreaker. It's recommended that you get high-statted crops if you want to follow this route, although it is not a necessity, because there are other options that never go into these IC2 crops.%n%nHow many options are there, really? There are many, but they can be divided into 3 categories, and that's what the quest tasks focus on: IC2 crops in a Crop Manager, regular crops in a Multifarm or automatic fishing in a fish trap. All of them are sources of a biological oil, either Seed Oil or Fish Oil, which can then be processed into Biodiesel.

# Quest: The Two Alcohols
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHA.name=The Two Alcohols
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHA.desc=The other fluid that mixes in with one of the natural oils to create Biodiesel can be one of two siblings: Methanol and Ethanol. They're very similar, both alcohols composed of carbon atoms surrounded by hydrogen ones, with one OH at the end. They often come from the same source (for example, running Wood Vinegar or Biomass through a Distillation Tower), but they also have some differences. To produce them from simpler elements in a Chemical Reactor, you'll need MV tier, which is where you are at. %n%nCheck NEI for all the recipes you can use for either of these. You only need one, so choose which of the quest tasks you want to complete. The one you're likely going to produce is Methanol.

# Quest: Extracting the Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHQ.name=Extracting the Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHQ.desc=Each option generates a different amount of oil, but this should be the limiting factor in your Biodiesel production regardless of which you choose. This step is always slow, for better or for worse, so your job is add more plants or more fish to the system. You might get byproducts, especially with fish, so deal with them accordingly. %n%nYou can upgrade the setup you have when you get to the next tier, or switch what you're using later. Either way, get some oil.

# Quest: Biological Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHg.name=Biological Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHg.desc=Reacting the three chemicals from the steps before with each other, you get a highly energetic fluid that is, for most purposes, equivalent to Diesel. To burn it for power, you cannot use Steam or Gas Turbines, but instead the Combustion Generators that Diesel also uses. They are reasonably efficient, generating 90%% of the EU shown in NEI per bucket of fuel, although Biodiesel has a lower fuel value than either Benzene or Diesel, but not by much. Besides the generators, you also need a big enough fuel input per tick to sustain your base, so make sure to expand your setup enough to fuel all of your other automations.%n%nBiodiesel isn't the only thing you get from this process, though. As a side product, you also get Glycerol. Do not throw this away, it will prove itself useful when making epoxy resin, and possibly in other setups, to save you some work at a later time. When using singleblock Chemical Reactors, the recipe will stop if the Glycerol output is full, a situation in which a super tank will surely come in handy. %n%nWith that said, HV holds a big upgrade to this fuel that you might want to invest in. Keep progressing to check it out!%n%n 

# Quest: Advanced Coke Oven
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHw.name=Advanced Coke Oven
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHw.desc=Your power needs quadrupled since the last tier, and it's likely that you're not getting Charcoal fast enough. Instead of adding even more Coke Ovens, why not build an upgraded version of them?%n%nThe caveat is that you won't keep producing Creosote alongside the Charcoal from now on. It makes for decent power in the appropriate generators, and you might have already used it to produce Lubricant. Despite that, you can still get Creosote from processing in the next steps of this questline, so you can still get it if you need it. With that out of the way, let's move on to the Advanced Coke Oven (ACO).%n%nHow is it made? The ACO needs a lot more steps than the normal Coke Ovens, steps centered around Nether materials, cooked in the EBF and then cooled down. The cooling part is normally the Vacuum Freezer's job, as you will see later in progression, but you can't build it yet; because of that, you'll have to use IC2 coolant to finish the bricks used in the ACO. Once you've crafted all the blocks needed for this, you can put it together and start it up, to see what's different from before.%n%nThe speed of this new one is 1 Charcoal per second, or the equivalent to 90 Coke Ovens. The cost of this is the loss of the Creosote, and also that it needs fuel to work, making it so approaximately 1/16 of your Charcoal is lost in this step. Fortunately, you can automate it with item pipes, and the EnderIO conduits make it even simpler. Input wood, input charcoal, output charcoal.%n%nMake one of these multis to continue. Be warned that you might need more!

# Quest: Pyrolyse Oven
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIA.name=Pyrolyse Oven
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIA.desc=Some setups really demand space in your base to work properly. You might have thought that when you finished the Coke Oven automation, but there's also an option in this tier that respects that need for speed by just being a gigantic multiblock: the Pyrolyse Oven.%n%nIn essence, it's the original GregTech large-scale wood processor. It is a massive structure, probably bigger than any other multi you've build before, but it uses simple materials like bronze and steel. If you're able to just throw stacks of those at a controller, you can put this behemoth together and enjoy an alternative to the Advanced Coke Oven that has some extra benefits. Unlike any of the other ovens, this one runs on EU, so you need to route your power back here to process the wood you're feeding it. %n%nWhat makes the Pyro valuable? It outputs a fluid alongside the Charcoal, which you can process for extra power and/or byproducts. Look at NEI to see all the alternatives available to you, this multi can usually output several different fluids, but only one at a time, decided by the circuit inside it. The one to choose at this time is Wood Tar, the same fluid you're extracting from the Charcoal. You get a small constant bonus from having built a Pyro, which is really nice.%n%nHowever, the Pyro uses coils in a similar way to the EBF, and those coils affect the time each recipe takes: if you're using Cupronickel Coils, the recipe time is actually 2x what NEI says! This might be too slow for your needs, so make sure you check how much Charcoal you're getting from here. Kanthal Coils are available in MV, using the IC2 Coolant instead of the Vacuum Freezer.%n%nYou can also boost your Pyro by providing Nitrogen. There are separate recipes for that in NEI.

# Quest: Large Steel Boiler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIQ.name=Large Steel Boiler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIQ.desc=Direct Charcoal consumption is also improved, if you want to go that way. The second Large Boiler is made out of Steel, but needs HV circuits, which you can make in this tier by using Polyethylene in the circuit boards. It generates steam at a speed equivalent to 1000 EU/t at 100%% fuel efficiency for that steam, which you can't reach with the inefficient Steam Turbines available to you. It also needs two ACOs, but it skips any further processing, at an additional cost of heavy pollution that you'll have to deal with in some way.%n%nThis is the most "spammable" setup you can make. There are no further upgrades to the Large Boilers that accept these cheap fuels (the next boilers only accept some more complicated ones), but you can wallshare these to increase the energy input into your processing. The biggest problem, as usual, is transporting the steam to prevent big energy losses across long stretches of cable. This is not the best option, but it can be used.

# Quest: Wood Tar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIg.name=Wood Tar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIg.desc=Benzene cannot be extracted directly from Charcoal. To get to it, you need to process the extracted fluid, called Wood Tar. In the past, this was a very slow step, which forced players to spam Fluid Extractors to keep up with the other parts of their Benzene line, but it's a lot faster now. Regardless, you still need more than one Fluid Extractor for each machine used in the step after this one, if you are using LV machines here. %n%nSince it's an LV recipe, you can overclock it with an MV machine, but you'll waste some EU that way (each recipe will cost twice as much EU). To continue, craft either 2 LV Fluid Extractors or 1 MV one.

# Quest: The Most Powerful Biodiesel 
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIw.name=The Most Powerful Biodiesel 
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIw.desc=If you've been working with renewable diesels before, you might want to upgrade them further. Instead of just duplicating your existing setup, you can upgrade Biodiesel to Cetane-Boosted Diesel (CBD), with a specific additive called Tetranitromethane (TNM). You'll get more bang for your buck if you upgrade to this fuel, instead of just making more Biodiesel, since it has 3x more EU per bucket, and the TNM is needed in small quantities. Before you start working on the new setup, though, it's important that you increase the amount of Seed/Fish Oil you're making, and in turn the items that turn into those oils. %n%nAs before, you can use IC2 crops, regular crops/trees or fishing. For IC2 crops, you can use the Multifarm set to IC2 crop mode, which needs HV-gated Uranium Electron Tubes but automated more than 1000 crops while being very conservative with power and fertilizer, or the HV Crop Manager. For normal crops/trees, use the EnderIO Farming Station, also unlocked in HV. For fishing, you don't have new tools, you can only add more Fish Catchers or use Goldfish IC2 crops if you're oriented that way.%n%nTo complete this quest, make a Multifarm, a Farming Station or some Fish Catchers.

# Quest: Trees Growing Faster
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJA.name=Trees Growing Faster
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJA.desc=No matter which way you used to get wood, you can simplify it. There's nothing much simpler than just pulling out more and more wood from a multiblock that doesn't even grow trees! That's what the Tree Growth Simulator does, with a special input: saws. This multi can replace the bonsais that were used for wood automation, however it is only available in IV. You have two further options in the mean time:%n%nTo continue using bonsais, in case you have gotten good stats on them, you can use the HV version of the Crop Manager, or the multiblock version, the Multifarm. This multi is special because it needs Uranium Rods, which are HV due to needing Eyes of Ender, but it has a massive range to harvest crops, being able to work with 1000+ of them, while only consuming 6 ULV amps when built correctly. It also hydrates and fertilizes automatically, and is much more efficient with the Fertilizer than its competition. Compared to the Crop Manager, it only loses out on the extra drops per harvest.%n%nOther than these two options, you can also grow and harvest trees normally with the EnderIO Farmer, which is a more typical tree automation machine. It's HV-locked like and it's simple, reliable and only needs a bit of power to get the wood you need, at a pretty fast rate. Ideally you want to use an unbreakable lumber axe with a tree type that produces a lot of logs (spruce is decent). To crank out a lot of wood you can then use sprinklers with water or a world accelerator.

# Quest: Sapling Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJQ.name=Sapling Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJQ.desc=Wood has been a big part of your power generation, and you might have even used other plants or fish for oil. Even if that's true, there is a constant output from your trees that has been left unused all this time: the saplings! No matter which tree you chose to automate, you are surely stockpiling the saplings matching that tree, since there's little that is really useful to do with them. At this point, though, you can set up a decent Biomass setup.%n%nTo clarify, Biomass is just a fluid made from plant stuff. It doesn't need to be saplings, but that's most likely something you have a lot of lying around. On top of that, there are multiple types of Biomass, one of them called Fermented Biomass, which is very similar but different, and the recommended path for you to take, since it needs less steps than the alternatives and gets you to the DT recipe just fine.%n%nAfter this processing line is finished, you will have a lot of new chemicals automated that you won't have from Wood Tar alone. If you are already processing Wood Vinegar, you will have several repeat outputs, though. That said, if you complete this line, you will get Ethanol + Methanol and Ammonia, which make the Cetane-Boosted Diesel process much easier. All of these lines interact with each other, and you can get bigger and bigger returns if you automate several at once!%n%nFor now, focus on putting together the machines needed to get from Saplings to Fermented Biomass. You will need a Compressor, a Pulverizer and a Pyrolyse Oven for this route.

# Quest: Fractioned Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJg.name=Fractioned Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJg.desc=One of the most important steps is to remove the limitation you had when distilling. Wood Tar turns into Benzene? That's not how it should be, there's much more to get from that tar than what you've been extracting from it. To keep the rest, you need more space in the distillation process, or, more specifically, more height. Each of the fluids that can be separated from within the tar will stick at a different height level, sitting on top of all the others that are more dense than itself.%n%nBasically, you need a multiblock, instead of a singleblock. The Distillation Tower you will need for this recipe has to be at least 6 blocks tall, with 1 input plus 5 outputs. Out of it, you will get Benzene, Toluene and Phenol, which are all viable gases for power alongside being very useful for progression (Toluene for compressing with TNT and moving past HV, Phenol for crafting circuits in the next tier and other chemical lines). You will also get various types of Dimethylbenzene. For now the only one of interest is 1,2-Dimethylbenzene which is a part of the PBI line in IV. Though even that is unfortunately of little use to you right now. You also get Creosote for your Lubricant needs, or a little extra power.%n%nThe Distillation Tower will continue consuming Wood Tar, even if one or more outputs are full: it'll just void the rest! Other than Dimethylbenzene, everything else can be used for power, so try not to waste those things. 

# Quest: Creosote's Work
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJw.name=Creosote's Work
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMJw.desc=Your old pal, Creosote Oil, is back in the game! That's right, you can get it automatically from Charcoal processing again, as you did with the first Coke Ovens, and what you can do with it is about the same. The two main purposes it has are power generation and Lubricant, which you will want to use in Cutting Machines, and will also be required in some later multiblocks like the Large Combustion Engine and the Multiblock Miner. Using a Brewery, you can add some Redstone to quickly convert this oil to Lubricant and keep it in stock for whatever machine or craft needs it.%n%nAlternatively, you can get a bit of extra power from this. The fuel value per bucket is much lower than the big three, but it still has an interesting use. When the semifluid generators were broken, and the Creosote wasn't usable in them, there were setups using two max-size LP Railcraft boilers to turn the amount you get from one DT into the EU needed to run it, making that step completely free in terms of power. There were some fine details, such as the Steam Turbines needing to all be LV for the fuel efficiency, but it'd be easier to use semifluid generators from the start. Either way, you can at least remove the EU cost from the DT from the equation, if you wish to.

# Quest: Phenol's Width
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKA.name=Phenol's Width
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKA.desc=This one is not as specialized as Toluene is. It's also more likely that you will be producing it in a Chemical Reactor, or working around it with recipes, if you choose not to use Oil or Benzene for some reason. You're here, though, so you have all of the possibilities, and all of the advantages of skipping through steps in several important chemical lines that accept Phenol, one of the first being epoxy resin. If you check NEI, you can more easily see where this chemical can come in handy.%n%nIt is true, though, that it isn't as required in HV as Toluene is. Since both of them are good power options alongside Benzene, it's preferable that you burn this one for power between the two, if you have to. In the best situation, you won't need to, but it's also acceptable to burn all of the Benzene and some Phenol, while the Toluene gets converted into its gelled form to make several stacks of TNT. Don't discredit the amount of power you can get from this.

# Quest: Toluene's Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKQ.name=Toluene's Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKQ.desc=Trinitrotoluene. Shorthand, that's TNT, or one of the most popular types of explosive there is. Not only is it popular, but it's a centerpiece of a special type of GTNH crafting: implosion compressing! There are other types of explosives available, but TNT is the best for this purpose.%n%nThat's all fine and dandy, but unfortunately it is not optional. To get past HV, you will need Titanium, and the most reasonable way to accomplish that is to get it from ores found in the Moon, which will need a rocket made of very compressed plates, courtesy of a few stacks of said TNT. To source it, you will need a lot of Toluene, and from there you can make a choice: make regular TNT, or add Nitric Acid to the mix and come out with Industrial TNT, a more powerful version that can, for the most part, craft more items than the cheaper TNT. Some of the renewable powergen processes can output Ammonia, which makes Nitric Acid much easier to produce, so keep that in mind.%n%nToluene, plus TNT or iTNT is what you need. The rocket will thank you later.

# Quest: Further Charcoal Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKg.name=Further Charcoal Distillation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKg.desc=The Distillation Tower you've recently unlocked can bring forth many, many more outputs than what you've done so far. If you look at NEI, you might see that there are other Charcoal-related fluids that have recipes in this multi, and this is the time to work with them: doing it all in singleblock Distlleries would be very wasteful.%n%nThe most important part about getting these fluids is the Pyrolyse Oven. If you haven't made one, it's highly recommended that you make at least one. You can upgrade both the energy hatch and the coils used in it to keep it up to speed with everything else, no need to build more than one. Aside from fulfilling the purpose of the Coke Oven, to cook Wood into Charcoal, it gives the choice of which of several fluids it also outputs as it does the processing. Most of the options are potentially useful, but a complete Benzene setup will prefer Charcoal Byproducts because they are, essentially, the complete product.%n%nATTENTION: This setup is technically HV, but it's quite expensive. It's fine if you move to EV first before you build this. It is in no way required to progress in HV.%n%nWith Charcoal Byproducts, the full setup involves DTing that into Wood Tar, Wood Vinegar and Wood Gas, and then DTing all of those into their respective outputs. With one tower for each, you will end up with a quad DT setup, very expensive overall in terms of Stainless Steel, but with huge savings compared to making 4 separate ones. Keep in mind, however, that they will not all have the same height. Additionally, Wood Gas is not as valuable as the other two (although it is a decent Ethylene source), so it's also a good idea to make 2 of the 4 DTs process that, and burn the Wood Gas for the little power it can provide.%n%nAs a final note, the towers do process things slowly. Add Distilleries, if you wish, to get specific outputs.

# Quest: Vinegar into Acetone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKw.name=Vinegar into Acetone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKw.desc=From Wood Vinegar, one of the useful outputs you can walk away with is Acetone. It's not very easy to craft, needing Calcium Dust and Acetic Acid, which needs Methanol or Hydrogen... instead of all that, you can get it right here, alongside some of the other chemicals in this family tree. %n%nWhat is it for, though? Simple: Epoxy Resin, Cetane-Boosted Diesel, Raw Gasoline and maybe some up-and-coming glue. Want it? Get it, it'll surely prove useful.

# Quest: Direct Ethylene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLA.name=Direct Ethylene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLA.desc=Wood Gas has a big portion of barely useful outputs, but also some hidden gems. The hardest one to get, arguably, is Ethylene, since it needs automated Sulfuric Acid alongside the Ethanol you're already getting. DTing Wood Gas is the main way to get Ethylene directly, without worrying about the acid, when it comes to renewable power. This make Polyethylene, an important plastic you've already worked with at this point.%n%nThe caveat is, of course, the small amount that you get in this recipe. Whether or not you set this process up is your choice, but it's generally useful, especially if your main Ethanol source is Wood Vinegar. 

# Quest: No Benzene Yet
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLQ.name=No Benzene Yet
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLQ.desc=This questbook page is supposed to explain the Benzene powergen line, but you might have noticed that you haven't made any Benzene yet. That's because the recipe path to get it from Charcoal has an MV recipe, and you can't just skip straight to MV with the small amount of steam you were using in the Bronze Age. %n%nThere are also other paths for renewable power in this page. They have similar sources, or the same source, but different processing lines, and the entire thing looks like a tree branch, with many different ways in which you can go. The Carbon Monoxide path is one example of this, and there are many more to come in the future.%n%nRegardless of which path you chose to get power from your Charcoal, you can now sustain an EBF comfortably and get power more efficiently. It's recommended that you move away from steam in the next tier, because you will need to transport too much of it to produce good amounts of MV power. Fortunately, you won't need steam at all!

# Quest: Green Nitric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLg.name=Green Nitric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLg.desc=One half of TNM is Nitric Acid, which has more paths to reach it than can be listed here. It's basically Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Oxygen merged together, and many compounds made from these things can lead you to Nitric Acid. How you get this is up to you, but it might be a lot easier if you already automated some Distillation Tower setups for other renewable resources.%n%nLet me explain. Nitric Acid can be made directly from Ammonia and Oxygen. O2 has many sources, and you should have already automated it, but Ammonia is harder to get: you either make it from Nitrogen Oxide and Dioxide, or you skip all that with a Fermented Biomass DT, which outputs Ammonia directly. That is the fastest way, if you already made that setup, otherwise you'll need to chain several reactions together.

# Quest: Green Ethenone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLw.name=Green Ethenone
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLw.desc=The other half of TNM is Ethenone. Once again, DTs can make this easier for you, but Ethenone is pretty simple to figure out: either Acetic Acid or Acetone can make it, both of which are DT outputs, but Acetic Acid also needs Sulfuric Acid to make it. %n%nAcetone is easier, but either way works. One important thing to understand is that you only need a small, tiny amount of Ethenone when compared to other chemicals. When working with Biodiesel, 200L of Ethenone are enough for 9000L of CBD, which is equal to 9 million EU at 100%% fuel efficiency. With that consideration, each bucket of Ethenone corresponds to 45M EU! Quite powerful, if I do say so myself. %n%nClearly, your bottleneck will be the Biodiesel and, in turn, the Seed/Fish Oil.

# Quest: Green Cetane-Boosted Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMA.name=Green Cetane-Boosted Diesel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMA.desc=Tetranitromethane is the additive you need to turn Biodiesel into Cetane-Boosted Diesel. Each bucket of the first turns into 0.9 buckets of the second, but if you look at the EU values per bucket of both, 320k turns into 900k EU, discounting 5.7k EU from the craft, a huge upgrade in power generation. The TNM only costs some thousand EU, the main difficulty is automating the input of all the materials, which shouldn't be too hard at this stage of progression. %n%nThe power density of this fuel is great, but it doesn't mean you'll have enough power to get to EV. What really matters here is the amount of plants or fish you can provide, since all the other items and fluids are basically additives when compared to the amount of oil you need. It's hard to match the speed at which crude oil can be obtained, but you can bring forth a lot of Seed/Fish Oil if you increase the size of those setups.%n%nThere are more possibilities for CBD in the future, if you want to move towards those.

# Quest: Fermented Biomass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMQ.name=Fermented Biomass
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMQ.desc=After this biomass leaves the Pyro, you can input it straight into a DT and it will be separated into its component parts. This is one of the tallest towers that you can make with fully renewable powergen and, sadly, not all outputs are useful. However, you'll still get a nice bang for your buck, if you manage to not get lost in NEI in the middle of all this chemistry.%n%nThe following quests will explain some important uses for the outputs of this DT recipe. First, however, you need to get it going, which means you need a lot of Fermented Biomass and a tall enough tower to process it. There is one caveat that you might run into as you try to speed up your machines, which is that saplings don't come fast enough! You can work around this by throwing more plant stuff into the Compressor, and how you solve this is really up to you and what you have.

# Quest: Free For All Fertilizer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMg.name=Free For All Fertilizer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMg.desc=You might have heard of the Fertilia crop, which can easily automate the Fertilizer input for your crops, if you're using them. Why bother, though, when you're already getting it from your DT? That's right, you will also be able to automate fertilizing alongside everything else, which is very important for high-statted crops, making all the inputs (energy, water, fertilizer) automated without any outside inputs. Pretty neat, huh?%n%nThat said, you might not be using IC2 crops at all. In that case, you can electrolyze it, and you'll get a lot of free Carbon and Calcite Dust, which you'll certainly use in future chemistry. You can also use the CO2 Gas from the DT to get Carbon, I guess? It's not very useful.

# Quest: Methane Stinks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMw.name=Methane Stinks
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMw.desc=The output you'll get the most of, in the Fermented Biomass DT, is Methane. 6/10 of the input amount will become Methane, and this makes for the best choice for powering your powergen, even if other outputs can also serve as fuel options. It's important to remember that Methane is used in several important chemical lines, such as PTFE and Silicone Rubber, but you'll get much more of it than you need for those purposes.%n%nThe Methane you get from one DT can power it 4 times. Using 1/4 of your power there, you can fuel the singleblock machines you're using, and the wood automation source as well if you feel like it. Regardless, this setup should fuel itself just fine.

# Quest: Alcohols Here
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNA.name=Alcohols Here
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNA.desc=Ethanol and Methanol are two different chemicals, but they are both outputs from DTing Fermented Biomass or Wood Vinegar. Between the two, you can make Ethylene (and then Polyethylene, by adding Sulfuric Acid and Oxygen), Biodiesel, Dense Hydrazine (GT++ rocket fuel, it's very powerful in IV, try it), some chemicals for HOG (EV fuel from crude oil), and many other things such as Chloromethane. For future processing lines, you're going to want to have these stocked up. %n%nThey are both also power sources, if you end up with full super tanks. Their fuel values aren't the best, with Ethanol at 192k and Methanol at 84k, but they are perfectly capable of fueling your powergen setups, leaving your best fuels free to power your main base. Even if you're using them for Biodiesel and Polyethylene at the same time, it's quite likely that you'll have leftovers. If you have the choice to use any of the two in a recipe, choose Methanol, since Ethanol has a lot more EU per bucket to give.%n%n(Also note that you get almost no Ethanol from Wood Vinegar compared to Methanol. On the Fermented Biomass side, the amounts are the same.)

# Quest: Skipped into Ammonia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNQ.name=Skipped into Ammonia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNQ.desc=This one is almost a flex, at times, depending on your future plans. Ammonia is one of the most power-intensive early chemicals to produce, from Nitrogen and Hydrogen, with a slow HV recipe compared to most others being produced quickly. It is used very often, in various stages of progression, often to make Nitric Acid that is used for Industrial TNT, Cetane-Boosted Diesel and other products. From Fermented Biomass, you can get it directly, although only one tenth of the amount of biomass used, 1000 mL to 100 mL of Ammonia.%n%nThe rate at which you're going to get this, just from one HV DT, isn't very fast. DTs are slow by design, and the ratio for Ammonia isn't great, so you can accumulate it if you leave the setup running for a while, but you won't be able to feed it into multiple automations that require it unless you upgrade the DT or make more of them, both of which are easy to do later on. Alternatively, you can choose to void the other outputs and work with singleblock Distilleries instead, but this depends on the rate at which you're inputting saplings. %n%nTo note, Ammonia is required to make Cetane-Boosted Diesel, which you can make from Biodiesel. You can great a good mileage for that just from one Fermented Biomass DT.

# Quest: Sodium Hydroxide
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNg.name=Sodium Hydroxide
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNg.desc=The Biodiesel needs a bit of powder magic. In reality, this powder is another chemical that this chain uses, Sodium Hydroxide, NaOH. The bad part is that you can't continue without making this, but there's a boon to this: you only need a little bit of it, around 1 dust to make 45 buckets of Biodiesel. %n%nUnlike in the other steps, you can probably get away with batch crafting this instead of automating it, and still have consistent power from this fuel line. One stack of this dust is enough to make more than 100 million EU's worth of power, as long as the other fluids are automated. Given that, you can forget about it for a long time, but not forever. If you choose to not automate it yet, make sure you check it from time to time.%n%n(This can be automated from Salt Water, which can be automated from Tearstalks, a specific IC2 crop. You get Chlorine and Hydrogen as well.)

# Quest: Upgrading Your Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNw.name=Upgrading Your Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNw.desc=Having moved another tier, you have unlocked another fuel upgrade! Luckily for you, it uses simple inputs, although the place in which you craft it is more expensive than usual. This time around, the bigger expense is by far the processing multiblock, and you will need several stacks of Titanium to put it together. %n%nGiven as much, this is not a task for the very start of EV. It's recommended that you automate your Titanium processing line before you attempt this, because the Chemical Plant is going to grind your manual patience otherwise. If you already have a lot of that, everything else should be much simpler.%n%n(You will need a lot more than a stack. This is just to get you started.)

# Quest: CBD Into Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOA.name=CBD Into Steam
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOA.desc=There are no more Diesel-related upgrades for the CBD. To continue using Combustion Generators, or the LCE, you can only make your setup bigger or upgrade energy hatches. There is, however, a more power-dense fuel that uses CBD in its recipe, but there's a catch: it's a solid fuel, to be used in steam boilers, which gives it advantages and disadvantages.%n%nEverything from this quest onwards is about those solid fuels. There are two versions, one with additional inputs over the other, and they both follow the same logic: they need to be converted to Steam, which is hard to transport, convert into EU and basically require the EV and IV Large Steam Boilers. However, the combination of these fuels and those boilers is much, much more fuel efficient than before, if you are willing to face the additional challenges in this kind of setup.%n%nHow does it generally go? If you already have CBD, you can get power from it by putting it directly in Combustion Generators. In this line, though, you need to automate Fuel Binder, add blocks of Charcoal, Coal or Coal Coke and then put the Super Fuel in a Titanium or Tungstensteel Large Boiler, where you get Superheated Steam. After that, you need a HP Steam Turbine multi, followed by a regular Steam Turbine multi, and the setup is complete. %n%nIf you want to continue, then you'll need at least one Titanium Large Boiler. Build one. 

# Quest: Industrial Coke Oven
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOQ.name=Industrial Coke Oven
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOQ.desc=Your EV endeavors might push you into a GT++ multiblock, despite most of those being IV-tier. This happens because the special alloys used to put them together need to be crafted in an Alloy Blast Smelter, which is IV, but the Industrial Coke Oven (ICO) does not!%n%nWhat does it do? It's in the name, it's a really fast Coke Oven. So fast, in fact, that it can replace a few dozen Pyrolyse Ovens. It actually takes its recipes from that multi, so you also get the additional fluid, such as Charcoal Byproducts, alongside the greatly increased processing speed. The caveat is that this multi needs both Titanium and Tungsten, although only a small amount of the latter. You can get that much from processing End Stone Dust, Ender Goo or Moon Dust. %n%nYou can also choose between two types of casings. One of them does 12x parallels and the other does 24x parallels, which means the multi can do that amount of recipes at the same time per craft, if it receives enough power to do so. Since they're both quite cheap, you should use the better casings.

# Quest: Mass Distilled Water
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOg.name=Mass Distilled Water
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOg.desc=Water is completely free, that much is obvious. Distilled Water, though? It's the same input, but it needs a machine to process it into this version, and you best not choose singleblock Distilleries to do this, because they are incredibly slow and will never keep up with your demands.%n%nThe obvious option is a Distillation Tower. The less obvious option is a Steam Turbine multi, which outputs Distilled Water that is supposedly piped back to where the steam is made. However, there are several steam producers that use regular water, so you can try that? The DT is the simplest and most direct option, though. 3-high is the minimum, so you have to build it like that. It doesn't need a lot of power, it will fill up a tank of any size over time since the water input is completely free.%n%nTo prevent it from running continuously, though, here's a neat trick, in case you haven't done it already: take the output hatch on the second layer, where the Distilled Water comes from, and put it directly above the DT controller. Then, put a Fluid Detector Cover on the bottom side of the hatch and a Machine Controller Cover on the top side of the controller, so that the covers are facing each other. Set the controller cover to "Disable with Redstone", and the DT will stop after the fluid tank you've chosen is full. When it gets full, the output hatch will get stuck with some water, and it will send a redstone signal that stops the DT.

# Quest: Nitric And Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOw.name=Nitric And Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOw.desc=Sourcing these two should be easy at this point. Overall, the easiest option for Sulfuric Acid is oil processing, but you can also make it from Sulfur Dust, which is so very common from ore processing.%n%nNitric Acid is a bit more convoluted, but you might have already automated it, since it's needed for Cetane-Boosted Diesel. Ammonia and Oxygen can make it, or Nitrogen Dioxide instead of Ammonia. You won't be able to do it in a single step, but a small line of Chemical Reactor, or their multiblock equivalent, will do it for you.

# Quest: Titanium Chemical Plant
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPA.name=Titanium Chemical Plant
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPA.desc=This is the difficult part in the whole process. The multi in which Nitrobenzene is crafted is the Exxonmobil Chemical Plant, also known as the Chemplant, and it is a gigantic 7x7x7 structure with 4 separate upgradable parts to it. Even worse, the outer structure uses multiblock Machine Casings, making the DT look cheap by comparison, and the inside needs a lot of the casings used to craft single blocks.%n%nThe difference between those is that the tier of the outer structure that you need is mentioned in the recipe you want to craft, and the tier of the inner structure is generally related to the EU/t of the recipe, minus one tier. This is because, like the EBF and the LCR, you can use 2 energy hatches, so this HV recipe can be made with MV energy hatches. Since the inner structure's tier decides the max tier of the hatches used in the Chemplant, you can make it out of MV machine casings, which use Aluminium.%n%nThe outer structure will still need many stacks of Titanium, so this is where most of your effort will go. Good luck.%n%n§3Technically, you could also make Nitrobenzene in a LCR instead of a Chemplant. But it is less energy efficient and dilutes your acid. That option was only added for those too weak to handle a Chemplant.

# Quest: Nitrobenzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPQ.name=Nitrobenzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPQ.desc=With the Chemplant finished, you can slap in the necessary hatches and automate this fuel easily. The Titanium gate really is the main obstacle to this improvement, since you can more than triple the power your Benzene can make with some cheap additions to it!%n%nAs usual, the cost of building the setup will pay off over time. In this case, it'll happen even faster than usual, given how cheap the setup is. Benzene doesn't go anywhere beyond this point, but you can grab this final upgrade and make a lot out of it. Check out the multiblock Gas Turbines, and add a good turbine into them, made of a material like Manyullyn or Shadow Metal.

# Quest: Coal Or Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPg.name=Coal Or Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPg.desc=The Super Fuels are blocks of burnable material, like Coal Blocks, which they need in their crafting recipe. It doesn't have to be Coal, though: you can do Coal, Charcoal or Coal Coke, and all of them make the same amount of Super Fuel. However, the amount of fluid fuel used changes based on which kind of block you used, which poses a problem.%n%n(We will ignore Lignite Coal, since it is by far the worst option. If you want to use it, dealing with the efficiency problem is up to you.)%n%nThe problem is this: the amount of EU you save by choosing Charcoal instead of the other two is less than the amount of EU that the additional fuel can make. Basically, the most efficient option is Coal Coke, then Coal, then Charcoal. The easiest option to automate is certainly Charcoal, which means this is a choice between ease of automation and fuel efficiency. Even if you use Charcoal, you will still get more EU from the final fuel than what you used as input.%n%nCoal can be automated too, though! There are many ways to do this, but the most popular way of automating items that aren't renewable by default is usually by using either IC2 crops or Forestry bees, both of which have their own renewable Coal. If you never made progress in either of those, keep in mind that they need time and effort to give you good results, but if you have, then they are great options to make this fuel even more efficiently. Naturally, you will then turn it into Coal Coke with Pyrolyse Ovens, ACOs or ICOs.%n%nStock up on either Charcoal or Coal Coke blocks to continue.

# Quest: Normal Or Magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPw.name=Normal Or Magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPw.desc=There are two different Super Fuels, not just one. The regular Solid Super Fuel (SSF) has a heat value of 100k, whereas the Magic Solid Super Fuel (MSSF) has it as 150k, or 50%% more EU per block. As you can guess, the second one is more valuable, and worth it to make, but it requires even more processing than the first one.%n%nThe good part is, you don't really need lots of Thaumcraft progression. You barely need any, if at all, because there are many ways to make the Magic Fuel Binder and the block itself, including some that don't use any Thaumcraft items. There are so many options that this quest won't ask for a specific one, and it is once again up to you to decide which to choose, if you choose the magic fuel at all. As a tip, Alumentum is not mineable like Diamonds, but it can be automated by throwing Charcoal Dust at a Cauldron, and it has a higher burn value than the inputs. Additionally, for Coal Coke, only the Alumentum option is available.%n%nBasically, the SSF has 3 steps: craft the binder, craft the solid block and craft the fluid. The MSSF has more steps: craft the binder, upgrade it to magic binder, craft the solid block, craft the fluid and then finish with the extra items. Choose your own path.

# Quest: Super Fuel And Boiling
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQA.name=Super Fuel And Boiling
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQA.desc=If you've gotten this far, you should be about ready to produce Steam at an alarming rate from this hyper-efficient fuel. Unlike the Combustion Generators and Gas Turbines, though, you need more multis in front of your Large Boiler. Since it outputs Superheated Steam, you will need two turbines: the first one outputs EU and regular Steam, and the second one takes it in and outputs more EU and water, to be reused in the boiler.%n%nThe multis don't do anything by themselves, they need a turbine inside the controller to run them, and the turbine's size and material decide what their preferred flow rate is, and the EU/t at that rate. Good materials in EV are Shadow Metal (from Thaumcraft) and Manuyllyn, in IV you can use Oriharukon. Steam Turbine multis usually have a lower EU/t value than Gas Turbine ones, which means that you might have to make more of each kind of multi. This depends on the amount of boilers you are using, which tier of boiler and also whether or not you are using loose mode (check the Steam Turbine quest for more details).%n%nFlow rates when using Steam are very high, as you can imagine. You will need huge GT pipes if you use that mode of transportation, but there is a better way: AE2 P2P tunnels, set to fluid mode, can teleport fluids from one multi to the next without caring for high flow rates. With all that taken care of, all you need is an EV Buffered Dynamo Hatch for each turbine, and your setup is complete!

# Quest: Bet On The Distillus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQQ.name=Bet On The Distillus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQQ.desc=IV brings forth GT++ multis, including an upgrade for the Distillation Tower, called the Dangote Distillus. In structure, it's exactly the same as the DT, but it uses a different controller that has a more complicated recipe. It needs more expensive items, and it's also locked to an IV Chemical Plant, which makes it a very expensive craft if it is the only use you have for that plant. %n%nThat said, it solves the issue of DTs being slow, and those are essentially the backbone of all of these renewable setups. How many quad DTs are you going to need for reliable IV/LuV power, I might ask? Just go for it.

# Quest: More Steam For Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQg.name=More Steam For Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQg.desc=The last of the Large Boilers is IV-tier, and it's the Tungstensteel version. In numbers, it beats all of the other boilers, both in EU/t and fuel efficiency, so it's a good idea to build one or more of these if you've been working on the Super Fuels. Each one will output Superheated Steam matching an EU output of 16000 EU/t, at 100%% fuel efficiency, or 24000 EU/t with 150%%. %n%nAlongside this, you should also work on automating the Magic Super Fuel, if you haven't already. It needs more inputs, but it's even more bang for your buck, the entire point of this fuel line! You will need automated Blazes and Endermen, preferably, unless you can automate the Thaumcraft version of the Magic Fuel Binder recipe. For the fuel itself, Alumentum can be done simply with Charcoal Dust in a Cauldron or Thaumatorium.%n%nThe dark blue towers might ask for a lot of Large Turbines to process all of the Steam, especially if you build a quad boiler setup. You can expect almost 11000 L/t of it as output, per boiler, so look at some of the turbines you can craft and check out how many you need. The quest after this one gives some suggestions for battling the potential turbine spam.

# Quest: Huge Turbines And Loose Mode
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQw.name=Huge Turbines And Loose Mode
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQw.desc=If you are invested in making good IV power from Super Fuel, you will need a lot of Turbine multis. Their EU/t at optimal flow is much too low for you to survive with only one or two. However, there are several things you should consider in regards to these turbines, and the fuel you're using.%n%nIn summary, this fuel is very, very efficient. Turbines can be made faster by losing some efficiency. You have more than enough fuel efficiency to spare!%n%nLet's review this in more detail. Turbines produce EU based on the flow rate of the fuel that they are consuming. Their optimal flow represents the highest fuel efficiency they can reach (140%% or 150%% for the good turbines in these tiers), but you can increase the flow beyond that point and still get a higher EU/t value. However, the fuel becomes less efficient. A good tradeoff, if you need it.%n%nSteam loses efficiency quickly if you do this, though. The right way to pull this off with Steam Turbines is to switch to Loose mode, a mode unique to them, which makes the optimal flow shoot way up at a considerable loss to fuel efficiency. The jump in EU/t is so high, however, that you can replace a whole squadron of turbines with just one or two, as you can see if you look at the turbine items' tooltips.%n%nEach setup has their own details, so you will have to work things out and make personal decisions about how you will manage the turbines. Just make sure to not let the EU/t value go beyond the maximum that the dynamo hatch can output, or you will have problems!

# Quest: Processing Array Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMRA.name=Processing Array Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMRA.desc=This one is technically an EV multi, but it's hard to find the amount of Tungstensteel you need for it at that tier. The Processing Array's only purpose is to receive singleblock machines that process materials, like a Macerator, Compressor, and many others. It can use up to 64 of one of those, and does their processing as if they were all running, allowing the inputs and outputs to be moved to one spot, and making a setup more compact and less laggy.%n%nFluid extracting Charcoal into Wood Tar is an example of a step that might want a Processing Array. Even though the recipe time isn't very high (much lower than it used to be), you can make it very fast with just one multi, even when using LV and MV machines to avoid wasteful overclocks. This applies to almost all kinds of processing, with the GT++ multis competing for the same role. Each of those is built differently, and has different requirements, so it's a good idea to check them all to see whether or not a PA is more worthwhile than they are.

# Quest: Distilling Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMRQ.name=Distilling Benzene
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMRQ.desc=From Wood Tar, you can selectively filter out the energetic Benzene to use as a power source. This tar is like a fluid equivalent of the Charcoal, and it actually has a lot of useful chemicals hidden inside: to separate them, the tar needs to be heated up to a temperature that will cause some of its components to evaporate, but not others. This is fractional distillation, and the singleblock Distillery, in this case an MV one, can recover only one of the outputs of such distillation.%n%nThere is something that is worth considering, though: Benzene is not the only useful chemical that can be gotten from Wood Tar. In HV, you can get all the outputs at the same time, but right now you can only choose one. Other options that you might want are Toluene and Creosote. The former can be used to make TNT, to do Implosion Compressor crafts, and the latter is useful to make Lubricant, if you ran out of it and are not using Coke Ovens anymore. 


## Quest Line: Powerful Nuclear Physics
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGg.name=Powerful Nuclear Physics
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGg.desc=A series of questlines dedicated to nuclear fission and fusion, both for power and useful items.

# Quest: Basis for All Reactors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSQ.name=Basis for All Reactors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSQ.desc=Nuclear energy is first available in EV. However, it comes in all shapes and forms, and it can be hard to choose one kind of setup to use amongst all of those that are available. To start this questbook page, this first quest will be a summary of how nuclear power can be produced, and when it is available. Other quests down the line will have more details about each specific setup, but this is an overview of all of them.%n%nTL;DR: Nuke < Fluid Nuke < Vacuum Nuke < LFTR = THTR = Naq Reactor < Fusion < Compact Fusion for power, per reactor. For breeding, Nuke < LFTR = Naq Reactor < HTGR in terms of breeding speed and outputs, with fusion being required to make some materials.%n%nThe first nuclear source you have access to is the Industrialcraft 2 Nuclear Reactor, usually called a nuke. It's a small singleblock that can have additional chambers attached to it to make a multiblock structure, and the amount of chambers decides the amount of space available for the nuke's components. Inside it, fuel rods with radioactive materials generate power, and every other item serves to control the temperature of the reactor and keep it from exploding. It generates EU directly, but it can be upgraded to a fluid nuke, which outputs hot coolant instead, for the Large Heat Exchanger, but with more efficiency. Lastly, there's also the vacuum nuke, which is very similar to regular nukes but it cools down by using Coolant Cells, which wear out and are only reusable by using Vacuum Freezers. Usual fuels for all of these are Thorium, in EV, and Uranium, in IV.%n%nBetween IV and LuV, there's another kind of reactor, the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR). In this large multi, the Thorium and Uranium are mixed with very hot, molten salts (which need to be prepared in another multi), improving the power generation at the cost of additional processing. It's an expensive setup, but the depleted fuel can be recycled into many more byproducts than usual, especially at LuV, where you can get almost all the noble gases amongst other things, alongside huge amounts of power.%n%nAt those same tiers (albeit mostly for LuV and above), there are also two larger multis, the Thorium High Temperature Reactor (THTR) and the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR). The THTR is mostly for power, needing an input of about 0.5 IV amps and outputting LuV power at a varied amount of amps, whereas the HTGR is a breeder reactor, outputting 1/20 the amount of hot coolant, which is where the power generation comes from, but with much better ratios for breeding into Lutetium and other elements.%n%nAnother kind of nuclear reactor is the Good Generators Naquadah Reactor, which coincidentally has recipes to consume Thorium Liquid Fuel and Uranium Liquid Fuel, alongside the several types of Naquadah fuel that exist. With these two, this reactor can process those elements much faster than regular nukes, which is helpful for power and for breeding, but it requires more processing until those fuels are ready to be consumed. Additionally, there are fuel rods for the IC2 nukes that use different Thorium and Uranium fuels, more or less related to these. %n%nFrom then on, it's fusion power. The infamous GregTech Fusion Reactors work by fusing two elements into a new one, which is often a required step for progression, but they also turn the power they require into exponentially more in the way of plasma. Helium and Tin Plasma are some of the most used for power, and putting them into Plasma Turbines is an excellent source of power for lategame, in ZPM to UEV and so on. There are 4 tiers to the regular Fusion Reactors, but there is also compact fusion and some other kinks to fusion that you might explore later on.%n%nThis page will mostly serve to guide you into making a choice between all of these possibilities. It's pretty much guaranteed that you'll use at least 2-3 of these setups, so try to get comfortable with these quest descriptions.

# Quest: Focus on Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSg.name=Focus on Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSg.desc=This side of the advanced fission branch will focus on the items you can get from nuclear fission. In terms of physics, this fission refers to atoms being broken into two parts, each of which generates a different atom. This has potential to produce some interesting stuff and, perhaps, replace some chemical lines.%n%nAs you advance, your rewards will scale just as the complexity does. However, this part is one where development has lagged behind, and some fission setups are poorly rewarding when it comes to byproducts. However, as those setups are updated, so will these quests, so check back on new updates to see what has changed!

# Quest: Fission Guidelines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSw.name=Fission Guidelines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSw.desc=The branch to the left and to the right are both about nuclear fission, or the midgame content about fusion. If you're looking for fusion, you went the wrong way! Go straight down for that content, although it only begins in LuV.%n%nOn the left side, the top side is the beginning of it all, with your usual IC2 nukes that were developed more than 10 years ago. On the bottom, the neat and powerful upgrades to those nukes, either fluid or vacuum.%n%nOn the right side, the top side is dedicated to power, whereas the bottom side is dedicated to breeding (byproducts). This covers the more GTNH-exclusive fission content, all of which comes after IC2 nukes, and generally builds on their concept to work faster and pump out more complex, and often more useful things.

# Quest: IC2 Nuke Variations
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTA.name=IC2 Nuke Variations
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTA.desc=This branch of the questline focuses on the IC2 nukes that work differently from the simple kind that is explored on the branch right next to this one. They are more powerful, but also require more setup.%n%nThe main two kinds are fluid nukes and vacuum nukes, which will be explained in the following quests. However, there are also other obscure types, such as wrench nukes, which might or might not work in the current version.%n%nThose are memes, but if any new viable type of IC2 nuke is ever introduced, it will be explained in this section.

# Quest: Build the Assembly Line First
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTQ.name=Build the Assembly Line First
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTQ.desc=This branch refers to nuclear fusion. This content is strictly LuV onwards, so you will need the Assembly Line before even starting to think about fusion. It is the most "endgame" content on this quest page, so it's the one left for last.%n%nThe quest you need to complete is in the "Multiblock Goals" tab. There are also fusion-related quests in the LuV, ZPM and UV tabs, amongst others, so check them out when you're there.

# Quest: Improved Fission
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTg.name=Improved Fission
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTg.desc=This branch starts at mid-IV. In this direction, you will find several setups that are related to nuclear fission, the same process that the IC2 nukes do, but in more complex and rewarding ways. Through here, you can get power and breeding byproducts as you would with nukes, but faster and with more variety of options and goals. %n%nThat's right. If you've used IC2 nukes, you might have learned more or less how they work, but the whole system feels a bit dated. That's no surprise, considering that this is base IC2 content and from 10 years ago or more. Whatever additions GTNH gave to those setups, they were minimal in comparison to the general implementation of those nukes. In fact, some of the new content for those was a result of new nuclear fission content that was sort of backported into nukes. %n%nWe have good progression standards here, though. Once you've reached IV, LuV and so on, you will be able to use more advanced ways to work with Thorium and Uranium! These fuels are almost always the focus of the whole thing, with Plutonium coming in from time to time, but each new reactor will demand them to be supplied in a different way for things to work properly. The power generating reactors featured here are the LFTR, the THTR and the Naq-related reactors.%n%nFinally, this questline features many different multis and setups that are often unrelated to each other. Instead of forcing you to build a full LFTR setup before getting access to the THTR, for example, these quests will have simple required tasks, and simple rewards. The optional tasks will have the main expensive crafting, to guide you in building these setups if you're interested in them.

# Quest: Thorium as Early Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTw.name=Thorium as Early Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTw.desc=The very first step into nuclear power is done with Thorium in an Industrialcraft2 nuke. This multiblock already has a good amount of information in the questbook, split between the EV and How to Generate Power pages, so you should look at those if you want even more information that might not be written here. For the sake of not repeating everything, this will be more of a summary.%n%nThorium nukes are better for creating other elements, specifically Lutetium, than for power. The best setup needs the maximum amount of chambers, 6, and a lot of components inside the reactor to burn 10 quad Thorium rods and generate 1920 EU/t, close to one EV amp. If you made 4 of these, you would get close to an IV amp, but this becomes very costly between the total 36 chambers and the recursive crafting of the components inside. The good news is that Thorium is a very cheap fuel, easily mined in the Nether, and recyclable in large amounts from depleted fuel rods.%n%nThis setup, and many others, can be found in the GTNH wiki in the "Nuclear Reactors" page. However, to display it here as best I can, this is the 1920 EU/t Thorium reactor:%n%nOPVOVOPPO%nEOOEOEOOE%nORRORORRO%nORRORORRO%nEOOEOEOOE%nOPPOVOVPO%n%nE -> Component Heat Exchanger (8 needed)%nV -> Component Heat Vent (4 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (26 needed)%nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Thorium (10 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (6 needed)%n%nYou can make this setup, if you wish, but the only required task to continue to the next quest are 10 single Thorium rods. 

# Quest: The Path of Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUA.name=The Path of Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUA.desc=The most advanced nuclear technology there is to use in the pack is nuclear fusion. This is an event where two atoms collide with each other and fuse into a different atom while simultaneously generating energy from the plasma, when it is processed. It's impossible to perform in a reactor in real life, because the temperature requirements are too high to maintain any kind of reactor solid with decent efficiency. In GTNH, though, we have better materials.%n%nThe first Fusion Reactor can be built in late LuV, and each tier unlocks some material that is important to progress into the later tiers. Fusion crafting becomes important at that stage, for materials such as Europium, Americium, Neutronium and Oganesson, so you will want to dedicate reactors to specific things later on. More importantly, these materials come out as plasma, which needs to be cooled down to be turned into ingots and plates. On top of that, though, this cooling process is where you can get lots of power!%n%nThe usual process of power generation here is to pump EU into the Fusion Reactor. It needs enough energy to start the reaction, which will then proceed quickly and output good amounts of plasma. This plasma goes into Plasma Turbines, which output huge amounts of EU/t and the cooled down material, ready to be used in further crafting. A beginner's setup can output 640,000 EU/t from one reactor before overclocking, and this grows quickly over time. Fusion power dominates the game for several tiers due to its simplicity, receding away from the powergen setups that were getting more and more complicated with each tier. Two materials fuse into one, plasma comes out, goes into turbine and boom, lots of energy! It's like a steam tier powergen but with big numbers.%n%nTo summarize, fusion is required for progression because of the materials it produces. At the same time, it's very powerful as a source of EU.

# Quest: Building the Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUQ.name=Building the Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUQ.desc=All the regular Fusion Reactors share the same structure. The tier they belong to is determined by the materials used, which become more expensive for each tier. Tier 1 is LuV, tier 2 is ZPM, tier 3 is UV and there's also a tier 4. The structure looks like a huge ring, which barely fits in one chunk, with the controller on the inside of the ring, not the outside.%n%nTo help you with placing all the blocks in the right places, the controller's interface shows a diagram of which blocks go where. To get a 3D view of the placements in the world, use the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector on the controller. If you need even more assistance, there are lots of resources on the internet that explain how it's build, since this is a big GregTech multiblock that is required in many packs, and almost always built the same way.%n%nThe original quests for each reactor tier will be included in the questline, since they provide good information about each tier and are updated.

# Quest: Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUg.name=Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUg.desc=Eventually, the previous nukes will not be big enough. You can make more of them, to get more power, but it's clear that you need something bigger. Bigger, literally. The next step in nuclear fission starts with a bigger multiblock, built on top of the original nuke. By surrounding it with a 5x5x5 cube of Reactor Pressure Vessels, it will become a different type of multiblock, the fluid nuke.%n%nAfter doing this, there's no direct EU generation anymore. The main output of a working fluid nuke is Hot Coolant, a fluid that can be turned into Steam or Superheated Steam in another multi, the Large Heat Exchanger (LHE). Steam means power, as you already know, so the obvious chain of processes here is a fluid nuke into an LHE, and then into Steam Turbines. These added steps are required to make EU from a nuke of this type (or, at least, they're the most popular way of doing it), but this work is rewarded by the final EU/t output of the setup, which is much larger than a regular nuke's output with the same amount of fuel.%n%nThe difference exists because regular nukes actually have a 50%% penalty to EU/t. It's such a big step-up that, in reality, one fluid nuke is enough for IV power, if it's powerful enough. The one in this quest, though, is not that one, because fluid nukes in general have some additional complications that will be harder to deal with it. In fact, for this, you have the option to use Thorium as fuel and still get a good amount of power! What you will need are the fluid nuke blocks, but there is an optional task for this setup that only needs some blocks from the setup.

# Quest: Thorium as Breeding Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUw.name=Thorium as Breeding Fuel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUw.desc=Alternatively, you might choose to only process Thorium for its main output, Lutetium. This is important because Lutetium is required to make Americium in a Fusion Reactor down the line, and that is a recipe you will need to do in order to progress. Your objective is to breed Thorium into Lutetium, which means you might want to focus on a breeder reactor.%n%nWhat is a breeder reactor? In this case, it's an IC2 nuke designed to consume as much Thorium as possible. The main cost here is the amount of chambers or nuke components you'll have to make. If you want to save on Overclocked Heat Vents, make a tower of 0-chamber nukes, each with the following setup:%n%nRPR%nORP%nRPR%nPRP%nRPR%nORP%n%nR -> Single Fuel Rod of Thorium (9 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (2 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (7 needed)%n%nOtherwise, if you have excess Overclocked Heat Vents and want to save up on chambers, turn to this setup:%n%nORORORO%nROEOEOR%nORORORO%nROROROR%nOPOPOPO%nROROROR%n%nE -> Heat Exchanger (2 needed)%nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Thorium (16 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (21 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (3 needed)%n%n(Each of the latter is worth 7x the former in terms of breeding.)%n%nTo complete this quest, you'll need to get Lutetium from one cycle of the any reactor setup. Which setup you choose is up to you, of course.

# Quest: Large Heat Infrastructure
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVA.name=Large Heat Infrastructure
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVA.desc=A required intermediate machine between your fluid nukes and your power is the Large Heat Exchanger (LHE). It takes in a hot fluid, in this case Hot Coolant, and transforms Distilled Water into Steam or Superheated Steam depending on how fast the hot fluid is coming in. It's important to only use Distilled Water here, because the Steam Turbines will output and recycle it back to the LHE.%n%nFor this purpose, you will need around one LHE per fluid nuke if you're doing one of the good setups from the wiki. None of them will reach the maximum flow one LHE can accept, but any setup above 800 HU will give you Superheated Steam, which is more efficient for EU and what you want to get.%n%nIf your setup does not match that 800 HU threshold, you can use a Hot Coolant buffer and set up a redstone latch so that the Hot Coolant flows in fast enough, until the buffer is almost empty. ProjectRed has a special block that acts as the latch, and you will then need two redstone signals that scale with the amount of fluid stored in your buffer tank. One of the signals should be normal, and the other reversed.%n%n

# Quest: Fuel Input Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVQ.name=Fuel Input Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVQ.desc=Reactor Platings. These are very important for automation, although their supposed use is not this one. They serve to increase the maximum temperature of the reactor, but that is useless to you because you'll be using heat-neutral setups. Instead, they are simply the cheapest way to fill every slot of your nukes, except for those where fuel rods need to go.%n%nAs you know, the placement of each component is critical to keep the reactor safe. Fuel automation is as simple as just pushing fuel rods into the reactor, but you need to make it so the open slots are the only safe places for the rods. From there, you can extract with a filter set to the depleted version of the rods you are using. and the exchange will happen seamlessly.%n%nFrom there, you can turn the depleted rods into usable rods by putting them in the Thermal Centrifuge, adding back the fuel that wasn't recycled (each type of rod recycles different amounts of fuel) and the Empty Fuel Rods/Steel Rods.

# Quest: Focus On Power Generation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVg.name=Focus On Power Generation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVg.desc=Each side of this branch will focus on one of the two halves of nuclear fission outputs. This side will focus on generating power from the reactors available here, which is probably why you're here in the first place.%n%nThese setups share one purpose: when they were created, they were meant to bridge the gap between IC2 nukes and fusion, because there was really nothing else worth using beyond fluid nukes if there were no backups available, or redstone automation was too unreliable for vacuum nukes. Not only is there a full 2-tier gap of one single powergen until fusion, but there's also a required power input in order to begin a fusion reaction in the first place. This is both boring and difficult to push through, especially with the Assembly Line in the middle, so here we are.%n%nThe first setup you can put together is the LFTR chain, although only one half of it is available in IV. As such, that is where we will start.

# Quest: Liquid Fluorine Thorium Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVw.name=Liquid Fluorine Thorium Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVw.desc=What a complicated name this is. What does it mean?%n%nWell, it's what is called a molten salt reactor. The Liquid Fluoride part means that the nuclear fuel is actually a liquid, mixed in with fluoride salts. This is a mechanism that makes it more difficult to get the fuel ready for fission, but also makes the process more efficient, gives out more byproducts and also removes the danger of explosion. That's right, nuclear meltdowns are a thing of the past! The molten salt is designed to flow downwards into a hole where it solidifies, in case the reactor has problems, so it's impossible for the fission process to continue into an explosive mess.%n%nThere are three downsides, though. One of them was mentioned just above, the fuel needs more processing to be ready for the LFTR, and more input materials to reach the right mixture. After it goes through the reactor, it comes out as depleted, and this part too requires more processing steps, although it gives out a lot more useful chemicals than the single Lutetium/Plutonium the IC2 nuke depletion process gave. Lastly, the molten salt is very hot and very corrosive, which means it would destroy the materials used to build the IC2 nukes. You will need newer, stronger and more expensive materials to build a reactor, not to mention its much larger size. %n%nThe structure for this multi is truly something else. It has not one, but four required Dynamo Hatches, which should all be the Buffered type, either EV, IV or LuV depending on the fuel being fed into the reactor, with better fuels being unlocked at later progression stages. This means that one LFTR makes either 1 LuV amp, 1 ZPM amp or 1 UV amp while running. It also requires 2 Maintenance and 4 Muffler Hatches, when it has no maintenance problems or pollution output! Mysterious are the workings of this reactor.%n%nOther than this, all the inputs and outputs are fluids. The minimum amount you'll need is 2 inputs and 4 outputs, although one of the outputs comes out over time, and not on recipe finish. This output is Uranium 233, a very rare isotope that can get you deeper into LFTR fuels and more power, hardly obtainable from any other source.

# Quest: First Half of LFTR Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWA.name=First Half of LFTR Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWA.desc=The LFTR processing chain has two halves, with the first being in mid-late IV and the second requiring the Assembly Line and more materials to finish. Aside from power, both of these halves have special outputs that can be helpful for progression, but the second half is most likely the one that holds the most value. Regardless, the full processing chain around the reactor and its fuel will keep outputting everything, so it's worth it to look at what it gives.%n%nLet's start with the LFTR Fuel 1 outputs, after the fuel is consumed in the reactor. U233 and UF6 are both used to make more fuel. U233 will be used until you have Sparge Towers to improve your fuel production, while UF6 is a part of the good fuel recipe that you always want to use. T Salt is processed in the Reactor Processing Unit to yield Proactinium, which decays into even more U233, and then in the Cold Trap to yield more U233 and UF6.%n%nRemember: U233 is the early source of fuel, UF6 is the one you will switch to as you progress.%n%nMeanwhile, U Salt also processes into more fuel, but with a bonus of automated Phosphorous Dust. Unfortunately, you won't get a lot of it, but it is still a breeding output from the nuclear fission and is needed for GT++ alloys and other purposes.%n%nTB Salt is very similar to T Salt, but with higher amounts of the same output and also Beryllium Fluoride, whose output grows into more than what you used when you reach the later parts of the chain. Free Beryllium!

# Quest: Sparge Tower
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWQ.name=Sparge Tower
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWQ.desc=This is the last structure of the LFTR chain, and the only one gated after the Assembly Line. The best LFTR fuel, Fuel 3, is locked after this, and a lot of useful byproducts are only obtainable here as well, so it's important that you build this if you have a working LFTR.%n%nThe structure itself is very similar to a Distillation Tower, but with different blocks. The controller is the most expensive part, but the biggest obstacle is having the Assembly Line; everything after that shouldn't be too difficult. It's recommended that you have more than one tower, but for one focus on making only one. %n%nNote: the height of this tower is not adjustable. It is meant to be a 3x8x3 multiblock with at least 45 Sparge Tower Casings.

# Quest: Fusion Europium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWg.name=Fusion Europium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWg.desc=There are chemical elements that are very important as building materials for high-tier machines. Unfortunately, some of these elements are very hard to find naturally, if at all, and need to be created by hand. They're not alloys, not a mix of materials, but they can be a mix of atoms...%n%nEuropium is the first wall that can be solved by fusion, and only by fusion. It is possible to find it in ores, but even the most complicated magic rituals to get them need some Europium to start, which leaves fusion crafting as the most reliable option to automate the entire process. It is a slow craft, but not an expensive one provided you already have the reactor built, since it uses cheap materials as inputs: Hydrogen and Neodymium. Both of these were used extensively for progression, so you should not have any trouble grabbing several hundreds of each to start this reaction.%n%nIt is important that you gather a lot of inputs. Each time the Fusion Reactor changes recipe, it has a start-up period where it needs a large amount of energy to begin crafting. In the case of Europium, you'll need 150 million EU to start crafting it, and then 7,077,888 EU per ingot of Europium crafted. This does not come out as plasma, so you can't get energy back from it! Additionally, each ingot takes 14.4 seconds to craft, so you can come out with a few stacks of Europium relatively quickly. During this time, you cannot produce plasma for power, so it's a good idea to have a good amount of EU stored, or other powergen setups working in the background, while you craft this material.%n%nWith Europium, you can craft a new kind of boule, wafers and many other things! Check NEI to see what you have unlocked.

# Quest: How Much Power From One Reactor?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWw.name=How Much Power From One Reactor?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWw.desc=A completed Fusion Reactor does not generate any EU on its own, it only consumes it. That said, it's very simple to generate power from plasma, a one-step process of having a Plasma Turbine. These special turbines only work with plasma and are significantly more expensive than the previous ones, requiring Tungstensteel for the body and Naquadah + Naquadah Alloy for the controller.%n%nFirst, how much plasma can one tier 1 reactor produce? The best option for power at this stage is Helium Plasma, with its cheap inputs, and this takes 6.4 seconds per bucket to generate. Since a bucket is worth 81,920,000 EU, that equates to 640,000 EU/t at 100%% efficiency or 960,000 EU/t at 150%%. That is almost 8 ZPM amps, a massive power spike compared to the powergen available before this, with almost no processing before the plasma! For most players, fusion is the only source of power for 3 or 4 tiers, and all other ways of getting power are much more complicated and harder to upscale.%n%nThat said, you will still need multiple turbines to actually consume all of the plasma. At LuV, each turbine can only output the equivalent of 1 ZPM amp, so you will need high-efficiency turbines that don't go above the value of 131,072 EU/t output. Three candidates, in descending order of efficiency, are: Large Rhodium-Palladium at 150%% and 124,740 EU/t, Normal Draconium at 145%% and 121,800 EU/t and Large Tungstencarbide at 140%% and 123,480 EU/t.%n%n§4§lNote:§r §cthe suggestions in this questline might be outdated, and there might be other options that are just as good, if not better.§r Look through NEI and ask other people, there might be a new setup that can replace the ones in these quests!

# Quest: Optional Tier 1 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXA.name=Optional Tier 1 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXA.desc=Osmium - from Helium and Tungsten. Osmium from the platline is quite power-hungry, which this recipe won't solve, but it will at least help you past the terrible output rate of Osmium. You can get it faster from here as long as you can keep supplying Tungsten and power.%n%nSunnarium - from Helium + Glowstone. If you've had difficulty in getting lots of Sunnarium after the Molecular Transformer nerf, you can try this for your Solar Panels and other things. Glowing Coral processing with UUM is recommended, though.%n%nBoron - from Lithium and Helium. If you haven't automated this yet, for Borosilicate Glass for example, this is one way to do it. You will need lots of glass for the Mega Blast Furnace and other big multis of the kind, so it's not a useless recipe.

# Quest: Powering-up Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXg.name=Powering-up Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXg.desc=The previous setup's EU/t might not have impressed you. You have enough materials to put together the fluid nuke structure, but you want something more than what you've seen before. What kind of setup is powerful enough to output several IV amps, and sustain a developed IV base on its own? That sort of setup is shown in this quest, but it requires more multiblocks, and therefore more expense than the previous quest's chain. The fuel is the same, Uranium, so at this point it's certainly the least of your worries, until you try to automate the fuel input, at least.%n%nThe components inside the nuke get more and more complicated, so at this point I'm going to ask you to look at the wiki, under the Nuclear Reactors page §9§n([url] https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Nuclear_Reactors [/url])§r, and scroll down to the fluid nuke setups, specifically the 1352 HU, 2 Quad Uranium and 1408, 3 Quad Uranium, 1 Dual Uranium ones. The main difference between these two setups is that the first needs Iridium Neutron Reflectors, which are quite expensive if you haven't done the platline yet, while the second doesn't use them but is harder to automate due to having more than one type of rod.%n%nWhat's the final EU/t output, at 170%% turbine efficiency? 36288 and 38016 EU/t, respectively.%n%nAfter automating the nuke itself, there is still more to do, though. The LHE is required, as usual, but these setups cause something new to happen: the LHE starts outputting Superheated Steam, due to the high flow of hot coolant that it receives, which means that you need two sets of turbines instead of one. This type of steam must go into Large HP Steam Turbines, which use a good amount of Tungstensteel for the controller and stacks of Titanium for the casings. After those, it goes into the usual Large Steam Turbines, and the process is complete.%n%nThere is yet another new thing to worry about, in case all of this wasn't enough: the Steam flow is very high, higher than before, which means it's likely you will need 3 or more of each turbine type, further compounding on the costs you'll have here. %n%nYour best option for a turbine in the IV tier is the HSS-E at 170%% turbine efficiency. %n%nThere is another turbine at 180%% efficiency with the HSS-S however; this turbine requires a robust platinium line completed to spare the resources for it.

# Quest: Vacuum Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXw.name=Vacuum Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXw.desc=What's the next step, running nuclear reactors in a perfect vacuum? That would be pretty funny, I'd like to see that.%n%nDisclaimer: this last step is not very stable. It's very risky to do it in servers with no backups, because it relies on redstone circuits to keep the reactor from exploding. Use multiple failsafes to guarantee safety. Never ever build a vacuum nuke in a Thermos server!%n%nVacuum nukes are an interesting GTNH-specific setup. They use only three components: fuel rods, platings to fill the empty slots for automation purposes, and coolant cells. Those cells you have used to make Energy Hatches, for example, they're used here to keep the reactor from overheating and exploding. The main difference this setup has is that these cells are consumable, and will wear out over time. You will need to add fresh cells into the reactor to keep running it safely, but the crux of the show is that you don't need to make new ones - you just need to cool them down again.%n%nThe Vacuum Freezer! That's why it's called a vacuum nuke! Elementary, my dear Steve. This kind of setup relies on using EU to refill the coolant cells, so to speak, and get much more EU from the reactor than you spend to keep it running. However, the redstone automation for this is quite tricky. If you just try it blindly, it might take you a long time to figure it out, and it might have explosive results. Check the Vacuum Reactors page on the wiki (§9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Vacuum_Reactors[/url]§r) if you want a detailed guide that goes far beyond what I could write in this quest description.%n%nThis quest task is for the last setup shown in the wiki, specifically the 8720-43600 EU, 40 Quad Uranium setup. As the title implies, it can produce up to 43600 EU/t, but it will require multiple filters and failsafes to run it safely. The bonus, compared to fluid nukes, is that the LHE + turbine setup is not necessary for these high output numbers.

# Quest: Can We Get Uranium Here?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYA.name=Can We Get Uranium Here?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYA.desc=Yes, you can. In fact, you can get it much earlier than EV, but the speed at which you get it can vary wildly, depending on how you approach this problem. Uranium is the main upgrade to Thorium in nukes, with a lot more power to give and a different useful breeding byproduct, but you need about 3 stacks of Uranium 238 to set up the most powerful basic IC2 Uranium Nuke.%n%nHow do you get it, though? The one answer is, you get it from Thorium. Looking at NEI, the Thorium ore processing has a chance to give Uranium dusts, which you can use as fuel, but this happens very slowly, especially considering that Thorium is a rare ore in the Nether, even if each ore block gives 4 crushed dust. The reality seems to be that fast Uranium only happens when you can mine from t2 planets, but this is not the only way. There is a secret, and this secret involves IC2 crops.%n%nHow does it work? Well, it's simple. The IC2 crop that corresponds to Thorium, the God of Thunder, can quadruple each Crushed Thorium Ore into 4 Purified Thorium Ore, but it also outputs, in fluid form, one Uranium Ingot! This means that each Thorium Ore gives you 4 Uranium Ingots, and with around 42 ore, you can do one cycle of that big reactor setup. God of Thunder needs the ore under it, though, so make sure you save some for that purpose.%n%nEV Uranium nukes are a achievement intended mostly for IC2 crop users, so this quest won't demand something like that. Still, it's a useful secret, so here it is. Additionally, the Uranium crop quest in the questbook awards you with 32 Pitchblende when you complete it, which might prove useful for both for quadrupling Uranium and getting Radium for Radon!

# Quest: Uranium Basic Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYQ.name=Uranium Basic Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYQ.desc=The big brother to the Thorium nuke, the Uranium nuke. The biggest setup you can put together for a single IC2 Nuclear Reactor uses 7 Quad Uranium Rods, or 28 single rods. This amounts to almost 3 stacks of Uranium 238 (U238), a difficult amount to get from Thorium but much easier to get from the green ores found in Phobos. The setup is very similar to the previous one, but with some important differences. What are they?%n%nThe first one is the fuel. These fuel rods use a mixture of U238 and a bit of U235, which is rarer. To get U235, you can gamble on the chance of getting the dust from processing some of the related ores, which might be good enough, but it's also possible to use Thaumcraft to convert 9 nuggets of U238 to 7 nuggets of U235, without needing a lot of Thaumcraft progress. Assembling this fuel and putting it into rods gets it ready to be used for power, with more EU/t but less burn time compared to Thorium, 50000 seconds for Thorium compared to 20000 seconds for Uranium.%n%nThe second difference in the nuke setup. Uranium eats up more per rod, so a different arrangement inside the nuke is required. For the highest EU/t in this situation, 4200 EU/t, the setup is:%n%nRVOEOOVOP%nPVOOVOORO%nPOROOROOV%nVOOVOOVOP%nOROOROORO%nPOVPOVPOV%n%nE -> Component Heat Exchanger (1 needed)%nV -> Component Heat Vent (11 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (28 needed)%nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Uranium (7 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (7 needed)%n%nWhen the fuel rods get repleted, you can reprocess them to get 3/4 of the U235 back, and also a bit of Plutonium.

# Quest: Further IC2 Nuke Potential
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYg.name=Further IC2 Nuke Potential
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYg.desc=An observant nuclear scientist might have seen many more options for IC2 nukes than those mentioned in the quests up to this point. Thorium, Uranium, Thorium, Uranium... what about all of these other things, what do they do?%n%nUnfortunately, this is where the copying of builds ends. The nuke research that has been done is almost all about the fuel rods that existed from base IC2, namely the Thorium, Uranium and MOX ones. Almost all the others were added with GTNH, and they are more or less ignored by most players. However, not all of them are useless! To see why, keep reading.%n%nGoodGenerators has added two new pairs of Uranium and Plutonium rods: High Density, and Excited. Both of these use a lot more of the element per rod, to the extent where you'll need stacks and stacks of each to run a single nuke, which means that these are fuels for later in progression, when you have stockpiled a lot of U238. The main difference is that High Density rods output a lot more EU/t with the same heat output, whereas the Excited rods do output a lot more heat than usual. This means that the former are good for vacuum nukes, while the latter are good for fluid nukes. This is true because vac nukes want more EU/t from rods with less heat, to make the coolant cells last longer, while fluid nukes produce Hot Coolant directly from the amount of heat dissipated into the reactor. The Plutonium versions also have MOX-like behavior, while the Uranium ones don't.%n%nThis is not the end of high-powered nukes, though. There is a special, one-of-a-kind fuel rod called The Core, and there is a single vac nuke setup in the wiki using these things that outputs 7.906.206 EU/t, or about 3 amps of UHV. A truly ridiculous number, matching the truly ridiculous cost of making the fuel itself. This is a setup for a time in which you shouldn't be using IC2 nukes anymore, a true challenge for the mad nuclear scientist.%n%nWhat else is there? Unfortunately, not much. Every other fuel rod is largely useless. Tiberium rods can breed Zirconium and Xenon, if you need them, Lithium breeds Tritium and the Naquadah rods are unbelievably bad at generating power, which many other better reactors to use the Naquadah in. In terms of power, nothing else is worth using.

# Quest: High Density Vacuum Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYw.name=High Density Vacuum Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYw.desc=Throw more U238 at it!%n%nIf you ever though that a vacuum nuke doesn't burn through Uranium fast enough, this one is for you. High Density Uranium, or HDU, outputs twice the EU of the regular Uranium rods, and lasts for 70000 seconds instead of 20000. The heat output, like mentioned before, is the same, so the actual effect of using these rods in a vacuum nuke setup is that your final EU/t per nuke is multiplied by 2, and rods will need to be replaced less often, but the U238 consumption per cycle is a lot higher.%n%nThis also helps if you aren't automating the fuel rod input, since each one lasts longer. It's better if it's automated, but there's no danger of explosions if this part is done manually, so it's technically safe, as long as your EU buffer doesn't start complaining from lack of input.%n%nAs the last step before using The Core, you have High Density Plutonium. This HDP has MOX-like behavior, so it can output even more EU/t than HDU, up to several LuV amps per nuke, but you need to keep it running at high temperatures, which means even more risk! There is no such thing as too much safety, if you try to put one of these together.

# Quest: Plutonium 239
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZA.name=Plutonium 239
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZA.desc=Red as an ingot, white as a blob. These are the same element, and the same isotope, even if they don't seem like it.%n%nPlutonium is a major part of nuclear fission reaction, mainly as an product of Uranium fissile fuel, when an atom in the mix captures a neutron and then emits an electron and an anti-neutrino. After several hours in the reactor, the fuel is considered depleted and there's enough Plutonium in it to separate the two through thermal centrifuging, a basic and inefficient way to do nuclear reprocessing. Later on, it's possible to improve your methods of handling spent nuclear fuel, but this is the first way you get this nuclear byproduct.%n%nIf you've made Quantum Eyes, you might know one of the main uses of Plutonium: to get Radium. By having enough of it to serve as a catalyst in the reaction, you can convert Uranium to Radium in small quantities without losing any Plutonium. Since you need 6 ingots, you will have to do 3 cycles of the setup shown in the quest before this one, or more if you're running smaller Uranium nukes. However, there is another useful thing you can use this for at this time: more nuclear fuel.%n%nNot just more nuclear fuel, but a different, more complex but also more powerful nuclear fuel. It's known as MOX fuel, and it is essentially a mix of Uranium and Plutonium. The catch is that all the Plutonium spent on creating the fuel is returned to you when reprocessing the depleted rods, alongside the extra you usually get, but not the Uranium return. To source a nuke of this kind, you will need more than 6 ingots.

# Quest: Excited Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZQ.name=Excited Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZQ.desc=This quest is after the vacuum nuke one because the fuel required to do a setup like this is harder to get. Whereas the previous rods were made with compressed Uranium, this fuel needs that same material to then be further processed in GoodGenerators machines, namely the Neutron Activator, to make Excited Uranium Liquid Fuel. It is directly usable in the Naquadah Reactor, with more fuel efficiency there, but you might not be able to build it yet, since it's post-fusion. Instead, you can use said fuel here.%n%nBefore attempting this, you need to know all the mechanics related to the fluid nuke. In fact, this quest won't even have any required tasks, given how challenging it is to create a good setup of this kind. At the time of writing this quest, there is no nuke simulator that supports the Excited Fuel Rods, which means you'll have to first test in Creative mode and gather whatever results you get from there.%n%nThe basis for this setup is simple: Excited Uranium Fuel Rods, the only kind you should consider for this, output 16x more heat than the regular ones, which is a lot more Hot Coolant output if you can send all this heat to the reactor to be turned into power. Only the heat matters, which means that extra EU/t based on temperature will do nothing here. Throw as many rods as you can at this nuke without overheating, that is the challenge.%n%nWhat then? You will surely need many multis if you want to process LuV amps of power, unless you choose some more advanced options. The LHE upgrades into the EHE, the Extreme Heat Exchanger, and this new multi can output either Superheated or Supercritical Steam. For the former, use XL Steam Turbines to process the ludicrous amount of Steam you will be getting. For the latter, you need special turbines.

# Quest: Nukes - Summarized
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZg.name=Nukes - Summarized
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZg.desc=IC2 nukes will fall off when you arrive at fusion energy, for the most part. Although the highest EU/t numbers obtained from these newer, more powerful cells haven't been calculated yet, it is more likely that you will be using them to process the excited materials instead of focusing your powergen on them. %n%nThat said, it is possible to push them very far by using a bigger Heat Exchanger (there are two kinds) and XL Turbines, if going fluid, or by putting together a lot of vacuum nukes. If you want to choose the latter ones, due to their direct EU/t, then there's one last step: The Core.%n%nThese are super-powerful fuel rods that can create UHV setups, as long as you cool them down with the most powerful coolant cells there are. A setup for this exists in the wiki, but the most difficult part will be the redstone automation. These babies will turn your base into a mini Sun, if you let them, so you best have practiced your redstone skills!

# Quest: MOX Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZw.name=MOX Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZw.desc=Upon gathering more Plutonium, you can try building a MOX nuke, the most powerful of the basic nukes. It is a 6-chamber, like usual, and it takes U238 as before, but it outputs close to 6820 EU/t while only using 5 quad rods instead of 7. How is this possible? The answer is... MOX.%n%nMOX means mixed-oxide, which is the name given to the mix of Uranium and Plutonium. In here, rods with this fuel are special in the sense that they don't output a specific amount of EU/t from the usual nuke mechanics. On top of those, it also reacts to the heat of the reactor, generating more energy the hotter it is. To compensate, these rods last only half the time that the Uranium fuel rods do, but their total EU is higher if they are active in very hot reactors. This imposes an obvious problem - hot reactors are not good for your base.%n%nThere is one standardized way of dealing with this: heat-neutral reactors. What this means is that the reactor's temperature does not change while it's active, because the components inside are not interacting with the reactor's temperature value, only with the value of other components like the fuel rods themselves. This limits the type of components you can use, and you'll find that Advanced Heat Vents are now required (the overclocked ones interact with the reactor itself). However, at the same time, you can use any fuel rod to heat the reactor up to a high temperature and then activate a setup of this kind, which ensures safety and efficiency in MOX nukes.%n%nVAAV%nARRA%nVAAV%nVAAV%nARRA%nVAAV%n%nA - Advanced Heat Exchanger (12 needed)%nV - Component Heat Vent (8 needed)%nR - Dual Fuel Rod of MOX (4 needed)%n%n1200-2730 EU/t%n%n(This setup is the most efficient per MOX fuel rod, if you're short on fuel, which you shouldn't be if you're doing a MOX setup)%n%nAEAVPVAEA%nVARAVARAV%nAVAVAVAVA%nEAVARAVAE%nARAVAVARA%nVAEAVAEAV%n%nA - Advanced Heat Vent (26 needed)%nE - Component Heat Exchanger (6 needed)%nV - Component Heat Vent (16 needed)%nR - Quad Fuel Rod of MOX (5 needed)%nP - Reactor Plating (1 needed)%n%n3000-6825 EU/t%n%n(This setup is the most efficient per Advanced Heat Vent)%n

# Quest: Nuclear Fuel Processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaA.name=Nuclear Fuel Processing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaA.desc=The previous reactor is useless on its own, unfortunately. Even if you have built it fully, there's no way to get fuel that it will accept without making another multi that mixes and processes several chemical mixtures into one, the molten salt that generates all that nuclear energy in the LFTR.%n%nThe multi's name is Reactor Fuel Processing Plant (RFPP), although it's easier to call it the Fuel Refinery. It's a mid-late IV multiblock, like the LFTR, especially due to needing 2 ZPM circuits for the Computer Cube used in the controller's recipe. The other casings are similar to what you've made before, and the tooltip gives a good description of what exactly is needed to build the Fuel Refinery. %n%nWhere to put each casing? The bottom two layers are 3x3, and they take the Structural Blocks. On top of the second layer, in the middle block, make a tower of 5 Fluid Containment Blocks, and then cover these with Sealant Blocks, like you would do in a Multiblock Miner. However, the second layer of the 5, from the bottom, uses Reactor Shielding Blocks, 4 of them there instead of the Sealant Blocks. Use the Hologram Projector for assistance if you're having trouble.%n%nWhen it's fully built, you can focus on the recipes. Out of the 5 that are available, you can only do one at this time, the Fuel 1 recipe. To make this fuel, you need molten U235, but also Lithium Fluoride, Beryllium Fluoride and Zirconium Tetrafluoride. Each of the these elements can be obtained with relative ease, each in their own way, but Fluorine is the main part of all this, the main component of the molten salt, so it's a good idea to have a decent source of it. However, the LFTR fuels are also very, very energy dense, so each bucket of Fluorine can bring you a long way.%n%nIf you're looking through NEI, your first response might be "There are no recipes for these fluorides other than reprocessing the depleted fuels! How am I supposed to make these?". The answer is in the dusts: you have to craft the dusts and then fluid extract them into the fluids. There is a spreadsheet which has all the steps in crafting and reprocessing (§9§n[url]https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1JGSt5-ELdra6emngUc7XvKSJc-_-RO0yreRIbOrx0/edit?usp=sharing[/url]§r), to help with how complicated this chain is. %n%nJust make sure you remember, each bucket of fuel is worth many millions, perhaps even billions of EU! Don't let the 207M EU cost per bucket of Fuel 1 discourage you, it turns into much more energy in the LFTR. Besides, this first fuel is just a stepping stone, so don't worry about fully automating everything just yet, the final setup is different from this one.

# Quest: Inputs and Outputs in the LFTR
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaQ.name=Inputs and Outputs in the LFTR
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaQ.desc=Assuming you have both the LFTR and the Fuel Refinery built, and the inputs for the fuel available to be used, you can power up the reactor and leave it running. The first fuel you can use will work with 4 IV Energy Dynamos to output 4 IV amps, as long as the reactor runs, and each cycle lasts for 100 seconds (you can see the recipes on NEI, there's a tab dedicated to the 3 fuels the LFTR can run and what you get from them).%n%nWhat about everything else? The entire setup has 2 inputs and 4 outputs. One of the inputs is any of the 3 possible fuels, the other input is Lithium Tetrafluoroberyllate (LTFB). On the output side, there's one constant: U233 is output in small quantities at random, averaging 10 seconds per output. There are two other outputs, U Salt and UF6, that come from every fuel, although better fuels output more of these per cycle. Finally, T Salt or TB Salt can be outputted, the first from the first fuel and the second from the other two, with TB being more valuable than T. All of these are meant to be processed in order to reach better LFTR fuels, and also useful breeding byproducts.%n%nStarting with the first fuel, every bucket of it will need 2 buckets of LTFB, last 1000 seconds and output a total of 655.536.000 EU at 32.768 EU/t. After this, you will have 367L of U233 on average, 250L of U Salt, 500L of T Salt and 5L of UF6. As you can tell, this is a slow burner, and one bucket of each of these fluids is worth a lot!

# Quest: First Steps in Reprocessing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMag.name=First Steps in Reprocessing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMag.desc=You now have 4 different fluid outputs running away from your LFTR. Each of them needs specific attention, and all of them are useful. %n%nWhere to start looking? The best way to start is at the end, which is to say, the Fuel Refinery. You want to upgrade to the better fuels as soon as possible, and each one has 2 recipes: one with 4 inputs, similar to the recipe you've already done, and one with 2 inputs, focusing on LFTR Fuel Base. The 2-input recipes produce 10x the fuel, so they're much better, but you can't use this recipe alone. The Fuel Base can only be made from reprocessing depleted fuel, and you don't get enough of it to make the same amount of fuel spent. If you perfectly reprocess any of the first two fuels to get Fuel Base, you will come out short and run out of fuel.%n%nGiven that, your strategy will be to use two Fuel Refineries, one for each Fuel 2 recipe, and then change them to Fuel 3 once you've built the Assembly Line, which is required to build the final multiblocks in this line. For Fuel 2, get as much Fuel Base as you can from this chain - EBF <- DT <- RPU <- LFTR and put it into one of the refineries, while using the second one to top off on the remaining fuel you need to keep the LFTR going. You can limit the UF4 on the second refinery to not make too much fuel there, or just turn it on and off, and use as much of the better recipe as possible. You will be able to use the better recipe 100%% of the time, but only after building a Sparge Tower.%n%nAdditional details on the other outputs you can get from reprocessing can be found on the breeding side of this questline branch.

# Quest: Second Half of LFTR Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaw.name=Second Half of LFTR Breeding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaw.desc=There are two gas inputs that the Sparge Tower accepts: Helium and Fluorine. Each one works on different depleted salts (U Salt, T Salt, TB Salt) in a specific way. Helium works with U Salt to make the most valuable byproducts, while Fluorine works with the other two salts to make other byproducts and TF4, which is required to make the LFTR Fuel 3. Here, we'll focus on Helium and U Salt, and the other recipes will be covered on the powergen side of the branch.%n%nAll the U Salt you get from the LFTR, from any fuel, can be ran through the Sparge Tower. It's an additional step that is slow, yet rewarding. The recipe is HV-tier, but it's recommended that you overclock it, and maybe even build multiple towers to accelerate it. All the U Salt you have should pass through these, because sparging it outputs almost every noble gas! Xenon, Neon, Argon, Krypton and Radon will be outputted over time, precious gases to speed up EBF recipes and save up lots of energy, and also for the Void Miner. Radon, on the other hand, is required to make Quantum Eyes, Quantum Stars and many other important items.%n%nEven though you get many gases, the speed at which you'll get them isn't great, since it depends on the speed at which LFTR fuel is being consumed. This should not be your only source of these gases, but it is a completely EU-free way to get them, considering the amount of energy the LFTR produces.

# Quest: Faster Lutetium Excitement
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbA.name=Faster Lutetium Excitement
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbA.desc=This quest is late LuV.%n%nYou might have read before that Lutetium is necessary as an input for fusion crafting. In a tier 2 fusion reactor, Lutetium + Chrome = Americium, a required material for many required crafts. Lutetium is a material that is obtained exclusively from breeding, so you're in the right place to find ways to get it.%n%nThe very first method, EV's IC2 Thorium nukes, is the cheapest, but also the slowest. Each fuel rod takes 50000 seconds to deplete, almost 14 hours, with half of a Lutetium Dust per depleted rod. Highly stackable designs, such as the 2-chamber 11 quad rod one, will grant you 22 dust per cycle. After building 10 of those, the rate is still 16 dust per hour. This processing speed isn't good enough to keep progressing forever, and there is no need to make more towers of breeder nukes.%n%nYour 3 main options are:%n%n1) HTGR - fastest but also quite expensive multiblock reactor, unfortunately it requires purified thorium232 you will need to purify it first%n2) Lutetium bees - if you started bees getting it should be quite easy%n3) Spamming IC2 nuclear reactors

# Quest: Exciting Liquid Nuking
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbw.name=Exciting Liquid Nuking
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbw.desc=With the reactor built, it's time to automate the fuel and additives, since there are additives this time. They are optional, so let's begin with the required inputs.%n%nLiquid Air is trivial to automate: it's a Vacuum Freezer job. Input energy and Air and output Liquid Air, there are quests for this. The fuels themselves are more complicated, but the three of them follow a similar set of recipes. First, you grab a lot of the radioactive element (Thorium, Uranium or Plutonium), wrap it in a specific foil and then put in an Implosion Compressor to make very dense nuggets. These are into the High Density items you need, which are then mixed with specific dusts to create the basic fuel fluid.%n%nThis part is where it becomes complicated, though. To get the energy out of this radioactive fluid, you need to activate it. Thorium is done by mixing with Helium Plasma (t1 fusion), while the other two are made directly in the Fusion Reactor (t2 fusion). The activated fuels can be thrown directly in the reactor to produce EU, at a very slow pace. Your bottleneck should be the main radioactive element, so make sure you can source it fast enough.%n%nBeing here, you should have a Large Naquadah Reactor ready to go. However, it is true that these Excited Fuels can be used to make fuel rods for IC2 nukes, with much larger heat outputs meant for fluid nukes. You can try to use them there, but there are no simulated setups of any kind for those rods, so it's going to be a very experimental setup if you ever decide to make it.

# Quest: The Fission Finale
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcA.name=The Fission Finale
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcA.desc=Here we are, at the end of fission.%n%nAt this time, you have more than entered the fusion tiers. In fact, the last fusion setups go as deep as t2 fusion, so you might be running both fission and fusion at the same time, although the latter is generally easier and more efficient once the structure is built.%n%nOne of the ultimate goals of fission is a filled HTGR, or its younger brother, the THTR, two very expensive multis that can grant you essentially infinite power or breeding products. However, the Naquadah Generator that has those excited nuclear fuels can do much more! The Naquadah fuel line is the reason why it was created, and it can replace t3 fusion and beyond by condensing powergen even more than fusion did, and replace the turbine spam.%n%nThose fuels aren't exactly nuclear fission, nor fusion, and more of a chemical line, so they were not included here. If interested, look at NEI to see what they have to offer.

# Quest: Pebble Reactor Fuels and Outputs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcQ.name=Pebble Reactor Fuels and Outputs
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcQ.desc=Thorium, Uranium and Plutonium. There you go, quest done, onwards. I do find it kind of funny how it always goes back to these. Why is it that when there are problems, it's always you three?%n%nMaking the pebbles for any of these elements is a multi-step process. To get them, you need to throw in huge amount of the main radioactive fuel alongside some materials used to make the outer shell, namely Carbon, Silicon, and Graphite Dust.%n%nFor a full reactor, you will need thousands of stacks of each of these, much more than quest tasks could ask for. Anyways, the depleted pebbles can be centrifuge to recover most of the materials used to reach the final pebbles (Silicon, Graphite, Carbon), alongside a smaller chance at getting the main nuclear material for each kind of pebble. On top of that, you will get the breeding outputs: Lutetium from Thorium, Krypton from Uranium, Xenon from Plutonium.

# Quest: Tin Plasma From T2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcg.name=Tin Plasma From T2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcg.desc=Once you upgrade your Fusion Reactor to tier 2, you gain access to a better recipe for power generation, which is Tin Plasma. Helium-3 is used, as it was before, but now with Silver, which you can automate in a million ways. The processing speed is slightly higher than before, but the fuel value of this plasma is much higher than what you were using before, at 304,496,000 EU per bucket. This impressive fuel value means that the max power output of a single t2 reactor at 100%% fuel efficiency is 2,740,464 EU/t, and with the turbines you can use here, you can twice as much as that or even more!%n%nTo utilize all of the plasma, you will be using 10 or more turbines with good rotors. Before doing that, though, it's a good idea to step back and test your turbines with this plasma, preferably in Creative mode, because the fuel value is so high that one liter of plasma is worth 304,496 EU at 100%% efficiency. If you set the input rate to anything higher than 1 L/t, you will go above the ZPM Dynamo limit, and even 1 L/t will be too high if the turbine's efficiency is 175%% or above! Until you upgrade your hatches, you might once again be stuck will less power output or efficiency than you'd like. There's only one way to fix that.

# Quest: The Overclocking of the Ages
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdA.name=The Overclocking of the Ages
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdA.desc=Tin Plasma is more power-dense, but it's not a required upgrade. As you scale up, it's always worth it to look back at Helium Plasma for how renewable it is, something that Tin Plasma has unfortunately lost a bit of. It can be made renewable, but one of its strengths was in the Molecular Transformer recipe that transformed Tin, the output, into Silver, one of the inputs. This recipe is now in the new Molecular Transformer Multiblock and does not scale as well as before. Therefore it might be easier to use void miners for silver or to stick with Helium Plasma.%n%nAs per usual, running a lower tier recipe awards you with an overclock. Unlike other GT machines, though, the Fusion Reactor's overclock doubles both speed and energy consumption, which maintains the energy consumption per recipe but gives only half of a speed boost that a perfect overclock (like the Large Chemical Reactor) would. This means that a t2 reactor can produce exactly twice as much power as a t1 in the form of plasma output, but the upgrade is bigger than that when taking better turbines into account.%n%nWhat comes next, then? Tier 3 is what is next. There is no new fuel to be used here, your options are either 4x speed on Helium or 2x speed on Tin. After getting the cheaper Americium recipe that's available on t3, you will be able to make more reactors at a cheaper cost, but this lack of fuel upgrade will still be problematic in your progression. You will have to find other ways to upgrade your power, which will be revealed after this.

# Quest: Fusing Americium and Tritanium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdQ.name=Fusing Americium and Tritanium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdQ.desc=A t2 Fusion Reactor unlocks more fusion materials, some of which will again be necessary to progress into the next tiers. One of them is Americium, which is the reason for all the Lutetium worry until now: both are required, because one makes the other. The recipe also needs Chrome as input, but that should be much easier to get than Lutetium or the power needed per bucket of Molten Americium, which is almost 300M EU. %n%nYou will need many stacks of this material for your future progression, but your first goal should be to make 141 ingots (check the ZPM "Making Americium" quest for details). However, if you have extra Lutetium, you should make more Americium, you will not regret doing this when you need more of it later.%n%nAnother useful material you unlock at t2 is Tritanium, which is different from Trinium. The source of this material is fusion, and the inputs to make it are Duranium and Titanium. If you haven't made Duranium before, you'll see that it needs a lot of Radon, almost 8x the amount of Tritanium you end up with. For this, you should already have the Radon loop automated, that step is very important for this.%n%nYou will need Tritanium to progress, just as you need Americium, so it's a good idea to batch craft both of these in your new t2 Fusion Reactor so you don't have to go back to these recipes soon.

# Quest: Bismuth Plasma For Soldering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdg.name=Bismuth Plasma For Soldering
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdg.desc=Who in their right mind would use a plasma to solder things together? That's mental. Well, all the progression at this point is mental, that's all there is to it.%n%nIt's not directly with the plasma, though. It is once again about the Mutated Living Solder, and now its fluid inputs: Tin Plasma and Bismuth Plasma. These are the two main components of the previous solders, and that's the reason they're needed now. Tin Plasma is t2 fusion, and you might have already made a lot of it to generate power, but Bismuth Plasma is t3, with the inputs being Zinc Plasma and Molten Tantalum, which is actually Tritium, Copper and Tantalum in the end. %n%nThe recipes are cheap in power, you just have to make sure the inputs are there. Tritium can be centrifuged from Deuterium, which itself can be centrifuged from Hydrogen Gas, and the other two inputs are easy. You will need 18000L of each plasma for 40000L of the solder, or almost half the amount for each.

# Quest: Optional Tier 2 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdw.name=Optional Tier 2 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMdw.desc=Uranium - from Gold + Aluminium or Magnesium + Mercury. You should have already left nuclear fission behind, but if you ever need Uranium, you can use this? You should have a lot of it already.%n%nPlutonium - from Helium + Uranium. A quick 1:1 conversion from U238 to P239, but you already have access to Plutonium Ore, so this is probably pointless.%n%nCalifornium - from Beryllium + Plutonium. Mostly used for Oganesson, not very useful for anything else, and you won't need a lot of this if replicating Oganesson is an option.%n%n(These 3 recipes makes a possible chain to Oganesson, which can be made in t3 fusion. Not that they are necessarily the best option to get it.)%n%nExcited Uranium Fuel - from Hydrogen and Uranium Liquid Fuel. This is for the Naquadah Generator, which is late ZPM, or possibly to use in IC2 nukes, although that's the worse option. Basically, it's accelerated nuclear fission, if you have interest in that.%n%nExcited Plutonium Fuel - from Hydrogen and Plutonium Liquid Fuel. Same as above, but from Plutonium. This means it's more expensive, but also more powerful, and can yield a lot of power in the Naquadah Generator with the right additives.

# Quest: Optional Tier 3 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMeQ.name=Optional Tier 3 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMeQ.desc=Indium - from Lithium + Silver. This is one of the most important optional fusion recipes, given how difficult Indium is to get. Your options are to either replicate it, make it with fusion, obtain it from the naquadria line, or obtain it from processing sphalerite ore.%n%n(You can make Indium in other ways, of course, but this is a relatively popular, non-forced fusion recipe)%n%nOganesson - from Calcium + Californium. This is the best noble gas of them all, and a very power-hungry recipe compared to most. However, Oganesson will save you power on EBF recipes, reducing recipe time more than any other fluid, and it also boosts Void Miners to their maximum speed. Replicating it might be better, if you have the right setup with GT++ multis.%n%nAmericium - from Hydrogen + Plutonium 241. This is the cheaper Americium recipe that was promised to you in t2, and it no longer needs Lutetium. You should be able to get both of the inputs very easily, so enjoy your cheaper Americium!%n%nNeutronium - from Naquadria + Americium. Neutronium fusion? You probably won't need to use this, but it is a source other than ores that you can try.

# Quest: Smaller Fusion Is Bigger
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMeg.name=Smaller Fusion Is Bigger
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMeg.desc=It's not smaller, it's compact!%n%nCompact Fusion. If you've been looking for a big multiblock to put together, you have arrived at a very neat thing. There's hardly anything that could beat its size, except for a max height Mega Distillation Tower, but this is instead a wide multi instead of a tall one. It is so wide, in fact, that it cannot fit in one chunk, and instead covers a 3x3 chunk space! Make sure you follow the instructions and the hologram properly, and jump in joy when you have one of these built.%n%nYou can choose one of four tiers for this reactor, in the same way as the normal Fusion Reactors. The Compact controller will need 48 of the regular controllers in the same tier, plus some other materials, and more than 2 thousand blocks in the structure, which are conveniently detailed in the tooltip. It is much bigger than the previous reactors, but it also has a huge number of parallels, starting at 64x with t1 and ending at a maximum of 256x with t4! %n%nThis is the go-to when you have found yourself deep into t3 fusion, perhaps even t4, and you find yourself running short on power. Instead of making a tower of reactors, why not make one of these? The only power issue that you'll have after getting it done is the amount of turbines you will need to eat up all the plasma. You probably know about the XL Plasma Turbine, but you should also know that they force huge penalties on most plasmas, including Helium and Tin, if you use good turbine materials like Infinity. Do you remember those fusion chains mentioned in previous quests? This is the time for them. Check the GT++ tab for more details.

# Quest: Thorium Tetrafluoride and Fuel 3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMew.name=Thorium Tetrafluoride and Fuel 3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMew.desc=Whether you've mathed it out from NEI, looked at the spreadsheet or done something else, you might have figured something out: Fuel 3 is better in every way. More power, more byproducts, more everything. However, both recipes for it use Thorium Tetrafluoride (TF4), and the source of this is salt sparging, done in the Sparge Tower. Not only that, but Fuel 3 can only be consumed by having 4 LuV Buffered Dynamo Hatches in the LFTR, which means that it's a fair bit away from the previous steps in this chain.%n%nOnce you've made it there, though, you can start working on getting this fuel. To make it, you will need at least one Sparge Tower dedicated to using Fluorine, with T Salt or TB Salt (TB Salt is better, get it from Fuel 2). There is a recipe that uses Helium, but it's not required for Fuel 3 and is meant for byproducts, so the quest for it is in the breeding half of this branch. Using a single tower for both recipes is a bad idea, so don't do it!%n%nPreferably, you should input Fluorine and TB Salt and let it run for a while. Speeding up the recipe by overclocking and making more towers is a good idea, since the TF4 is your bottleneck now. Alongside it, you get several fluorides: Lithium, Neptunium, Technetium and Selenium. These might prove useful in the future, but your goal is the Thorium one.

# Quest: Naquadah Reactor For Nuclear Fuels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfA.name=Naquadah Reactor For Nuclear Fuels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfA.desc=What is the most powerful nuclear fission generator there is? The answer to that question isn't even a nuclear fission generator, for the most part. The answer is the Large Naquadah Generator. It follows the same principle as the LFTR, use a new processing chain to turn Thorium, Uranium and Plutonium into liquid fuels, very dense with energy, which are then slowly burned to generate large amounts of power over a very long period of time. This reactor, for example, burns its fuels 1 milibucket at a time, over several seconds, when running without additives, a very slow burner by default.%n%nLet's look at the NEI recipes. Excited Thorium outputs 2,200 EU/t, Excited Uranium outputs 12,960 EU/t and Excited Plutonium outputs 32,400 EU/t. These are small numbers, clearly, so this can't possibly be the most powerful nuclear fission reactor. However, this multi is more complicated than that! In total, there are 4 inputs you can provide for it: one of them is the required fuel and another is the also required Liquid Air to generate EU from that fuel, but the other 2 are additives that are optional, yet increase both the efficiency and the consumption speed of the fuel. The controller's tooltip lists all the possible additives and their bonuses.%n%nFuel efficiency here means that the fuel is burned at the same rate, but energy output is increased by the percentage. Let's consider the two best options, Cryotheum and Atomic Separation Catalyst. They multiply with each other, so the energy output is 2.75 x 16 = 44 times the displayed EU/t on NEI! Excited Plutonium, the most energetic of the three fuels, will award you with 1,425,600 EU/t, almost 3 UV amps.

# Quest: Maxed-out LFTR
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfQ.name=Maxed-out LFTR
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfQ.desc=An LuV LFTR running on Fuel 3 outputs 4 ZPM amps per tick, or 524,288 EU/t. Each bucket is worth 1,048,576,000,000 EU, more than a trillion EU! Certainly, this is the most power-dense fuel you've ever held, and now that you've made it here, you can make it to fusion and beyond much more easily. But wait, there's more!%n%nYou might have noticed that the limiting factor in using the best recipe for Fuel 1 and Fuel 2 was the U Salt, which ultimately makes the LFTR Fuel Base. You just can't get enough of it to drop that inefficient 4-input recipe. However, the increased output of U Salt from Fuel 3, alongside the doubling that you can get from processing Helium Sparged U Salt instead of the regular one, means that you can use the 2-input recipe to make all your fuel from now on! If you haven't set up Helium Sparge Towers yet, do so now.%n%nWhen you do this, you can grab the two Fuel Refineries you should have and set them both to the 2-input recipe. Each bucket of Fuel 3 takes 9000 seconds to make, but is consumed in 4000 seconds, so it's good to have more than one Refinery per LFTR. With this, you will make fuel much faster, and generate much more EU than before. If you continue expanding, it's very possible to match the first tiers of fusion power from something like this.

# Quest: Radioactivity's Additives
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfg.name=Radioactivity's Additives
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfg.desc=The Naquadah Reactor has the potential to be an endgame power generator, but only if the right additives are used. These additives boost the EU/t output of the multi, but in different ways, and it's important to upgrade them as quickly as possible. However, going beyond the max output of the Dynamo Hatch is not a good idea!%n%nThere are two types of additives: the coolants and the fuel boosters. The coolants boost fuel efficiency, which means fuel consumption is the same, whereas the boosters increase the speed the multi burns the fuel, increasing the output at the same time.%n%nThere are three coolants, but the 275%% efficiency boost by using Cryotheum should not be ignored. To automate it, you will need an automated source of Blaze Rods and Snowballs (Snow is made from Water). To this, you add Redstone and Saltpeter, and you're done.%n%nThe boosters are more difficult to choose from. Caesium should be ignored, Uranium 235 can be automated from Uranium 238 with magic at an almost 1:1 ratio, but Naquadah is what you probably have ready to use for this, which quadruples the speed of this reactor. However, if this is too slow, you can instead automate Atomic Separation Catalyst to get a 16x speed boost! There are many recipes for this, so choose your favorite.

# Quest: Automation for Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfw.name=Automation for Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMfw.desc=If you've looked at the wiki setups, you might have seen some that seem harder to automate than others. Particularly, that one with two kinds of Uranium Rods. More than filling empty slots with Reactor Platings to force all the inputs to move to the specific slots where the rods must go, this one needs each rod to go in a specific slot!%n%nThe solution for this is a GT cover. The Robot Arm does the same action of moving items around as the Conveyor, but it moves to specific slots. With this, you can move the Dual Rod to where it needs to be, and the Quad Rods can fill the remaining slots as intended. If you're using other setups, you can use a similar logic to do your automation.

# Quest: EV vs. IV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgA.name=EV vs. IV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgA.desc=Your sourcing of Uranium is gonna be very small in EV, unless you use crops. Similarly, your ability to put together the multiblocks needed for the fluid nuke will be better in IV, since you can mine Small Titanium Ore directly, and use GT++ multis. %n%nAll in all, the Tier 2 Rocket makes things a lot easier by letting you mine ores on Mars and Phobos to get Uranium and Tungstate/Scheelite. However, building it requires considerable progression in EV, due to TPV Coils, which need Titanium and Platinum, and the Mainframes that the rocket needs. In IV, fluid nukes are one of the best choices for efficient power without a lot of setup, although it's very viable to use Thorium and not just Uranium, so you can ignore Uranium Fuel Rods and use fluid nukes in EV if you so wish.%n%nEither way, it's recommended to have a multiblock Miner in either the Nether or Phobos, to source your Thorium or Uranium.

# Quest: Thorium vs. Uranium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgQ.name=Thorium vs. Uranium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgQ.desc=Thorium and Uranium have a lot of differences, but also a lot of similarities.%n%nIn general, Uranium is a better fuel, but fluid nukes do not follow that general rule. Because they do not output any EU/t, and simply convert heat to Hot Coolant, the difference between the two fuels becomes minimal and Thorium stands out as being much easier to get and turn into fuel rods. The maximum amount of heat you can safely move around in a reactor limits the amount of Uranium Fuel Rods you can use, which means that your HU value will not be as high as you would have wanted.%n%nFor regular and vacuum IC2 nukes, however, Uranium has a big advantage. Especially in vacuum nukes, which are the most powerful, the efficient cooling through the cells makes it so a lot of Uranium can be processed at once, which returns incredible amounts of EU/t. The different conversion from fuel to energy between fluid and vacuum means that Thorium is very good for fluid nukes, whereas Uranium is very good for vacuum nukes.

# Quest: Max Danger Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgg.name=Max Danger Nukes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgg.desc=Were you courageous enough to build a vac nuke? If so, are you courageous enough to do it in a MOX setup, with high heat?%n%nYes, this is possible, and extremely powerful. However, all the risks you signed up for are exponentially increased, since MOX nukes keep getting better and better the closer the nuke's temperature is to the critical point. This sort of automation is more complicated than almost any other, and I honestly don't have any specific guidelines for you. %n%nIf you manage this, do share it on the Discord. I bet people will be surprised.

# Quest: Duranium and the Cyclotron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgw.name=Duranium and the Cyclotron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgw.desc=In the previous quest, Duranium was introduced as a material used to make Tritanium. While it becomes required for this reason, there is more to it than that. Another recipe that uses it is a Cyclotron recipe, which has a chance to produce a Quantum Anomaly. %n%nFirst off, what is the Cyclotron? That is a multiblock that works a bit like fusion, but only for the purpose of making new materials. It collides single particles with one another, or against fluids, to generate new items while consuming power. Most of the recipes it has won't be very useful, if at all, but it can also make Quantum Anomalies. This is a chance craft, but the Anomaly has a special property: when used to convert some blocks to others, it will not be consumed. Therefore, for that purpose, you only need to get one.%n%nIs this required? Well, yes. When you arrive at a certain stage of the game, you might find yourself needing a new kind of soldering alloy, called Mutated Living Solder. To craft this, you need a Chemical Plant made with Botmium, which is an alloy that required Advanced Nitinol. This, in turn, is one of the blocks that need a Quantum Anomaly for its conversion. Given that Duranium is the only fluid choice to make the Anomaly, then it becomes required for this as well, but only a couple tiers from ZPM.%n%nAdditionally, there are other recipes, like the Elemental Duplicator. This is a very powerful replicator that will give you a great boost in automation due to its speed and the replication recipes it can do, but the Quantum Anomaly used in this recipe will be consumed, so watch out: if you only have one, don't use it for this. Later on, however, you will encounter other recipes that consume the anomaly, namely the casings for the Quantum Force Transformer, so it will be important to automate their production by then.

# Quest: The End of Fusion Materials
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhA.name=The End of Fusion Materials
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhA.desc=There are only so many required fusion materials, which you've already gone through at this point. There are many more recipes, many of which have been listed in the quests so far, but also some that are yet to be tackled.%n%nThis, however, is the endgame. If you look at NEI, there are some recipes with EU/T and start EU values that are higher than what t3 fusion can offer, which suggests that there is yet another tier. The reality is that t4 fusion does exist, but it's more for bragging rights than real usefulness, alongside being much more expensive and harder to make than any of the other reactors. There is a quest for this in the "Endgame Goals" page, should you have unlocked that.%n%nAmong the last materials, you will find Flerovium, Rhugnor and, finally, Hypogen. They don't have a lot of possible uses for most of the pack, but Hypogen becomes essential in the endgame, where it becomes part of the coil block progression, as well as being used in some recipes as wires. If you truly want to walk towards the stargate, you will need to craft many stacks of this.

# Quest: Reactors are Expensive!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhQ.name=Reactors are Expensive!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhQ.desc=Your first t1 Fusion Reactor is one of the biggest walls to overcome throughout this pack's progression. It's very unlikely you can afford to just build another one right after, so you will have to manage several reactions with that single one.%n%nThe new fusion condition is that you will have to pay a cost of EU and time every time you switch the recipe that's being crafted. Assuming you're using fusion power, the production of Europium and any other material should be batched between your usual rows of power generation. Perhaps you're overproducing power? In that case, you can use the pause to fuse some useful materials.%n%nIn time, you will be able to afford and use multiple fusion reactors. For now, this isn't the case.

# Quest: Establishment of Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhg.name=Establishment of Fusion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhg.desc=Fusion is the lategame. It is not the entire lategame, but several tiers are effectively relying on it, even if new ways of generating power are being discovered (developed) over time. Whether you got here through focusing on power or products, you have surely felt the importance of that donut on your base, have you not? Let's just hope your power storage doesn't run out when you start relying on Mega Blast Furnace processing.%n%nIf you've looked at NEI enough, you might have discovered Force Plasma, or some of its crafting steps. This plasma is the end of the first of three fusion chains dedicated to power generation, although some of these special plasmas transform into useful materials in Plasma Turbines or Extreme Heat Exchangers, like Celestial Tungsten later on. There are three of these chains, and the build on top of one another: one for Mk1 Reactors, another for Mk2 and the last for Mk3. %n%nYou can build these chains any time you like, and they offer more EU/t per Fusion Reactor than the Helium Plasma alternative, but it's unlikely you'll need them this early. They only become really useful later on, at the Mk3 stage with bigger reactors and turbines. Despite the fact the three plasmas can be used for power, only the final one, Celestial Tungsten, is powerful enough to be worthwhile for your central power generation.

# Quest: A Second Reactor?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhw.name=A Second Reactor?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMhw.desc=At this point, why not? You should be a in a better position to afford it, but there is the issue that t3 fusion unlocks an easier Americium recipe, which lets you craft a second t3 more easily. You might not want to wait that long, maybe you've been smelting a lot of ingots, or using World Accelerators?%n%nRegardless, two Helium Plasma reactors will surely suffice for whatever it is you're doing. Tin Plasma is worth using, of course, but the Molecular Transformer recipe to convert Silver to Tin isn't available in the singleblock anymore, so you might want the easier option, since you're rocking two reactors and all. With the 2x overclock they're still produce millions of EU/t with the right Plasma Turbines, assuming you have them ready.%n%nIf you want to continue expanding, you can look at the Mk2 fusion chain that ends at Runite Plasma. This process uses Force Plasma from the Mk1 fusion chain, so it needs those 5 fusion recipes, plus another 5. Despite being an extremely powerful powergen option, it's unlikely you need something in this scale right now. Keep in mind, however, that you might need it in UHV or UEV.

Unlike the Oxygen Bubble Distributor, the Oxygen Sealer confines the oxygen to the room it is in. The sealer must be supplied with power and sufficient oxygen. See Oxygen Collector for supplying oxygen.%n%nThe sealer will only work in a room that is completely sealed off from outer space. This can be achieved with either a completely closed off room, or with an Air Lock. The sealer must have nothing above it to block its vents. It is designed to check for a proper seal about every 5 seconds, so be sure to give it time to seal.%n%nEach sealer requires at least 320 air points per second to work continuously or it will fail.

Mobs that are immune to poison, like Zombies and Skeletons, will not lose health.%n%nThey grow from the bottom face of a solid block down to 1 block away from the floor.%n%nCavernous vines can be broken by hand without taking damage or being poisoned but they will drop nothing. They can be obtained as an item using shears. Even picks with Silk Touch enchant will not obtain anything.%n%nOnce obtained, they can be replanted elsewhere and regrow, like cactus.%n%n§3That said, they're still useless.

# Quest: Slimeling
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFvw.name=Slimeling
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFvw.desc=The Slimeling is a utility mob that spawns from Slimeling Eggs found on the surface of Mars. It shares some features from vanilla wolves and mules: it can be tamed and attacks mobs that threaten its owners, and can be equipped with a special chest to transport items.%n%nAs an allied mob, Slimelings will actively help and follow the player-owner and will attempt to protect them. They can also have a neutral behavior, that is, they can attack if provoked or hurt by non-owners.%n%nItems that you can feed Slimelings with:%n%nBoat%nCooked fish%nGunpowder%nGold ingot%nRedstone repeater%nWooden door%n%nSlimelings can be equipped by their owners with a Slimeling Inventory Bag to transport items.%n%nTo complete this quest get any one of the eggs - note you may need a Heavy Duty Pickaxe.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKhw.desc=So if you thought 'hey, the purple stuff wasn't that bad, why not make the green?', well, first of all, you may need professional help. Second, you're going to need to be in ZPM to make the casings you need, full stop. You need a ZPM ABS for the components, so come back once you've made a ZPM Energy Hatch.%n%nYou can probably figure most of it out on your own, but keep in mind that some of the materials need to be created in the ABS, solidified, macerated, and then used in another ABS recipe. The examples here are Hastelloy-N for Lafium Compound and, Rhenium for Laurenium. Rhenium itself is made with a nonstandard ABS recipe. You alse need Dysprosium which requires either making Rare Earth (III) or going to the Toxic Everglades. And either Rare Earth (II) or Rare Earth (III) for Ytterbium unless, again, you visit the Everglades for it. §cThe Everglades ore veins might be very hard to find, due to their rarity.§r You could also get Ytterbium from Almandine Ore if you are willing to try GT++ Milling and Froth Floatation.%n%nHave fun with that!%n%n§3You'll almost certainly need more than this, but the exact amount, as always, depends on your hatches and busses.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL3Q.desc=You might have already wondered: There are these enormous gas planets in the solar system - isn't there a way to "harvest" them? Indeed there is. By constructing the "Planetary Gas Siphon" multiblock, you are able to pump from the infinite supply of gas found on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. You just need to build a space station around a gas planet to get near enough to be able to reach the gas without falling into it.%n%nBy pumping on different depths, you are able to extract different gases. The depth is controlled by a Programmed Circuit. You need to supply 64 * depth Mining Pipes to be able to rach the selected depth.%n%nWhile operational, the multiblock needs d*4^(t+2) EU/t (t is the space station's tier and d is the depth).%n%nYou can find an overview of what you can pump where in the Tips and Tricks chapter.

# Quest: A T0 Rocket? What?
betterquesting.quest.Oiy66UDmTVeZ95pN0yunBg.name=A T0 Rocket? What?
betterquesting.quest.Oiy66UDmTVeZ95pN0yunBg.desc=You can't use this rocket to go to any planet or moon §oand§r it's the most expensive one - a bad deal? Not quite! The Shuttle Rocket is used to create and access a §1§lMothership§r.%n%nThe Shuttle Rocket needs the same fuel as the T8 Rocket.


## Quest Line: Basic Automation
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADg.name=Basic Automation
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADg.desc=Steve's Carts and ProjectRed automation, for your auto-farming and auto-crafting needs, lag included!

# Quest: Your First Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAag.name=Your First Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAag.desc=Well, probably not the first, but definitely something big! You'll need a cart assembler first.

# Quest: Cart Modules: Coal Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaw.name=Cart Modules: Coal Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaw.desc=Your cart needs power, obviously. A cart can be powered via coal, solar, or lava. But for now you have to use a simple coal engine.

# Quest: Automated (un-)Loading
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbA.name=Automated (un-)Loading
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbA.desc=You can fill and empty your cart manually, but it's a lot more convenient to automate item transfer, isn't it?

# Quest: Cart Modules: Farming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbQ.name=Cart Modules: Farming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbQ.desc=Unfortunately, the basic farmer can't farm anything besides wheat, carrots and potatoes. It's not expensive at all, and probably the cheapest solution to give your automated food production a nice boost.

# Quest: Cart Modules: Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbg.name=Cart Modules: Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbg.desc=A basic cart can't hold any items, so you need to attach special chests to it.

# Quest: A Simple Cart
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbw.name=A Simple Cart
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbw.desc=In order to create or customize your cart you need a hull to attach your desired upgrades to. The wooden one can be used for really simple applications, but to farm wheat or wood, you need at least an iron one.%n%n§c§lWARNING: §r§cUnprotected carts can be knocked off their rails by lightning. Cover the area with glass (or any solid block) to prevent carts from disappearing.%n%nAlso, make sure to keep your cart in one chunk, or use chunkloaders covering the whole area the cart works within. Loading/unloading chunks may cause carts to disappear or duplicate.

# Quest: Cart Modules: Wood Cutter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcA.name=Cart Modules: Wood Cutter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcA.desc=The basic wood cutter will break after a while, but you never have to replace it. It can easily be repaired with diamonds.

# Quest: Project red beginning
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAfw.name=Project red beginning
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAfw.desc=Welcome to Project Red!%n%nThis quest will teach you the basics of Projectred and show you how to set up a Ghetto AE system.%n%nThe Ghetto AE system will be really useful for sorting all of your first items%n%nFirst of all there are different types of pipes: %n%nItem Transport pipes are the most basic pipes, classified as Null-logic. They don't do anything besides connect other pipes together.%nItem Transport pipes only have the ability to take items that enter it and pass them along to another connected pipe. They will NOT connect to inventories at all. In a junction where there is more than 1 possible direction, item payloads will travel in a randomly selected direction.%n %nRouted pipes are the most advanced. These pipes 'communicate' with one-another to form pipe networks, in order to allow for incredibly complicated demand driven systems, with absolutely no redstone circuitry required.%n %nPressurized pipes are pipes that use a pressure based routing system where the payload travels to the closest inventory that can accept it. Finding the closest inventory is influenced by both distance and Pressure Resistance Pipes (which, to the path finder, are 1000 blocks long), but the actual path that items take is only influenced by distance.%n%nHowever, in order to control the logic of the routed pipes you will need special circuit chips.%n%n§4Note: I have no idea how PR works, or if this questline is entirely a duplicate, and have zero willpower to read all the boring text and find out, so I just unhid them since no one came forward with any info after I asked. If it should be removed or w/e, make a ticket.

# Quest: Can u eat those?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC4Q.name=Can u eat those?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC4Q.desc=No you can't eat them but you can add them to your routed pipes. Without chips routed pipes can't do anything on their own, chips also have a GUI to configure them which can be opened by right clicking. %nThere are 8 types of chips:%n%n-Item extractor chip can be used to send items from its inventory to responder, dynamic responder, terminator and overflow responder chips in a pipe network. %n%n-Item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network which match the filter configured to the inventory connected to the responder chip. Chips with higher priority value will receive items first until the inventory is full then will be sent to other inventories with valid filters and remaining space.%n%n-Dynamic item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network that match items inside the dynamic item responder connected inventory. This chip has to be in the same interface pipe as the item responder chip in order to work. Priority rules apply here as well. %n%n-Item overflow responder works exactly the same as the item responder chip, however it only accepts items that cannot go to an item responder chip, dynamic item responder chip, or item terminator chip. %n%n-Item terminator chip works as a backup for responder chips.%n%n-Item broadcaster chip will show you the inventory connected to the routed request pipe on the pipe network and can be used to retrieve items from it. They can also extract from the side you configure. %n%n-Item stock keeper chip will constantly check the network for items and pull them to its pipe. If the chip is set to pull when empty, it will only pull if the inventory next to it is empty, otherwise it will pull when there are less items in the inventory than configured in the chip.%n%n-Item crafting chips craft things. %n%n-Item crafting extension chips are placed inside the item crafting chips. Make sure you randomize the id.

# Quest: Routed Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC4g.name=Routed Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC4g.desc=There are six types of routed pipes: %n%n-Junction pipe is used to form an intersection that will allow other routed pipes to communicate. %n%n-Interface pipe will connect to an inventory allowing you to extract or insert items, chips can be used to control the logic. %n%n-Request pipe will allow requesting only specific items to be send through pipes.%n%n-Firewall pipe can control which items can pass through them.

# Quest: Ghetto ME System
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC4w.name=Ghetto ME System
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC4w.desc=§4Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will kill TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.§r%n%nNow that you are familiar with the mod it's time to organize items in your base a bit. These are the things you need in order to get a basic extract/insert system.%n%nFirst of all you will need a drawer controller. You can pick it from here or craft it yourself and place it down. Next to it add as much drawers as you want, and make sure they are touching each other or the controller.%n%nThe next step is to connect a routed interface pipe to your drawer controller. Take the item responder chip and configure it to filter mode: blacklist (this will allow you to get any items from your system) and add the chip to the routed interface pipe by right clicking on it. Don't forget the dynamic item responder.%n%nIn order to allow your system to be able to see items you need to add the item broadcast chip TO THE SAME ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE DRAWER CONTROLLER.%n%nThe last step is to connect a routed request pipe IN THE SAME NETWORK AS THE ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE and right click it to access the GUI. You can only extract items from it. In order to insert items simply right click them on the drawer controller. %n%nYou can find more complex tutorials on youtube for autocrafting.

# Quest: Cart Modules: Solar Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEuA.name=Cart Modules: Solar Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEuA.desc=Your cart needs power, obviously. A cart can be powered via coal, solar or lava. If you are able to make solar panels you can power your cart with the sun.

# Quest: Cart modules: Digging
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEuQ.name=Cart modules: Digging
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEuQ.desc=Want to automate digging for ores ? A drill head made out of iron is the cheapest alternative.

# Quest: Cart Modules: Thermal Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEug.name=Cart Modules: Thermal Engine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEug.desc=Your cart needs power, obviously. A cart can be powered via coal, solar or lava. Why not power your cart with lava?

# Quest: Cart Modules: More Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEuw.name=Cart Modules: More Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEuw.desc=After you craft side chests you can add more different chests to the cart. Some sides are reserved for tools so no chest can be placed there.

# Quest: Input chest for Ghetto ME System
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGDA.name=Input chest for Ghetto ME System
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGDA.desc=To be able to put items into the Ghetto ME system you need just a few additional pipes.%nThe Extraction pipe should be connected to the chest you want to take items from.%nInside the Extraction pipe you need to put the Item Extraction chip, and configure it to blacklist if you want it to take all items from the chest.%n%nThe Routed Junction pipe is needed so the items inside the pipes know which direction to take, without this they will just fly around inside the pipes without knowing where to go.%nYou might also need some additional item transport pipes depending on your setup.

# Quest: More Seed Types
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGDg.name=More Seed Types
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGDg.desc=This fancy addon allows your cart to plant/harvest more seed types. If you have an MV+ centrifuge you might want to look at glowflowers for some free redstone and gold.%n%n§3You can't harvest IC2 crops with carts, so give up on that.

# Quest: More Tree Types
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGDw.name=More Tree Types
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGDw.desc=The standard wood cutter can only chop down (and replant) vanilla trees. If you want to use saplings from other mods however this addon will come in handy. Who knows - maybe you're tired of clicking rubber trees with a treetap.

# Quest: Further Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEA.name=Further Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEA.desc=If you want to load and unload a lot of different items from your cargo manager the pipes can get quite messy. The external distributor is a block you can place next to your cargo manager and it will help you to access different slots which you can specify in its GUI. Quite handy for pumping items in and out!

# Quest: Advanced Detector Rail
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEQ.name=Advanced Detector Rail
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEQ.desc=Now that you have a cargo manager you need a specific rail so that your cart can interact with it. Just place it next to the cargo manager, depending on the color of the side it is on you will have to adjust settings in the cargo manager GUI.

# Quest: Let's Get Some Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGVw.name=Let's Get Some Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGVw.desc=First we're gonna need some pipes to connect everything. Do not use these pipes in junctions or the items will choose which path to go at random and you don't want that.%n%n§3Keep in mind PR automation is laggy, so don't use it more than the minimum you can get away with on servers, wait until AE2 for that. In SP, do what you want, but keep in mind that AE2 is way more powerful.

# Quest: Junctions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWA.name=Junctions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWA.desc=So how do we deal with junctions then? We use these pipes. They are smart and they will send everything where it needs to go, so if you make a junction make sure you put this pipe there.

# Quest: Interacting With Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWQ.name=Interacting With Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWQ.desc=That's all nice and all, but none of these pipes connect to chests and machines. What am I supposed to do with them?%n%nI'm glad you asked. You are going to need a special pipe for that. This is a pipe you need to use to connect to machines and chests. You'll have to set it up with chips that we'll make soon.

# Quest: Chips
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWg.name=Chips
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWg.desc=Now you need to make some chips to use in those interface pipes. These ones do not do anything but are needed as a material for crafting the others.%n%nNow would be a good time to look into IC2 crops to get all the dyes you will need for your advanced chips.%n%n§3If NEI's bookmarks are blocking you on the left, you can turn it off (O) until that gets fixed.

# Quest: Item Responder Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWw.name=Item Responder Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGWw.desc=This chip also stores items in connected invetory. It designates a storage for items that are set in the filter of this chip. They do not actively request for items, they only serve as a destination for items to go. You can open up the menu by rightclicking the chip. There you can set which items should it accept and the priority. Items will go to item responders with higher priority first.

# Quest: Item Overflow Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXA.name=Item Overflow Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXA.desc=This chip stores the items in a connected inventory. It designates a storage for items that have no other place to go. It is strongly recomended to have a default storage for items in every pipe system, otherwise bad stuff can happen. Best used with a large chest (diamond for example).%n%nIt seems to have some bugs though, so don't craft more than one without testing it first.%n%nYou might have to just use a normal item responder and add the items you want routed back to your overflow spot.

# Quest: Dynamic Item Responder
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXQ.name=Dynamic Item Responder
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXQ.desc=The dynamic item responder chip behaves exactly like an item responder chip, but instead of you setting up which items it should accept, it looks in the chest what items are there and those items it will accept.

# Quest: Item Extractor Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXg.name=Item Extractor Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXg.desc=This chip will extract items from the connecting inventory. The extracted items then look for pipes with item responder chips where there's a free space they could go. If they don't find any they will go to the overflow default storage chest.%n%nIf you want it to extract everything leave the filter empty and set it to blacklist.

# Quest: Item Broadcaster
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXw.name=Item Broadcaster
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGXw.desc=The item broadcaster is a chip that tells everything in the pipe system what items it has in the connecting inventory and if another chip needs anything it will send it to them. Right click it to set the items it will transmit. If you leave it empty and set to blacklist it will transmit everything.%n%nDefinitely use one in combination with an item overflow chip on your default storage chest. That way overflow will end up in the chest, but will be useable by the rest of your system.

# Quest: Item Stock Keeper Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYA.name=Item Stock Keeper Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYA.desc=The item stock keeper looks at the connecting inventory and keeps item stocked in there. If the item is missing it will keep bothering item broadcasters every few seconds if they have the item and if they can send it. It's basically like an annoying child. %n%nIt is really useful though. Want a chest that will always have 64 cobble and dirt in it and if you take them they will get replaced? This guy is perfect for that job. It's great for keeping machines stocked. When stocking GT machines, the top left slot of the 3x3 is equal to the left slot of the machine. Want a chemical reactor that keeps 3 hydrogen cells ready to go to make ammonia, just add nitrogen? This is the chip for you.

# Quest: Crafting Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYQ.name=Crafting Chip
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYQ.desc=The crafting chip does exactly what it says. It's not just for default crafting. You can use it with GT machines. Just put in the matrix that it should insert and the output is what it should extract. A great use for them is in combination with fluid canners or super tanks for filling cells. I would strongly recommend not overusing them. Wait untill you have access to AE2 for autocrafting stuff.

# Quest: Request Pipe
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYg.name=Request Pipe
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYg.desc=This pipe lets you request stuff from the system. It shows all items that are available thanks to broadcast chips and even stuff that can be crafted thanks to crafting chips.

# Quest: Simple Storage System
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYw.name=Simple Storage System
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGYw.desc=§4Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will tank TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.§r%n%nTime to build a simple system to store your stuff. Place down the drawer controller and place the drawers around it. Connect the interface pipe to the drawer controller and put the dynamic item responder and broadcaster chips inside. Don't forget to set the broadcaster to transmit everything by leaving the filter empty and setting it to blacklist. Now you can request stuff from your storage and if you have a chest with a pipe and extractor chip everything you put inside will be sorted into the storage.

# Quest: Desulfurizing Oil Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGZA.name=Desulfurizing Oil Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGZA.desc=This quest line will show you how to automate desulfurizing of oil products. Return here once you have unlocked the LV distillery quest and have some polyethylene plates.

# Quest: Storing the Fluids

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGZQ.desc=First we should make a place to store all the fluids we'll use.%n%nIf you're interested what they'll be used for:%n1 for oxygen%n1 for hydrogen%n1 for sulfuric acid

# Quest: Electrolyzing Water
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGZg.name=Electrolyzing Water
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGZg.desc=Now let's automate electrolyzing water into oxygen and hydrogen. You'll need hydrogen for tons of stuff including desulfurization, obtaining tungsten, and nitric acid production. Oxygen is also useful as I'm sure you noticed when making steel.%n%nHow to set it up:%n%nPlace the electrolyzer down and connect it to water and electricity. Place the 2 super tanks nearby. Set the electrolyzer to produce hydrogen gas and oxygen cells. Use normal GT fluid pipes to output the hydrogen gas into one super tank. That is now your hydrogen storage. Now connect interface pipes to all 3 machines.%n%nFor the electrolyzer put in item stock keeper set to keep 2 empty cells stored. Also put in extractor set to extract oxygen cells.%n%nNow for the oxygen storage put it item responder chip set to accept oxygen cells and extractor set to extract empty cells.%n%nNow put some empty cells inside your default storage chest and don't forget to have a broadcaster there.

# Quest: Desulfurizing the Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGZw.name=Desulfurizing the Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGZw.desc=Now it's time to start the actual desulfurization. Use a chemical reactor of your choice, fill it with sulfuric light fuel and hook it to power. Now connect an interface pipe to it. Put an item stock keeper inside set to store 4 hydrogen cells. Then put in item extractor set to extract hydrogen sulfide and empty cells.%n%nGo to your hydrogen storage super tank and put in a crafting chip set to make one hydrogen cell from one empty cell.%n%nAnd that's all.

# Quest: Dealing with H2S
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGaA.name=Dealing with H2S
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGaA.desc=Now let's convert all that H2S into sulfuric acid. Hook up a chemical reactor to electricity, water and interface pipe. Put inside an item responder chip set to accept H2S cells and extract empty cells. Distill that diluted sulfuric acid in distillery and store it in super tank.%n%nCongratulations. You now have a completely automatic desulfuring of oil, automatic production of hydrogen and oxygen and you also store all that sulfuric acid.

# Quest: Small Reward
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGaQ.name=Small Reward
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGaQ.desc=Here's a small reward for making all those chips.

# Quest: Reward for Desulfurizing Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGag.name=Reward for Desulfurizing Automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGag.desc=The greatest reward is having your stuff automated if you've done everything correctly, but here's a reward for making it this far.%n%nSome other setups to look at automating are making polyethylene and nitric acid. %n%nWith stock keeper chips you can always keep a set amount on-hand and when you pull out the cells to use elsewhere, your setup will automatically make more.

# Quest: Does Anyone Even Still Use These?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKng.name=Does Anyone Even Still Use These?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKng.desc=If you do, they're now really good. I guess. They sound like it at least?

Back in your home root let's now type startup and you'll see it display "Hello World!"  neat huh?%n%nLet's now make startup actually work on startup. Type 'edit .shrc' .shrc is a mystic file that runs shell commands when booting your PC. So in .shrc type 'startup' save and reboot the computer. Now it should say "Hello World!" upon starting. Double neat right?

# Quest: I Love Pressing the F5 Key.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG4g.name=I Love Pressing the F5 Key.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG4g.desc=It's so refreshing.%n%nPlace a keyboard facing a screen, or stuck to the back of a screen to make it able to interact with a computer.%n%nAbsolutely necessary to doing anything on your computer, but can safely be removed once you have an endlessly running program.

# Quest: Mounting Your HDD
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG4w.name=Mounting Your HDD
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG4w.desc=Alright, you have your computer, it says "Hello World!" When you start it, and you feel awesome and capable of world domination. %n%nNow lets setup your HDD. Open .shrc again in the editor, and press ENTER to go down a line after the print, and type in 'cd ../' this will move your viewed directory that's being viewed to the absolute base directory.  %n%nNow go down another line and type in 'mount HDD C:' because why not, it's Classic; this mounts the file drive into the folder you're in. Go down another line and type cd 'C:/' save and reboot the computer.%n%nYou'll now start in C:/ nifty! Try typing 'mkdir programs' and now you have a dedicated directory to put your programs in for the sake of organization.%n'cd programs' will then take you to programs, and 'cd ../' will take you back a directory; you can also do things like, lets say you have a folder called apples in C as well but you're in apples, type 'cd ../apples' and it'll take you to apples. '..' essentially just means previous directory and this can be stacked; works with copying files and moving them as well, very useful to know.  %n%nBut right now we're going to do something functional, come over to the next quest and bring your adapter and cables.

# Quest: Basic Power Display
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG5A.name=Basic Power Display
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG5A.desc=For this part we will learn how to use our adapter, place it next to, let's say your EBFs battery buffer and connect it to the computer with cables.%nNow lets type in lua while on the computer to open the LUA environment where we can test things without worrying about saving and trying our program.%n%nType in 'component.list()' this will display a table of all of .list from component. What we're looking for is gt_batterybuffer.%nIf you have too many nearby things it may not display and the way to search the entire list of components is too advanced for starters.%n%nSo now assign a variable to it; for example 'a = component.gt_batterybuffer'; now we can call 'a' to see what methods the batteryBuffer has.%nWhat we'll be using in this example is the 'getBatteryCharge' method. So type  'a.getBatteryCharge(1)' this will call the method getBatteryCharge from the first inventory slot on the gt_batterybuffer in component.%n%nSo if we're using a 2x2 battery buffer; we can type something like, 'for i=1, 4 do print(a.getBatteryCharge(i)) end'%nPoof you now see what all the batteries EU values. Now what can we do with this?%n%nTry making a variable called 'batteryCharge = 0', now do 'for i=1, 4 do batteryCharge = batteryCharge + a.getBatteryCharge(i) end'%n%nNow print(batteryCharge) will display the total charge. Here's a program example of this being used.%n%nPlace in your tape drive and type 'install', and follow the promps to install it into C. Then edit it, test it, figure how it works.%n%nI suppose that's enough for now; congrats! Experiment and learn, and don't forget to check google as much as possible!  %nThis questline will be updated again in the future; but I figure this is a good ending point for now.

# Quest: I NEED THAT!!!!!!
betterquesting.quest.tT0NrRMyTqePf1jeIx7krw.name=I NEED THAT!!!!!!
betterquesting.quest.tT0NrRMyTqePf1jeIx7krw.desc=A lot of recipes take fluids. But crafting modules only have slots for items...%n%nIntroducing the Fluid Crafting Upgrade. It will allow you to allocate one kind of fluid for the craft. Drag one fluid cell containing the fluid you need into the fluid slot and set the correct amount.%n%nDon't forget to bind it to a fluid satellite pipe. The way it binds is identical to the satellite logistics pipe.

# Quest: Satellites! Wait,... They don't Orbit...
betterquesting.quest.y2mOWnXvRe2xWrdvVS297w.name=Satellites! Wait,... They don't Orbit...
betterquesting.quest.y2mOWnXvRe2xWrdvVS297w.desc=A buffer of 64 per slot is never big enough. Just look at red alloy ingot for example. It can only hold 16 recipes worth of redstone at once. You don't really want the items to just zoom around the pipes while waiting for the machine to make room... You want to have a big chest buffering items to be processed.%n%nIntroducing the Satellite Logistics Pipes. It provides additional input into the recipe incorporating it.%n%nThe pipe runs on a numerical frequency system, with the whole server sharing the number pool. This ensures that 2 separate systems can be connected to each other without conflict.%n%nYou can "connect" a crafting module with one satellite pipe by selecting the correct frequency of the satellite part. Multiple modules can connect to a single satellite pipe.%n%nSatellite pipe inputs are the 3 grey slots on the right of the 9 slots of the module. Only items in the 3 grey slots will be sent to satellite pipes.%n%n§cNote: Ensure your satellite pipe has any frequency other than 0. A satellite pipe with frequency 0 will not work.

# Quest: Upgrades
betterquesting.quest.3wK8pIDKSOii1__bwf6Ycw.name=Upgrades
betterquesting.quest.3wK8pIDKSOii1__bwf6Ycw.desc=You want to automate recipes involving fluids, but the crafting module only accept items? You want to see how machines are handling recipes in the request table to see if something gets stuck? You will need §lupgrades§r.%n%nYou can apply upgrades to pipes and modules, but you can't just access the upgrade menu by right clicking the chassis with a wrench.%n%nIntroducing the Logistics Pipe Controller. This item is like a wrench for LP, except it will open the upgrades menu. It can also allow you to view statistics related to the pipe you are accessing.

# Quest: Filtering by Type
betterquesting.quest.5rc45iPDSmqLbuvcioFDEQ.name=Filtering by Type
betterquesting.quest.5rc45iPDSmqLbuvcioFDEQ.desc=There are situations where there are a large amount of the same type of items, but the quantity of each aren't large enough to get them dedicated storage...%n%nThe Type Filter ItemSink Module can assign an item type to inventory space it is connected to. All items of the same type will be assigned to that inventory space.

# Quest: Fluid Storage
betterquesting.quest.7O4n10fJSxme0Bs0_n44xg.name=Fluid Storage
betterquesting.quest.7O4n10fJSxme0Bs0_n44xg.desc=Logistics Pipes can handle fluids.%n%nThere are multiple pipes for fluids in logistics pipes. Logistics Fluid Basic Pipe will be the one you will be mainly using.%n%nYou can attach it to a tank, assign a fluid to it, and it will assign the buffer tank for that fluid. Basically a fluid version of the ItemSink.

# Quest: Pls Provide
betterquesting.quest.7_AtC62nTAKG1nTYoyS-8g.name=Pls Provide
betterquesting.quest.7_AtC62nTAKG1nTYoyS-8g.desc=Just like items which have itemsink modules for storage and provider modules for request, fluids have basically the equivalent pipes.%n%nThe Logistics Fluid Provider Pipe will do the job. It will provide the fluid to other pipes and machines connected to them that need the fluid.

# Quest: Crafting on Demand
betterquesting.quest.8CwALDydSAaz9GGQm5tB-g.name=Crafting on Demand
betterquesting.quest.8CwALDydSAaz9GGQm5tB-g.desc=We can now request items, but it sucks when the systems lack the component while we CAN craft those components.%n%nThe system needs to know how to craft the items it is requesting.%n%nTo get started, get a crafting module. Both automation of machine-crafted recipes and crafting table recipes need this module, in one way or another.%n

# Quest: Chassis
betterquesting.quest.9OtAPqTQQBaCixJITgpnFg.name=Chassis
betterquesting.quest.9OtAPqTQQBaCixJITgpnFg.desc=Basic Pipes can interact with adjacent blocks, but they also don't do much on their own. %n%nLogistics Pipes has modules that provide the pipes with more complex functions, but the Basic Logistics Pipes can't make use of them.%n%nTo make use of the modules, there are special pipes called Chassis. %n%nThere are multiple tiers of Chassis in Logistics Pipes. For now, a Mk 1, which can hold 1 module, will work.%n%nYou can insert modules directly in the chassis by right clicking said chassis with the module. But if you need to take modules out of a chassis or configure a module in one, you need to right click the chassis with a wrench to access its UI.

# Quest: Preparin' for Requestin'
betterquesting.quest._XiSkFhJQ8-WjqujCxBtlw.name=Preparin' for Requestin'
betterquesting.quest._XiSkFhJQ8-WjqujCxBtlw.desc=Logistics Pipes have automation capability in place, but first, it needs to know what inventory that items inside can be used for requests.%n%nThe Provider module does this job nicely. When you open the interface of the module, there is a 3*3 grid. you can pick what items that the module can provide, or you can leave it empty as "everything in the inventory can be provided for requests".

# Quest: Troubleshooting...
betterquesting.quest.EfJnTMxuTMKc5VhvNOxrYQ.name=Troubleshooting...
betterquesting.quest.EfJnTMxuTMKc5VhvNOxrYQ.desc=If you find your pipe has thick red corners, then it means something is wrong. Either the network is out of power or you formed a junction with an Unrouted Transport Pipe.%n%nWhen the system gets more complicated, the chances go up that something will go wrong. Have fun troubleshooting! :)

# Quest: Better Chassis
betterquesting.quest.FFDyUcsHTpiFg7_Yjr8vGA.name=Better Chassis
betterquesting.quest.FFDyUcsHTpiFg7_Yjr8vGA.desc=Now that storage is handled, you want to dive into the automation part?%n%nA Mk1 Chassis can't hold enough modules for complex functions. We need a better one.%n%nChassis Mk2 can hold 2 modules. It should do for now.

# Quest: Requestin' a Recipe
betterquesting.quest.FYOm8b1PRTKsyVjFdpBqjg.name=Requestin' a Recipe
betterquesting.quest.FYOm8b1PRTKsyVjFdpBqjg.desc=Most of the time you are requesting things because you need to craft something. So here is the Logistics Request Table.%n%nThis thing comes with a 3*3 crafting grid that you can load with a NEI recipe and request the recipe. There is also an inventory buffer that you can use to store items within.

# Quest: Sorting Incoming
betterquesting.quest.FkDubMYaQ5GKGvvfHZ73yw.name=Sorting Incoming
betterquesting.quest.FkDubMYaQ5GKGvvfHZ73yw.desc=Now that storage spaces are organized and assigned, time to let the network sort the items for us.%n%nThere are 2 ways to insert items into the system%n%n1. Use an extraction module to extract items into the system. It is slow, but everything that has a valid destination will be sent into the network.%n%n2. Use a QuickSort module. It extracts a whole stack of items that has a valid destination. This module will ignore items that have no destinations other than the default route though...%n%nIt is your choice. Pick what you like.

# Quest: More ItemSinks in NEI
betterquesting.quest.HA1vu57XQG-Na7rAPEFSDA.name=More ItemSinks in NEI
betterquesting.quest.HA1vu57XQG-Na7rAPEFSDA.desc=There are more kinds of ItemSink modules in NEI. Feel free to look through them to find the ItemSink module that suits your needs.%n%nHow they sort items and assign inventory spaces are mostly explained by their item names.

# Quest: The Basic Pipe
betterquesting.quest.HpeL1-zMRnKpYxYmLHqHaw.name=The Basic Pipe
betterquesting.quest.HpeL1-zMRnKpYxYmLHqHaw.desc=Unrouted Transport Pipes by themselves aren't useful.%n%nTime to use some of them to craft some Basic Logistics Pipes.%n%nThe Basic Logistics Pipes can connect to adjacent inventories and blocks. They also have item routing capabilities, so you can use them to form junctions.%n%nBut they also cost some diamonds...

# Quest: The Backbone of the System
betterquesting.quest.Ig-vbx9-R2alDVAybPGzLA.name=The Backbone of the System
betterquesting.quest.Ig-vbx9-R2alDVAybPGzLA.desc=Welcome to Logistics Pipes! This questline is dedicated to this automation mod, which is placed in the MV tier to help manage your chests, crafting and even fluid crafting. It's quite similar to ProjectRed: Transportation, but with some differences, particularly in fluid crafting. %n%nHere, you can connect chests and machines to a central location, but before you build that central location, you have to get some pipes for connection. The Unrouted Transport Pipe is the first pipe you will ever need in Logistics Pipes.%n%nThey only connect to other pipes and don't have any item routing capabilities, but you will need a ton of them.%n%n§cWarning: Do NOT form junctions with the Unrouted Transport Pipes. Items going into an unrouted transport pipe junction will come out of a random exit of the junction.

# Quest: There Is Extra Stuff...
betterquesting.quest.Ix6qrScZQPGnl3jEm9P2Ag.name=There Is Extra Stuff...
betterquesting.quest.Ix6qrScZQPGnl3jEm9P2Ag.desc=Sometimes, a recipe has some extra outputs but the crafting module only has 1 output slot.%n%nThat is where the Crafting Byproduct Extraction Upgrade comes in. You can assign a byproduct of the recipe and this upgrade will make the module extract the byproduct as well. Now they won't clog the output buffer.

# Quest: Remote requests
betterquesting.quest.MwRByyNxQt-LfGgUqm8QDQ.name=Remote requests
betterquesting.quest.MwRByyNxQt-LfGgUqm8QDQ.desc=Remote requests aren't always convenient. As long as you are in range with a request pipe, the remote orderer can take the order and send it to a request pipe the orderer binds to.%n%nPretty handy if you have an ender chest and an ender pouch...%n %n§3Author's note: Too bad ender chests and pouches are gated behind IV and thaumcraft... And why people would use a LP system at that point is really beyond me...

# Quest: Get Those Machines to Work
betterquesting.quest.N8isBrjBRNe-3f-IHVymDg.name=Get Those Machines to Work
betterquesting.quest.N8isBrjBRNe-3f-IHVymDg.desc=Most of the recipes are made in all kinds of machines. While a crafting logistics pipe works, it can only hold 1 recipe per pipe.%n%nIt is not an issue for logistics crafting tables as it can only hold one crafting table recipes, but it is wasteful to assign only one recipe for one machine.%n%nFor machines, use chassis. Preferably a higher tier. A Mk1 chassis with a crafting module is basically just a crafting logistics pipe.%n%nYou can't shift-click recipes from NEI so you have to drag the recipe from it. Don't worry, you can drag ghost items from NEI into the slots in the module to configure it.%n%nYou notice there are 3 grey slots at the right. They are for satellite logistics pipes. We will talk about it later.%n%n§cNote: do NOT use the output face of the machine. The output side blocks all interactions unless you hit it with a screwdriver.%n%nAlso do NOT use auto-output, or else the machine will output the item into the pipe and the network will treat the product as an item inserted into the system rather than an item requested by the system and will send it to its storage. Every other face except the cover works.§r%n%nThe checkmark means you have read the whole thing and should know how machine automation works using LP. The reward of this quest is the knowledge of how to automate GT machine recipes

# Quest: Let this Sink in
betterquesting.quest.TBZf_HtQTQ-yckug0fs8kA.name=Let this Sink in
betterquesting.quest.TBZf_HtQTQ-yckug0fs8kA.desc=A well organized storage system is crucial for a logistics system. %n%nWith the ability to use modules through a chassis, we can now prepare for storage modules.%n%nLogistics Pipes uses ItemSink modules to assign storage spaces.%n%nThis ItemSink modules can be used in 2 ways:%n%n1. Assign the storage of a connected inventory with at most 9 different kinds of items by setting 9 items as filter on the module.%n%n2. Assign a connected inventory as a default route. The default route is a destination for items that have no other valid storage spaces.%n%n§cNote: remember to always check if the default route has additional spaces because items that are stuck in the pipes without a destination will eventually YEET themselves out of the pipes.

# Quest: Time to Request
betterquesting.quest.VH7nGtkWRp-riK1I3cq5yw.name=Time to Request
betterquesting.quest.VH7nGtkWRp-riK1I3cq5yw.desc=Your system now has the capability of providing items for requests, time to request items.%n%nThis Request Logistics Pipe can send out requests that, if the network has items that can fulfill the requests, send the item to the pipe.%n%nAttach an inventory to it so that when items reach the request logistics pipe, they are stored in an inventory and don't getting yeeted out.

# Quest: Time to See The Process
betterquesting.quest.VISeokU3R-efeF88FwLGLw.name=Time to See The Process
betterquesting.quest.VISeokU3R-efeF88FwLGLw.desc=Want to see how the system is handling the request and fix it when you find things get stuck? Here is the upgrade for you.%n%nThe Crafting Monitoring Upgrade can let you view the current progress of the request. So if you find your crafting request is taking an abnormally long time and nothing is crafted by your machines, you may want to take a look here.%n%nIt can be applied to your Logistics Request Table.

# Quest: EVEN EVEN BETTER CHASSIS

betterquesting.quest.WTIyEmzLR_mlw__SXY_iwA.name=Inserting Fluids
betterquesting.quest.WTIyEmzLR_mlw__SXY_iwA.desc=Sometimes you insert fluid in the system. You need something to get the fluid into the correct buffer other than inserting the fluid into the buffer manually.%n%nThere are 2 pipes that can do the job: transfer fluid into a tank connected to a fluid basic pipe allocated to said fluid.%n%n1. Logistics Fluid Extractor Pipe. It extracts fluid from connected buffer to the correct big storage tank. It doesn't require a pump but it is slower.%n%n2. Logistics Fluid Insertion Pipe. It does not pull fluids from tanks actively, requiring a GT pump if you are using GT tanks, but it can send fluids faster.%n%nTake a pick :)

# Quest: It's DA BEST
betterquesting.quest.ZS2_l5v3R2-gh69ESL-FNQ.name=It's DA BEST
betterquesting.quest.ZS2_l5v3R2-gh69ESL-FNQ.desc=You still need MORE recipe slots for the crafting modules?%n%nThis one will cost you §lTITANIUM§r. Are you sure about that?%n%nYes? OK...%n%nHere is the final tier of chassis: Chassis Mk5. Instead of incrementing the number of modules it can hold by 1 compared to the last tier, it straight up doubles the slots. Hopefully you think it is worth it.

# Quest: It gets polymorphic
betterquesting.quest.bQCnuxrTTBe4ubytZPfl-g.name=It gets polymorphic
betterquesting.quest.bQCnuxrTTBe4ubytZPfl-g.desc=Sometimes people have a storage system that contains a lot of different items, or they have a large quantity of the same item.%n%nHere comes the Polymorphic ItemSink. It assigns inventory space to the kind of items already in the inventory.%n%nVery handy especially when you have a storage controller connecting to a lot of drawers.

# Quest: It's Storage Time!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAsg.name=It's Storage Time!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAsg.desc=To make an AE system, you'll need all 4 patterns, collect them all! If you hit EV without getting all of them, you can also make them yourself.%n%n§3BTW, you need a ton of Titanium to do AE2, so if you can't make it, you won't get much of anywhere.

# Quest: Gotta Find Them All
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAsw.name=Gotta Find Them All
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAsw.desc=There are a lot of meteors on the surface, but there are more underground. In order to find those, you'll want a compass. The compass will only tell you the chunk has an asteroid in it, with your ore finder wand you can get a better idea where in the chunk the meteor is hiding.%n%nFor more details on AE2, check out §9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Applied_Energistics_2[/url]§r.

# Quest: 16k Item Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtA.name=16k Item Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtA.desc=Middle tier storage cell, which can contain 16,384 bytes of storage. 16,384 bytes of storage can hold 2,032 stacks of a single item, or 1,040 stacks, while holding 63 different items. The 16k storage cell uses 128 bytes of data to store a single type.%n%nWhen placed inside a drive or chest will consume 1.5 ae/t.

# Quest: Fluix Crystals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtQ.name=Fluix Crystals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtQ.desc=Not "flux"! Even if the color is the same. You need to add redstone and nether quartz to a charged certus crystal.

# Quest: Applied Crafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtg.name=Applied Crafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtg.desc=Crafting can be a pain. So why not automate it? These can hold a single pattern each. However, if you place an ME interface against it, you can use it to craft any of the patterns in it. You can use multiple with the same MA, and given how expensive they are now, that might be a good idea. These do NOT require a channel, but do require network access.

# Quest: Getting Your First Processors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtw.name=Getting Your First Processors
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAtw.desc=There are 3 different ways to make AE2 processors. First, there's the AE2 Inscribers, which are slow, hold one of each item at a time, require inputs (and output) from specific directions, but can be sped up with cards. Second, there's the Advanced Inscribers, which are similar, but allow stacking, and do not require specific directions. Lastly, there's GT Assemblers (and later the multiblock) which can be very fast, but require a fluid input, and consume more power. Get 8 of each one for now.

# Quest: Cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAuA.name=Cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAuA.desc=To have access to your applied energistics network from your entire base, you'll need cables. A lot of them. For now, the basic ones will do, but eventually, you'll end up using dense cables and p2p channels. Glass and Covered cables are functionally identical, just different in looks. Each can carry 8 channels.  Quartz fibers don't carry channels but can carry energy. This is useful for providing power from your main network to independant subnetworks.%n%nYou can also color your cables - cables with different colors will not connect, so those can be used to expand network capacity by running parallel cables. Only fluix colored cables connect to all other colors. Later it will probably be more efficient to use P2P channels to jam a bunch of channels into 1.%n%nAnchors are like covers, keeping things from connecting when you don't want them to.

# Quest: Basic Terminals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAuQ.name=Basic Terminals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAuQ.desc=The ME Terminal is an interface which gives you access to an ME network's networked storage. It has the ability to sort and search, as well as filter by using a view cell.%n%nThe ME Crafting Terminal is the upgraded version of the ME terminal which has an integrated crafting grid with access to an ME network's networked storage.%n%nThe ME Interface Terminal gives remote access to all interface pattern slots on your network separated by which type of machine they are on. It will show the type of machine in the terminal, however you can name the ME interface in the inscriber or an anvil to alter the name displayed in the ME interface terminal. If you use Ender Chests to send stuff elsewhere to be processed a lot, this may help with reducing confusion. You can also search for a specific device.

# Quest: Bundled AE Channels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyw.name=Bundled AE Channels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyw.desc=P2P tunnels. You'll probably want a bunch of them! They act as teleport points from one place to another for the contained information.%n%nThey can pack up to 32 channels into 1 channel and transport those to the destination P2P bus. Each P2P tunnel requires 1 free channel. P2P connections cannot be nested, but one transport cable can carry multiple P2P connections. For a normal fluix cable, that's 4 P2P connections, and 16 for dense.%n%nYou can use separate cables to connect input p2ps to the controller and to transport from the controller to around your base, allowing for 32 output p2ps on one dense cable. Alternatively you can use an entirely separate controller as a transport network.%n%nGenerally, you'll want to have the first point be one side of an ME Controller block (remember you can add more!), and the other where some of your machines are.%n%nA nice online guide can be found at §9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Applied_Energistics_2[/url]§r under P2P tunnels.%n%nIf you want to use one of the P2P tunnels for something §oother§r than ME channels, use an applicable item on the center of the face of the tunnel, (for example, a GT cable for GT EU, redstone for RS signal, an RF conduit for RF, a torch for light, a bucket for fluid, a chest for items, or an OC cable for OC) and it will convert to that type, even if you pick it up. Use a fluix cable to change it back.

# Quest: Insurgence
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABbQ.name=Insurgence
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABbQ.desc=Is your infusion very slow? And, alas, to resolve that you need a world accelerator. That probably causes a lot of lag.%n%nWell no longer! Try out the new Infusion Interceptor. Read more about it on the Thaumic Insurgence page in your Thaumonomicon.

# Quest: A Digital Singularity
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1A.name=A Digital Singularity
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB1A.desc=What? You filled up the Quantum storage cell? I hope with something better than Cobblestone. Anyway, you better make something EVEN bigger then.%n%nHmm, adding even more storage capacity to a single cell would result in something so dense in information that it would just collapse into a singularity. So why not be smart about it. Just use an already existing singularity! Build a sturdy casing around it and some connecting components and you should be good. Better use an eternal singularity though to make sure things remain stable.%n%n%n§3The Digital Singularity can store more than 4 quintillion items. If you manage to fill one up, please contact the dev team so that they can ban you for cheating, ... eh I mean §ocongratulate you on your achievement§r§3, of course!

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFCg.desc=Charged certus quartz is one of the basic components for a lot of AE recipes. Just mix some certus quartz and redstone dust to get charged certus quartz dust.%n%nUse the autoclave to make crystals. Or if you have lots of sodium, you can use the chemical reactor recipe. You can also make the charger to go directly from crystal to charged crystal, but it's not very fast. The charger can connect directly to a GT cable or a fluix cable from the bottom.%n%n§3Note that some recipies only have a chance of producting a charged crystal, which is true of many of these.

# Quest: Keeping Your Network Happy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFCw.name=Keeping Your Network Happy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFCw.desc=Helps with fluctuating power. Energy cells store up to 200,000 AE. They do not accept power directly but are used to buffer some power in an already existing ME network. Energy Cells do not use a channel.

# Quest: Storing Your ME Data
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFDA.name=Storing Your ME Data
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFDA.desc=A block designed to do one thing, store storage cells. This block holds 10 storage cells so you can tightly pack your storage into a very small space. ME drives show their contents and the storage cell status on the front of the drive face.%n%nRed - Indicates the storage cell is full.%nOrange - Indicates the storage cell cannot hold any more types, but it can store more items.%nGreen - Indicates the cell can hold more types, or more items.%nBlack - Indicates there is no channel, or power is offline.%n%nIt's important to note, that without an ME Network this block does nothing. It's only useful when combined with a way to input, and output items, and requires 2 AE/t power to function, and additional power for each storage cell stored inside it.%n%nAbout Priority: Many devices in AE2 have a priority setting, this determines what gets items first. This is useful in some situations, but not so much in others. Higher number = higher priority.

# Quest: Speeding Up Growth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFDg.name=Speeding Up Growth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFDg.desc=Used to accelerate the process of purifying crystals, which allows you to create pure certus quartz crystal, pure nether quartz crystal and pure fluix crystal. Must be powered by an ME Network via the sides with the +, and consumes a steady 8 ae/t while plugged in. Crystal Seeds must be in an adjacent water block to be affected - the seeds will shimmer more rapidly when in the presence of a powered crystal growth accelerator. These do not use a channel.

# Quest: Perfecting Crystal Growth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFDw.name=Perfecting Crystal Growth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFDw.desc=The crystal growth chamber is used for fast crystal growth, and it is possible to increase its speed by installing acceleration cards in an upgrade slot.

By existing it enforces permissions on the usage of the system.%n%nThe security system does not prevent destructive tampering, removing cables / machines or breaking of drives. If you need to protect your system from physical vandalism you will need another form of physical security. This block provides network level security.%n%nThe player who places the ME security terminal has full control over the network and cannot exclude himself any rights. By adding a blank biometric card you define a default behavior for every player who has no biometric card registered.%n%nIn addition to security on the software layer, you can link up your wireless terminal with the network and access it wirelessly.%n%nIf you have one on your main network, your subnets may also need one to have access to your main network, but this is not always the case depending on how you set it up.%n%n%nThe ME Wireless Access Point wireless access via a wireless terminal. Range and power usage is determined based on the number of wireless boosters installed into the ME wireless access point.

# Quest: Interfacing with Machines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFFg.name=Interfacing with Machines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFFg.desc=The ME Interface is the only component which can be used as a part, or as a Block. Crafting an ME interface in either form by itself produces the other form. The thin form is useful if you want to provide several different interfaces in a single block of physical space, but each will need its own channel. The block form lets multiple other blocks connect to a single ME interface, using only one channel for the interface. The ME Interface acts as an in between when working with pipes, tubes, networks, or machines from other mods.%n%n§3If you're using a resource pack and the interface's GUI doesn't show up properly, you'll need to delete the assets\appliedenergistics2\textures\guis\interface.png file in your resourcepack zip file.

# Quest: Interfacing with Inventories
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFFw.name=Interfacing with Inventories
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFFw.desc=The ME storage bus, when attached to another inventory block in the world lets you access that inventory via networked functions. This allows you to use chests, barrels, or other types of item storage in your networks.%n%nThe storage via the ME storage bus is bi-directional, it can both insert, or extract items from the inventory block it is attached to as long as the ME storage bus has its required channel.%n%nThe UI allows you to control which items are selected as storable items, this selection has no effect on what items can be extracted once they are in the storage.%n%nThe storage bus will function with nearly any inventory block, including ME Interfaces, Minefactory Reloaded DSUs, Factorization barrels, JABBA Barrels, and Better Storage crates. They can also be used to route items passively into Buildcraft pipes.%n%nIf you place a storage bus on an ME Interface the storage bus will be able to interact with the full contents of the target network, unless that interface is configured to store items inside itself, in which case it will see those stored items.

# Quest: Interfacing with Tanks

# Quest: Extracting Items From the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFGg.name=Extracting Items From the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFGg.desc=The ME export bus extracts items from the ME network's networked storage and places them into the inventory it faces. You must configure which items it will insert, leaving the configuration blank will result in nothing. The ME export bus will try to export any of the items on its list skipping over those it cannot fit into the destination. This is the functional opposite of the ME import bus.

# Quest: Inserting Items Into the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFHA.name=Inserting Items Into the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFHA.desc=Pulls items from the inventory it is pointed at and places them into the ME network's networked storage. You can specify which items it will pull out via the UI, else it tries to pull out any item in the adjacent inventory. The ME import bus will attempt to import any possible options, even if 1 or more of the configured items cannot be stored. This is the functional opposite of the ME export bus.%n%nWhen your machines are very fast, it's better to have them output directly into an ME interface instead, since that works instantly.

# Quest: 1k Crafting Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFIw.name=1k Crafting Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFIw.desc=Component of the crafting CPU which provides 1024 bytes of storage for crafting. The Crafting Storage blocks are the only necessary part. Each crafting CPU multiblock allows for a separate crafting job (this is different from sub-tasks of the same job). The more items in the recipe and sub-recipes, the more crafting storage you'll need. Having one big and a couple small might be a good idea, but remember it will try to use the best one available first when you order a craft. They are also used when a crafting card requests a craft, so you'll need several separate ones if you intend to use those a lot. A crafting CPU multiblock uses only one channel, regardless of it's size. It must be square to form.

# Quest: 4k Item Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFJA.name=4k Item Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFJA.desc=Second tier storage cell, which can contain 4,096 bytes of storage. 4,096 bytes of storage can hold 508 stacks of a single item, or 260 stacks, while holding 63 different items.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMA.desc=A specialized version of the ME crafting terminal designed to encode blank patterns into encoded patterns.%n%nLets you browse the contents of your network like other terminals, but also contains an area for designing patterns. There are two modes for pattern encoding. Crafting patterns, and processing patterns. Processing patterns are designed for use with machines that do not use standard crafting recipes - such as furnaces, or other machines. To select between modes, click the button to the right of the interface: when it shows a standard crafting table, it will create crafting patterns, and when it shows a furnace, it will create processing patterns.%n%nFor crafting patterns ("Crafts..."), you specify the input crafting materials on a standard 3x3 crafting grid, and the output materials are determined automatically.%n%nFor processing patterns ("Creates..."), you specify the input materials and output materials, including quantity, by placing stacks of items in the interface. If a processing operation is not guaranteed to succeed (such as secondary products from some machines), it will not work correctly as a processing pattern.%n%nWhen designing crafting patterns you can click the output to extract a crafted item as long as you have the materials required to craft the item.%nDon't forget to enable oredict substitution where needed.

# Quest: ME in Your Cleanroom
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMQ.name=ME in Your Cleanroom
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMQ.desc=Wireless Connectors are a close range Quantum Network Bridge alternative.%nConnections are point-to-point - you can't connect more than 2 blocks together. Each block will use 10 + distance * ln(distance^2 + 3) AE/t. Does not work across dimensions. Power needs to be provided on only one side. Up to 32 channels can be transferred through the connection. Can connect directly to dense cables. The Wireless Connector itself does not use any channels.

# Quest: Ore Dictionary Output
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMg.name=Ore Dictionary Output
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMg.desc=The ME ore dictionary export card will attempt to push the configured item/fluid [From the same ore dictionary] from the ME network into a machine or other input inventory. To configure an item/liquid, type in the item's name [e.g. if you want to export all ores put "ore*"]. The rate of export is very fast.%n%n§3PS: Use §6crushed* & !crushedPurified* & !crushedCentrifuged*§3§3 to get any crushed ore, but not ore that has been washed, then crushed (to get purified) or run through the thermal centrifuge.§r%n%nThe card can be used in more devices, and causes less lag, but works in a similar way. Put it inside a bus and set the filter using the T looking button that appears. The standalone bus is no longer craftable.

# Quest: To Link P2P Busses
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMw.name=To Link P2P Busses
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFMw.desc=A small item that can be used to store, copy, and paste settings. Shift + right click on a configurable object to save the settings onto the memory card, then right click on any other block of the same type to paste the settings. Shift + right click on a non-configurable object (or the air) to clear. They are also used to link the input P2P tunnel to the corresponding output P2P tunnels. They can also link Vis Relays to compatible devices.

# Quest: Smart cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIRw.name=Smart cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIRw.desc=Smart cables are better than glass or covered cables because you can visually see many channels are in use.

# Quest: Dense cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAISA.name=Dense cables
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAISA.desc=Dense cables are going to be your network backbones. They can transfer 32 channels and display the number of channels in use. Busses and flat interfaces cannot be placed directly on them.

# Quest: Energy Acceptor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIWA.name=Energy Acceptor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIWA.desc=The Energy Acceptor is an alternative place to inject energy into your AE2 network. You can form a "dumb" network with just an EA, but for real capability, you'll want a Controller.%n%n§3If you're making a subnet, just transfer power over with a Quartz Fiber.

# Quest: ME Controller
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIWQ.name=ME Controller
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIWQ.desc=The heart of your ME network. You can inject energy into here as well to power your network, but you probably want to save all available spaces for networking. Without this, you're limited to 8 channels.%n%nThis is a multiblock, and can be expanded up to 7x7x7, and can have 2 adjacent blocks in at most 1 axis, or it will be disabled. Whatever that means, just try it out, ok? You can only have one per network.%n%nAbout channels:%nGenerally, every device uses a channel unless specified otherwise. If you don't have enough, that device will not function. If you can't determine what's causing your network problems, try looking at the lines on the smart and dense cables, or use a network visualizer.

If you fill it with 12 different types of essentia, you can have about 168 units of each. If you want one for every type of essentia, you'll need 67 of them. You'll want to make the essentia terminal to see what you have. They consume the same amount of AE as the item ones.

# Quest: 4k Essentia Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJxg.name=4k Essentia Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJxg.desc=These hold 8,192 units of essentia.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJyQ.desc=The main processor for 2^3, 16^3, and 128^3 spacial storage cells.%n%nHave you ever wanted to pack up and move your entire base, but thought it was too much of a pain? Wish you could just teleport the whole thing? Well now you, uh, still can't, because GT blocks DO NOT PLAY WELL with being teleported by AE spatial stuff. Like, world corruption level bad. But you could make a teleporter I guess?

# Quest: AE Spatial Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJyg.name=AE Spatial Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJyg.desc=The main part of 2^3 spatial cells.

# Quest: AE Spatial Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJyw.name=AE Spatial Storage

# Quest: AE Spatial Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJzQ.name=AE Spatial Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJzQ.desc=Contains up to a 2^3 area inside it. This is 8 blocks, so if you just want to teleport yourself, you don't need to make the later ones.

# Quest: AE Spatial Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJzg.name=AE Spatial Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJzg.desc=Contains up to a 16^3 area inside it. This is 4096 blocks.

# Quest: AE Spatial Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJzw.name=AE Spatial Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJzw.desc=Contains up to a 128^3 area inside it. This is 2,097,152 blocks. Teleport a village to the Moon to make them suffer!

# Quest: Exporting Essentia From the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0Q.name=Exporting Essentia From the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0Q.desc=Does exactly what it says. But you probably won't need it much, if at all.

# Quest: Pulling Essentia Into the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0g.name=Pulling Essentia Into the Network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0g.desc=Attach to either Alembics or the output of the Advanced Alchemical Furnace. If that doesn't work, have them pipe to a jar and import from there. You can finally get rid of your shifty-eyed golems.

# Quest: Centi-vis in your network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0w.name=Centi-vis in your network
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ0w.desc=You can use this device to either transfer the contents (CV) of a Vis Relay to another vis relay, an Arcane Assembler, or an Arcane Crafting Terminal. Either way, place the relay on the device (and send some CV to it), and use the memory card to link to the second device. If you send it to another Vis Relay Interface, you'll obviously need another Vis Relay on the other side.

# Quest: Storing Essentia in Jars? Why, again?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1A.name=Storing Essentia in Jars? Why, again?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1A.desc=So apparently you can attach this to a void/oblivion jar and have it void overflow if you set the priority low. Neat, huh?%n%nWhat? Store essentia in jars? Seriously? I guess you could, if you really wanted to, or if there were new, larger jars...

# Quest: Magic Terminals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1Q.name=Magic Terminals
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1Q.desc=The Arcane Crafting Terminal is the terminal version on the Arcane Workbench. It can hold a set of vis discount gear in it's inventory in addition to a wand.

# Quest: The Fluid Terminal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1g.name=The Fluid Terminal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1g.desc=The ME Fluid Terminal allows you to directly input and output fluids from the network using buckets, cells, and other fluid-containing items. Put a filled cell (or other item) in the bottom left to have the contents deposited into the network, and the cell moved to the output slot. For the reverse, select a fluid and insert an empty cell, and it'll fill it.

# Quest: Illuminated Panels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1w.name=Illuminated Panels
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ1w.desc=All terminals are made from these. You'll probably want several.

# Quest: Easier AL automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2A.name=Easier AL automation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2A.desc=Unlike regular pattern terminals, the processing pattern terminal doesn't have a crafting mode. Instead, you have a lot more slots for input and output, and the ability to swap them. Great for your Assembling Line patterns. Why not directly make the fluid option? It is a straight upgrade.

# Quest: Making Patterns Quick
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2Q.name=Making Patterns Quick
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2Q.desc=The Pattern Encoder will allow you to use NEIs shift-click ? button functionality to create a crafting pattern even if you don't have the appropriate items.%n%nHowever, you can also drag the items from NEI to do the same thing, though much slower, because you have to look up each component. This is vastly less useful for processing patterns, since it's always 64 items though.

# Quest: Visualizing How Much Your Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2g.name=Visualizing How Much Your Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2g.desc=The ME Storage Monitor allows you to visualize how much of an item you have. For example you can tell if you're running low on circuits and should make more, or how a long crafting process is proceeding. There are a couple of ways to use them.%n%nRightclick with item: Will display the current level of that item if not locked.%nRightclick with empty hand: Will reset the display if not locked.%nRightclick with AE2 wrench or network tool: Will toggle the lock.%n%n%nThe ME Conversion Monitor is the upgraded version of the ME Storage Monitor. It adds the ability to directly withdraw from or store items into the ME Network. It has the normal interactions, plus more.%n%nShift-right-clicking with item: Attempts to insert the item stack into the network. This works even if it's not the displayed item!%nShift-double-right-clicking: Attempts to insert all item stacks of the type displayed into the network.%nRight-clicking (while locked): Attempts to pull out a stack of the item displayed.

# Quest: Redstone Based on Storage Level
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2w.name=Redstone Based on Storage Level
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ2w.desc=This device will turn on (or off) a redstone signal based on how much of an item you specify (or energy in the network if you select the mode) you have in your network. Left click an item into the space between the 1000 numbers to add, click again while holding nothing to remove.

# Quest: Why Do I Need to Know How Much Manure Slurry I Have?

# Quest: Out of Polytetrafluoroethylene? Turn on the LCR!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3Q.name=Out of Polytetrafluoroethylene? Turn on the LCR!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3Q.desc=It's basically the same as a fluid detector cover, except it detects based on what's in your network. Click a cell into the center to specify, and an empty hand to clear.

# Quest: Essentia Level Emitter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3g.name=Essentia Level Emitter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3g.desc=Same as the other two, but for essentia.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3w.name=Was I Out of Nebrisum, or Was it Terminus?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ3w.desc=These are the essentia versions.

# Quest: Beam Me Up, Scotty
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4Q.name=Beam Me Up, Scotty
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4Q.desc=If you want to teleport stuff around using these, you'll need a drive in the SIOP, and at least 6 pylons hooked up. The pylons need to indicate the X, Y and Z dimensions, with you needing 1 more than you would think. If the efficiency goes below 100%%, the AE cost will balloon enormously, so add more pylons to counteract that. After using a redstone signal to activate the SIOP, the blocks will be moved to the spatial IO dim, and the drive will move to the output, so you can send it somewhere else. This is very important to do properly if you want to use it as a teleporter. Otherwise you can get stuck there. Your network will need to be able to hold all the power needed to teleport at once, so you'll need at least one energy cell. You can only have one Pylon setup per controller, so consider putting them on a subnetwork.%n%nUsing 2 in the X and Z dimensions and 3 in the Y will give you a 1x2x1 teleporter to teleport yourself. You'll want a SIOP port on each side for sending and for receiving. But you'll still need to design a redstone contraption to activate them properly!  %n%nRead this if you want to know more about spatial IO in general, and larger setups: §9§n[url]https://old.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/3c2b2r/a_treatise_on_nocheat_smp_ae2_spatial_io/[/url]§r%nAlso see this if you want to see a fancy teleporter: §9§n[url]https://old.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/2mhrf8/ae2_spatial_transporters/[/url]§r%n%n§4Spatial cells, once used, will only work in the XYZ dimensions first used, with no way to format or recraft. Test in creative first!%n%nExpect your world to lag for a second after using, blame AE.

# Quest: Spring Cleaning
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4g.name=Spring Cleaning
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4g.desc=So, when you first started AE, maybe you dumped a bunch of your items into 1k drives, but now you want to clean them up, or empty them to reuse them in making higher tier ones. The ME IO Port will allow you to fill or empty your drives by connecting to the rest of the network.%n%nYou can use the Cell Workbench to format your drives, so they'll only contain the stuff you want. Remember, more item types mean less space overall. You can set them to lapis for example, then put them in the ME IO Port with the transfer direction to the drive to fill it with only that item. Don't put in an unformatted drive while using storage drawers to store tons of stuff! If you want to move your stuff around, put in new drives, then empty old ones, or disconnect your storage drawers temporarily.%n%nYou can use the Workbench to format fluid drives too, and even use cells instead of buckets.%n%nCell Workbenches do not connect to the network, so they don't need a channel.

# Quest: Formatting Gas-er, Essentia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4w.name=Formatting Gas-er, Essentia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4w.desc=This is the essentia version.

# Quest: Alpha and Omega
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ5A.name=Alpha and Omega
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ5A.desc=The ME Annihilation Plane destroys blocks as if you had mined them, and places them into the network. The Identity version acts as if silk touch was used.%n%nThe ME Formation Plane does the opposite, it places blocks into the world. You'll need to tell it what to place/drop though. This can work in both block and item mode.

# Quest: Moar Patterns!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ5g.name=Moar Patterns!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ5g.desc=You may have noticed that the ME Interface's GUI is different that before. That is because with this card you can have more patterns, adding 9 more per card up to a total of 36. HOWEVER, it also uses 4 times the energy for every item when crafting, and this is multiplicative for each new card. If doing large crafts, make sure you have some dense energy cells ready.%n%nSo basically: (sum of amounts of items in the pattern) * config multiplier (which is 10 for GTNH). with cards, it's also multiplied by 4^(number of upgrades)%n%nE.g: (wood log -> planks) in the interface w/o upgrades would draw: 1*10 AE units, which is 5 EU (remember 1 EU = 2 AE)%n(9 charcoal -> charcoal block) compressor recipe in the interface with 3 upgrades will draw 9*10*4^3*0.5 = 2070 EU, but only 45EU without any cards%n%nThey're kind of expensive, so consider holding off if you can't afford the material or EU costs. If you remove it, all the extra patterns will pop out, so be careful of that when moving your stuff.

# Quest: Singular Singularities Signify Something
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ5w.name=Singular Singularities Signify Something
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ5w.desc=Quest names are hard sometimes, ok? To make a Singularity (for the Quantum Network Bridge), you'll need to dump 512,000 items into the Matter Condenser set to Singularity Mode, while using a 64k component or higher.%n%nThen put the Singularity and Enderpearl Dust on the ground and use an explosion (Tiny TNT works well) to create two Quantum Entangled Singularities.%n%nQESs are each a unique pair.

# Quest: Quantum Bridging Your Outposts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6A.name=Quantum Bridging Your Outposts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6A.desc=A Quantum Network Bridge allows you to connect faraway places to your main AE network, even in other dimensions. So you can shove that pollution producing Mega EBF in the Void where it belongs, but still use it from the safety of your main base. To create this, you'll need a Quantum Link Chamber surrounded by Quantum Rings. Then put an Quantum Entangled Singularity in the link chamber, and connect to one of the 4 Quantum Rings around it with a fluix cable. They cost 1000EU/t for each pair.%n%nYou can power the other side from the first, but you need to jumpstart it first, so bring an energy cell when setting it up. Remember that it's part of the same network, so you can only have one controller, and you're still limited by the channels of the cable you connected with, so you may wish to use the P2P Tunnel to bring more across.%n%nIf you use several, you may wish to rename the QESs.

# Quest: Tools of the Trade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6Q.name=Tools of the Trade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6Q.desc=The Network Tool is AE2's main utility tool.%n%nRight-click on a network to see the power usage, and what makes up the network.%nRight-click on air to interact with it's inventory to store cards or turn facades transparent.%nShift-right-click to remove fixtures (import bus, interface, etc) that don't take up a full block without removing the cable, or remove any AE block immediately the same way.%n%nThe Network Visualizer does exactly what it says, it allows you to visualize the channels of your network. First, right-click a network to select it. At first you'll see everything, but you can change the modes by holding shift and scrolling the mouse wheel up or down to see different things. Remember that if you have a subnetwork, like one that P2P tunnels go through for example, those nodes won't show up since it's a different network, but the P2P tunnels entrances and exits will. This goes through solid objects, so you can look at your whole base.

# Quest: Portable Digital Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6g.name=Portable Digital Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6g.desc=They're exactly what they sound like. %n%nThe first is for items and acts like a terminal. It can hold 4,032 of a single item.%n%nThe second is for liquids, and acts like the fluid terminal. It can hold 128 buckets of a single liquid.%n%nIt costs AE to put things in, take them out, or have the interface open. Use the Wireless Charger from EIO if you don't want it to take forever.

# Quest: Deck of Cards
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6w.name=Deck of Cards
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ6w.desc=These cards add additional functionality to certain devices or fixtures. They specify what devices they work on in the tooltip.%n%nThe Redstone Card adds redstone interactivity to the devices it can be used on, with the following options:%nAlways active, active with or without redstone signal, activate once per pulse.%n%nThe Capacity Card adds more slots for items that use them. If you add this to an Export Bus, an icon is added to select item priority.%n%nThe Crafting Card allows you to automatically request autocrafting of items.%nIn an ME Interface, if you put in items to be stocked, if there aren't enough, it'll craft them until it reaches the selected amount. Remember that these are being stocked for crafting recipes that the ME Interface has. If you want them to be seen by the network, you'll need to put a storage bus on the ME Interface.%n%nIn an ME Level Emitter, in the first mode, it'll emit a redstone signal while the specific item is being crafted. In the second, it will emit a redstone signal once a crafting job for the item has been requested, but§4§r §4it won't send the items to be crafted.§r This is useful if you're using a dummy pattern, and are using the level emitter to tell something else to happen. You still need to get the item(s) requested back into the system so it doesn't tie up a crafting CPU though.%n%nIn an ME Export Bus, it'll attempt to send whatever item(s) are selected in the export bus' GUI. In the first mode, it'll send available items first, then create crafting jobs for the rest. In the second mode, it will only send crafted items.%n%nThe Acceleration Card makes the device/fixture work faster. You'll probably want a lot of these.%n%nThe Inverter Card allows you to invert the item filter of certain fixtures.%n%nThe Fuzzy Card allows you to apply fuzzy logic to filtering to allow items with different NBT or damage data to be counted as the same. This is different from metadata. If you just want it to be fuzzy for nbt, set to Match Any. If it is set to 99%%, it will work on anything that is damaged. You can use the Inverter Card to reverse this.

# Quest: Fluids of the Trade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ7A.name=Fluids of the Trade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ7A.desc=The ME Fluid Auto Filler will add crafting recipes for any fluid in your network that has a bucket version. When crafting a water bucket for example, it will send a bucket to it, and the filled water bucket back.

# Quest: Wireless 2.0
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ7g.name=Wireless 2.0
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ7g.desc=This is the good wireless terminal. It even has crafting. There's a bit of lag when you open it, but the convenience it worth it, right? You can't pull out fluids, but you can hold on to the universal one if you want.%n%nThe Magnet Card does not pull items to you. Instead, it allows you to automatically deposit them into the network. You can right-click to change the white/blacklist, or shift-right-click to change the mode.

# Quest: Cut the Power!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8A.name=Cut the Power!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8A.desc=The ME Toggle Bus allows you to cut off access through a cable if it doesn't receive a redstone signal. The inverted version is, well, inverted. It must be placed between the cables, like a Quartz Fiber.

# Quest: Providing Essentia on Demand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8Q.name=Providing Essentia on Demand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8Q.desc=The Essentia and Infusion Providers both do basically the same thing, send essentia to a device that requests it for crafting.%n%nThe Essentia Provider needs to be next to the device, it's mostly for the Thaumatorium. Since it's effectively a magic ME Interface, you can also use it instead of an Essentia Import Bus next to your Alembics or the Advanced Alchemical Furnace.%n%nThe Infusion Provider is for devices that draw essentia through the air, like the Runic Matrix (infusion) or Overchanting Table. It doesn't need to be next to the device.%n%nThey both obviously need the essentia they request to be accessible by the network to work.

# Quest: Ordering Essentia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8g.name=Ordering Essentia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8g.desc=The Distillation Pattern Encoder allows you to automatically melt down items in your alchemical furnace to provide essentia.%nFirst, place something that is already scanned in the device, along with a blank pattern. You can create the pattern by clicking the button, or click the different aspects to select one that is not the highest. This will create a pattern of item -> essentia. Then use an ME Interface pointing at a furnace with the pattern in it. You can now craft that type of essentia the same way you would a normal craft, but through the Essentia Terminal.%n%n§4There isn't a way to have the system craft essentia on demand for a craft unfortunately.§r%n%n

# Quest: Autocrafting Magic Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8w.name=Autocrafting Magic Stuff
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ8w.desc=The Arcane Assembler works like a combination of the Molecular Assembler and the Arcane Workbench, allowing you to autocraft anything crafted in the latter. You need to link a vis relay through the network to supply essentia to it, and a Knowledge Core with recipes on it for to work. Additionally, you can add vis discount gear into the interface to take advantage of the discount. The base discount starts at 20%%. For each Acceleration card, the time taken will reduce by 20%%, and increase power used by 50%%. For every point of warp on the discount gear, the power costs increase by 15%%.%n%nThe knowledge core holds up to 21 patterns for use in the Arcane Assembler, but you need a new assembler for every knowledge core if you want to autocraft more than that.%n%nTo encode the patterns, you need a Knowledge Inscriber. It works exactly as you would expect. It doesn't connect to the network, so it doesn't need a channel. If you want to erase a pattern select it and the save icon should become erase instead.%n

# Quest: Miscellaneous AE Items
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ9A.name=Miscellaneous AE Items
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ9A.desc=There are several AE items that aren't particularly useful, but probably deserve mention, so here they are:%n%nCertus Tanks: They hold 32B and are portable and easy to make.%n%nView Cell: Format in a Cell Workbench to filter what you see in a terminal (when they're installed in it)%n%nCertus/Nether Quartz Cutting Knifes: Right-click to open interface. Place an iron ingot in the slot, and choose a name. The press can be used in the Inscriber to name stuff without using an anvil. You can also rename p2p tunnels and interfaces in world with the knife.%n%nME Block Container: Holds only one type of item, but the amount of a 64k drive. Can place the item in world, or replace in a 1x1 or 3x3 area. Blocks replaced will be dumped in world. This will be horizontal or vertical depending on which side of a block you select. Shift-right click air to change mode, right click a block to activate mode.%n%nCharged Quartz Fixture: Emits light at the same level as a torch, but fancier.%n%nLight Detecting Fixture: Emits redstone signal based on light. Since it only starts at 7, it's not as useful as the Light Sensor.%n%nME Upgrade (Tier 1/2/3): If you're an OC person, there's 3 upgrades you can make to add access to your network from robots and drones.%nT1: 0.5 access point range%nT2: Normal access point range%nT3: Unlimited range, any dim%n%nEntropy Manipulator: Changes grass/dirt/dried dirt into each other, or starts fires. Or melts ice. Useless.%n%nMatter Cannon: Shoots Matter Balls made in the Matter Condensor. Put it in an ME Chest or Drive and put items in a Terminal to fill. Decent I guess? But it destroys blocks every time you use it, so... Well, I guess you could use it with Paint Balls?%n%nColor Applicator: Use dye items or Paint Balls (more efficient) to dye stuff. You can dye cables, or anything Forge-compatible, like wool or glass. Place items inside like the Matter Cannon. You can cycle through the colors by holding shift and right-clicking, or scrolling the mouse wheel. If you use snow balls, you can remove paint instead. You can also use it in a dispensor.%n%nWalrus: It's a walrus, what were you expecting?

# Quest: Magical Minions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ9Q.name=Magical Minions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ9Q.desc=You can use the Wireless Golem Backpack to connect your golem to the network if it's close enough to an access point. See the Thaumonomicon for details.%n%n

# Quest: Short Guide - A Basic AE2 System
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKwQ.name=Short Guide - A Basic AE2 System
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKwQ.desc=So you've unlocked AE2, but don't know how to use it? Not to worry, that's what this questline is for. For a basic (and not completely useless) ME system, make the items on the right first. After you go through the quests to get them normally of course.%n%n§3You could technically make one with an ME Chest, but there'd be no advantage over using a regular chest.§r%n%nConnect power to the Energy Acceptor, place the ME Drive next to it, place a Fluix Cable on top of the ME Drive connect the ME Terminal to the cable. Just put in the Storage cells, and you're done! Remember you need a Network Tool to see how much power it actually uses. Also, it lets you pick up stuff easier.%n%nTo save power, let's do a little extra work. Place the Pressure Plate two spaces in front of the ME Terminal, place redstone next to it and beside the Energy Acceptor. Remove the EA and place a Fluix Cable there, and then place the ME Toggle Bus between the Drive and where the Energy Acceptor will be. Then plunk that back down and re-power it. This will cause it to only connect (and thus use power) when you stand on the plate. This tiny network uses about 38 EU by itself, so you should understand that an ME system is not cheap either in materials or power.%n%nYou should make either 1k or 4k storage cells to put into your ME Drive.

# Quest: Short Guide - External Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKwg.name=Short Guide - External Storage
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKwg.desc=Drawers are great, right? Well, let's connect your ME system to a bank of them. Set up some drawers nearby with a controller attached. Then place an ME Storage Bus against the controller and set the priority to +1. This will prioritize I/O to the drawer controller. Lock your drawers before they fill with random stuff. Now you have access to the whole thing! Great for the results of mining, and anything else you have thousands of, while keeping your ME system relatively empty.%n%nYou can also connect to chests and other things if you want. You can use an Ender Chest to send stuff into your network, which will then send it to the drawers, but you'll have stuff entering and exiting constantly, so it'll mess up your view in the Terminal. You can use filtered view cells, or process them before they go into your ME network (or in a different one) and/or send them to the DC directly via another EC. It depends on what you want to do and what it is.%n%n§4Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will tank TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.

# Quest: Short Guide - Autocrafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKww.name=Short Guide - Autocrafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKww.desc=This is the main purpose of AE2, so let's get to it. Plunk down the Crafting Storage and Molecular Assembler, connect the Pattern Terminal to a cable, and attach the ME Interface to the MA (make sure it has power from another side). You could run it without a ME Interface, but you can only do one recipe then. Place a Blank Pattern in the Pattern Terminal, and add the recipe for a Crafting Table, then click the arrow to save it to the pattern. Put this in the ME Interface and you can now request a craft of it. (if the items are in the network, otherwise it'll fail obviously)%n%nFor processing patterns (machines, anything not regular 3x3 crafting) click the button on the right. You'll need to specify all I/O for it yourself. You can use this on an ME Interface on a furnace (for example), combined with an ME Import Bus to collect the results. If it's a machine that auto-ejects (like multis) you can use a ME Interface to collect the results much faster (and with less lag).

# Quest: Short Guide - P2P
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKxA.name=Short Guide - P2P
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKxA.desc=One of the more complicated parts of AE2, you'll need to understand this to really get anywhere with the mod. First, replace your EA with an ME Controller. Now you have a bunch more channels to work with. Place the P2P Bus against one of the sides and then connect some cables to it to a place a bit away. Make sure to send power to this cable with an EA or Quartz Fiber, but NOT a normal cable, this is now a separate network, and that would cancel that. Connect the second P2P Bus to the other end, and then place at least 1 Dense Cable coming off of it. Shift-right click your 1st P2P Bus, then Right click the 2nd. They're now connected, and there are 2 channels being used on your subnetwork, while you have the full 32 from the side of your Controller to use. For each subnetwork that doesn't have an ME Controller, you can send 4 sides, or 128 channels. I'm sure you can understand how useful this is, right?%n%nThere's lots more to understand about AE2, but you should probably either experiment, read the quests, or watch a video for more than the basics.

# Quest: Applied Greg?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALPQ.name=Applied Greg?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALPQ.desc=ME Buses are combination of technology and...other technology. Don't give me that look, it is, ok? With these, you can now directly I/O items between GregTech multiblock and ME network. They have §osignificantly§r less lag, so please start using them as soon as possible on servers.%n%nYou just pop off your GT bus + ME bus or ME interface combination, and replace both with the new bus and connect a ME cable directly to it. It uses 1 channel, same as the other options.

# Quest: AE2 Fluid Crafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsg.name=AE2 Fluid Crafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsg.desc=Fluid crafting directly integrated in your ME system. NO WAY!%n%nAE2FC is a powerful addon that was backported for GTNH.%n%nNow, what do you need to get that juicy stuff working?%nEvery ME System needs a Fluid Discretizer. It allows for on demand crafting. While you can use AE2FC without Fluid Discretizer for moving fluids, you need a Discretizer for autocrafting.%n%nThen you also need a Fluid Terminal or a Fluid Processing Terminal for the Assembling Line. %n%nWhen creating patterns you will notice your fluids being placed as if they were items. %nYour finished patterns will look blue-ish. Placing those in a Dual Interface will allow AE2 to push the fluids and items both. Note. Fluids are being sent first, then items.%nYou can switch the dual interface on the top right if you want it to keep fluids in stock. %n%nIf you use a blue pattern (fluid pattern) in a normal interface, AE2 will send the fluid as a fluid packet. This is just a representation of the fluid as an item. A fluid decoder can turn it back into a fluid and saves it in the fluid grid.%n%nYou can use an ingredient buffer (large or normal) so your items and fluids sent by a pattern can get stored internally in one block. The normal buffer can hold 9 items and 4 fluids whereas the large one can hold 27 items and 7 fluids. It is not needed, but you can use it to automate things with item and fluid conduits. %n%nIf you want to automate single blocks its as easy as eating chocolate cake while on a diet:%nMake the pattern, make an interface, boom- done! It will automatically insert the fluid in the fluid inventory of a single block machine. %n%nEven automating more difficult things like the Assembling Line becomes much easier with these tools.%n%nIf you need more detailled information, visit the wiki:%n%n§9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/AE2FC[/url]§r%n%n§3The Extra Cells mod has been removed. Any old components and cells were converted to AE2 and AE2FC parts where possible.

# Quest: 16384k Fluid Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.MJoHkNK0Ta-zKyJAvV_DBg.name=16384k Fluid Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.MJoHkNK0Ta-zKyJAvV_DBg.desc=It holds over 32GL.

# Quest: Another Digital Singularity
betterquesting.quest.QF-_KNlHSnObOPmrJptkwQ.name=Another Digital Singularity
betterquesting.quest.QF-_KNlHSnObOPmrJptkwQ.desc=You've probbaly drained quite a few of them at this point%n%n§3Have you heard about YOTTanks?


## Quest Line: How to Be(e)
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFA.name=How to Be(e)
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFA.desc=A non-tiered quest set that is meant as an in game, quest based tutorial and guide to bees. Since they are a really helpful tool to advance forward.

# Quest: First Things First
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB9A.name=First Things First
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB9A.desc=As usual. In order to get started with bees, you need a few basic things. Most importantly... a scoop. For this quest you want to make a GregTech scoop. Later you can make scoops using magic or even rechargeable scoops.

# Quest: Go Find Some Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB9Q.name=Go Find Some Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB9Q.desc=The next thing to do: Find a few bee hives around the world. There are 11 mundane bees that can be found, of which 8 are located in the Overworld. Any kind of bee will work for this quest.

# Quest: A New Home
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB9g.name=A New Home
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB9g.desc=Now that you've destroyed the poor bees' homes, you should build them a new one. The humble Bee House will not let your bees mutate into new species. But you'll need the combs anyways for better housing. The production rate isn't too bad, but they cannot be automated.%n%nOne tip - Put some vanilla saplings near the Bee Houses. Bee Houses give a natural boost of 3x to pollination vs better housing. The bees will pollinate them and you might get lucky and start getting some Forestry tree crossbreeding. Stick with Oak and Birch trees, they'll give you a nice mix of starter Forestry trees.%n%nOf course, if you do this without taking precautions, you may find yourself swarmed by laggy butterflies...%n%nYou may also notice that bees with the 'flower' type flower spread flowers. This can be used to get, say, lavender, among others. If you don't like them spreading them everywhere, replace the dirt/grass blocks, remove the trait, or reduce the pollination speed/territory.

# Quest: Analyze Them All
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB9w.name=Analyze Them All
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB9w.desc=Every bee has multiple properties that define what the bee does, how it behaves in rain or at night, and a couple of other aspects. It is mandatory to keep track of those properties. This kit isn't very good since it doesn't give you information on their Inactive attributes, but waste not, want not.%n%nYou'll need to use paper to analyze each bee.

# Quest: To Scan or Not to Scan
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-A.name=To Scan or Not to Scan
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-A.desc=In order to get into bee breeding, you need a way to see all the traits, active and inactive. You only want to breed so called "pure" bees; For those, both "Active" and "Inactive" traits are identical.%n%n§3BTW, it's not like the more 'advanced' versions are actually better, just that they have more functions. Use the one you like.

# Quest: Top-Tier Analyser
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-Q.name=Top-Tier Analyser
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-Q.desc=The best you can get, for all your scanning and analysing needs.

# Quest: To Play God
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-g.name=To Play God
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-g.desc=In order to continue with bees, to mutate and breed them as you like, you need mutagen. This greenish, smelly liquid needs to be refined from bacterial sludge that seems to be available only on Mars. You will be able to continue, once you've arrived there.%n%nIn the meantime you can start working with the Genetics mod, since we all know Gendustry is too easy... Check out the recipes and you'll understand why you should look into the Genetics mod.%n%n§3Make sure to make more with the Vat once you can actually make it.

# Quest: Upgraded Home
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-w.name=Upgraded Home
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB-w.desc=The Bee House can be used to stabilize mutations, for example if you have successfully bred two different bees, but the passive traits are different from the active ones. %n%nTo actually breed those together to get a new species, you'll need something different - the Apiary. Building them will require a Carpenter and Impregnated frames, along with Seed Oil and Creosote - quite a bit of industrialization! Or, if you're lucky, you can find a beekeeper villager to trade with. Maybe you can help the villagers §lget lucky§r to make more beekeeper villagers? If only Cupid and his bow were around...%n%nProduction rates in an empty Apiary are low - lower than a Bee House by quite a bit, in fact.  But the Apiary has two big advantages - Frames, and Automation. You can now use your Untreated or Impregnated frames in here to boost output - and the boost is multiplied. So 3 x2 frames gives you 2 * 2 * 2 = 8x extra output! You can also automate I/O for the bees and their products, though not frames unfortunately.%n%nBees also don't live as long as in a Bee House, but that's actually a good thing.%n%nAlso, you should check the Genetics mod for useful machines. The Acclimatiser can give very picky bees a much wider temperature or humidity tolerance without having to breed it into them.

# Quest: Mutatron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_A.name=Mutatron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_A.desc=Mutations can be boring, they can be annoying, and most times, they are frustrating. With this machine, you will get a 100 percent pure bred mutation. If the combination of princess and drone can result in multiple mutations, the outcome is random. But who cares?%n%n§3You can now upgrade your leftover Bees Advanced bags to Bees Expert in the last quest tab.%n%nIf you missed grabbing an effect from a species, this is a way to get it again.%n%nYou'll need naquadah bees to make this, and the other Gendustry machines.

# Quest: Genetic Sampler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_Q.name=Genetic Sampler
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_Q.desc=With this machine, you can extract a random trait from any bee, sapling, butterfly or flower. The bee/sapling/butterfly/flower will be destroyed in this process. Each process requires an empty gene sample and some labware.%n%nThe resulting sample is random, so make sure to recycle the extra gene samples you don't want.

# Quest: Diamondware
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_g.name=Diamondware
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_g.desc=Also known as labware. Be prepared. In order to do serious bee-work, you need stacks of diamonds. I'm not joking, stacks! Better start working on that diamond bee!

# Quest: Genetic Imprinter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_w.name=Genetic Imprinter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB_w.desc=With this powerful machine, you can inject gene samples, which allows you to alter any aspect of your bee, tree or butterfly. The gene sample (or pattern) will not be destroyed. The success rate is 100%%, and one labware is consumed per injection.

# Quest: Genetic Transposer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAA.name=Genetic Transposer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAA.desc=DNA samples of species and/or traits are pretty valuable. You always should keep at least one of each gene sample you get your hand on in a chest somewhere safe. By using this machine, you are able to copy any gene sample, for the cost of an empty serum vial and some labware.%n%n§3You don't actually need to keep all of them if you don't intend to use them of course.

# Quest: Advanced Mutatron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAQ.name=Advanced Mutatron
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAQ.desc=A more advanced version of the mutatron. It uses more energy to mutate a drone with a princess, and you can select which mutation you want to have. This machine is a must-have for high-tier bees.%n%n§3You'll need neutronium bees to make this.

# Quest: Blank Gene Samples
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAg.name=Blank Gene Samples
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAg.desc=To get the various traits from a bee, you need a lot of power, labware and an empty gene sample. You don't need a lot of those, as you can just throw them in a furnace to remove remaining DNA of traits you don't need or want. %n%nIn the meantime you can start working with the Genetics mod, since we all know Gendustry is too easy... Genetics is used for bees, trees, and Botany flowers so it gets its own quest tab. Gendustry is really good for bees, but will require top tier equipment.

# Quest: Genetic Template
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAw.name=Genetic Template
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAw.desc=Templates are used to combine multiple gene samples into one large batch. It can be used to apply multiple traits at once, but you can also replicate a bee from liquid DNA and protein, if you manage to fill all 13 traits in one template. These templates can also be copied, just like the small samples.

# Quest: A Rather Cruel Disposal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBA.name=A Rather Cruel Disposal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBA.desc=You'll probably end up with a lot of excess drones while doing bees. (Or saplings if you do trees). Instead of throwing them away, you could also turn them into... something useful.

# Quest: Arnie's Blender
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBQ.name=Arnie's Blender
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBQ.desc=They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. This machine turns raw meat into liquid protein, which is used to create bees from scratch. Which has §oabsolutely§  nothing§r to do with breakfast.

# Quest: And There Shall be Light
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBg.name=And There Shall be Light
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBg.desc=Out of princesses to inject traits to? Too lazy to find hives and get more bees? Not a problem. With this nifty little device, you can use a ton of power, liquid DNA and protein to create any bee you wish to have. The only drawback is: All bees will be ignoble, which means they will die after a random amount of cycles after 90.%n%nOf course, there's an upgrade for the industrial apiary to deal with that

# Quest: Only the Best: Temperature
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBw.name=Only the Best: Temperature
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACBw.desc=On your way to awesome bees, you have to collect only the best traits available.%n%n§3None is for testing jubilant state, while 3 is what you'll have on most of the time. You can hit all temp reqs with 3 if you work in a normal temp area. You can go up to 5 if you use the acclimatizer and want nether bees working in an icy area for some reason.

# Quest: Only the Best: Humidity
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCA.name=Only the Best: Humidity
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCA.desc=On your way to awesome bees, you have to collect only the best traits available.%n%n§3None is for testing jubilant state, while 2 is what you'll have on most of the time. 3+ don't do anything as the range doesn't go that high.

# Quest: Only the Best: Fertility
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCQ.name=Only the Best: Fertility
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCQ.desc=On your way to awesome bees, you have to collect only the best traits available. Bees bees everywhere!%n%n§3F4 is great while breeding bees, but F1 is what you want to use when producing stuff.

# Quest: Highend species: Draconic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCg.name=Highend species: Draconic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCg.desc=On your way to awesome bees, you have to collect only the best traits available.

# Quest: Highend species: Doctoral
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCw.name=Highend species: Doctoral
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCw.desc=On your way to awesome bees, you have to collect only the best traits available.

# Quest: Go Find Some Tropical Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4A.name=Go Find Some Tropical Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4A.desc=Next you'll need to find some tropical bees. The hives can be found in Jungle biomes. Be careful as these bees are very aggressive and can poison you. Collect the silky combs and extract some silk wisp from those in order to make some Apiarist's clothes. Try to get pristine bees. If you're having trouble finding them, you can use Nature's Compass to search for a specific biome.

# Quest: Silky Combs and Propoli
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4Q.name=Silky Combs and Propoli
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4Q.desc=Collect silky combs and extract some silk wisp out of it in order to make some Apiarist's clothes.%n%nThis can take a very long time, so parallelize!%n%nUse a GregTech or Forestry Centrifuge to get Silky Propoli. For higher tier (and useful) combs you need a GT centrifuge.

# Quest: Woven Silk
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4w.name=Woven Silk
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4w.desc=Centrifuge your silky propoli to get some silk wisp at a chance of 60 percent. Put 9 silk wisp in the Forestry carpenter or GregTech assembler to get woven silk. %n%nThis fine fabric can be used for crafting Apiarist's Clothes or to upgrade a Forestry Backpacks to 45 slots.

# Quest: Apiarist's Cloth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD5A.name=Apiarist's Cloth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD5A.desc=If you have collected 24 woven silk you can make a complete Apiarist's suit to be protected from bee stings and other bad bee effects. You can also use the suit parts to upgrade your EnderIO Dark Steel Armor to have the same effect.

# Quest: A Chest for Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEVw.name=A Chest for Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEVw.desc=A chest for bees only. It can hold up to 125 different bees in one chest.

# Quest: Frames
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWA.name=Frames
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWA.desc=Untreated frames are the simplest frames. They do not work in bee houses, only in apiaries or alvearies. You will need them to craft bee houses.%n%nThey increase the bee's performance. Each untreated frame will double a bee's productivity.

# Quest: Impregnated Frames
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWQ.name=Impregnated Frames
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWQ.desc=Impregnated Frames are even better than untreated Frames. %nEach frame doubles the bee's productivity. It has a longer durability than the untreated frame, but a shorter one compared to the proven frame.

# Quest: Production Frames
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWg.name=Production Frames
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWg.desc=You can make proven frames or purchase them from a villager. If you can't find a beekeeper, there are couple of different options to get one. Rescue a zombie villager, add doors to a village to get them to make kids, or perhaps use a cupid's bow and arrow...%n%nAbout magic frames:%nThey're the core of magically endowed frames. They also have a special ability - no maximum production chance. Normal frames are ineffective to get above 16x production (4 frames) but with magic frames you can keep going - just watch out, above 16x you'll be working your bees so hard they have a chance to degenerate into ignoble ones. This can happen any bee tick, not just when they die. Frames to lower genetic decay will lower the chances of this happening.%n%nOf course, with very long lifespans, high production genes, swarmers, and tons of frames, you may think this is worth it.%n%nNote that normal products have a cap of 200%% produced, and specialties 100%%.

# Quest: Alvearies
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEYw.name=Alvearies
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEYw.desc=The alveary is an advanced variant of the apiary. The alveary allows for combs to be produced faster due to its natural speed increase to production (as well as the ability to add up to six frames via the Extra Bees frame housings) and due to its ability to be modified by other blocks. %n%nIt is possible to adjust the internal temperature of the alveary using the alveary heater or alveary fan in order to accommodate bees that require hotter or colder climates.%n%nCertain bees will not produce their specialty items unless they are Jubilant. This requires matching their preferred Temperature/Humidity, without any genetic modifiers. Some bees also need a block of something beneath them as well.%n%nIt is also possible to use mutators to increase chances of mutation, alveary lighting and alveary rain shield to allow bees without the nocturnal and tolerant flyer traits to work during the night and rain, respectively, and the swarmer to use excess royal jelly to create princesses that last for a limited number of generations.%n%n§3If you're mutating bees that need a specific block in it, you need to place the required block under the middle bottom, and have the one directly above be a normal alveary block.

# Quest: Upgrade Your Forestry Backpack
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFVw.name=Upgrade Your Forestry Backpack
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFVw.desc=With your woven silk you can upgrade your Forestry backpacks. Each Pack has 45 slots.%n%nYou need a carpenter, your old backpack and a bit of seed oil.%n%nIf the recipe isn't working, put the bag in a crafting grid to reset its nbt data. After removing anything in it of course.

# Quest: Humid and Warm?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF5w.name=Humid and Warm?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF5w.desc=Stop guessing what the humidity and temperature are for your biome. Use the habitat locator to get a reading on your current climate.

# Quest: Put the Drones in a Jar and Shake it Up
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6A.name=Put the Drones in a Jar and Shake it Up
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6A.desc=Once you get good effects from your bees, instead of just trashing the excess drones, you can put them in collector's jars to get the effects anywhere in your base.%n%nHealing? XP? Poison?%n%nThe collector's jars can even be piped or connected to a conveyor so that drones last a long time.%n%n§3PS: Using the regen effect of Imperial bees while doing Blood Magic may be useful.

# Quest: Death to Bees!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6Q.name=Death to Bees!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6Q.desc=These frames will let you kill your bees faster. It's to breed the next generation sooner, right? Not because you don't like them?

# Quest: Keep Them Around
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6g.name=Keep Them Around
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6g.desc=These frames will keep your bees buzzing for longer. If you care, that is.

# Quest: Are the Bees Buzzing, or Screaming?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6w.name=Are the Bees Buzzing, or Screaming?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF6w.desc=These frames cause mutations at an increased rate. They're super useful.%n%nAbout the stats on frames you see when holding shift, you'll note that some have a different number in brackets next to them, this means that this is the maximum they can be stacked. this only applies to the Extra Bees ones.%n%nThe stats on the frames are also multiplicative instead of additive, so after 4 frames in an alveary, soul frames will max out. On the other hand, accelerated frames will take 9 to get there, but you can just keep on going.%n%nIf you pile up the multipliers, 5x from stimulator, 3x from mutator, and 4x1.8x frames, it'll get you to 157x, getting you those 1%% bees in a single generation!

# Quest: Bees Buzzing Beyond the Dark
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF7A.name=Bees Buzzing Beyond the Dark
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF7A.desc=If even the soul frame takes too long for your taste, the oblivion frame will destroy a bee in a single bee tick (27s). Be careful using more than one, there are rumors it might harm your princesses...%n%n§3You can find them in Stronghold libraries or make them from Dragon Eggs. You can also use a Thaumic Restorer to fix it, and most frames too.

# Quest: Analyser
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHog.name=Analyser
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHog.desc=The Analyzer is a machine that acts in an identical way to the Forestry Analyzer, in that it reveals the genome of bees, trees, butterflies and flowers. It can also be used to reveal the gene present on the DNA Sequence. Unlike the Analyzer, the Analyzer uses power (RF or EU) and DNA Dye to stain chromosomes and determine the genome directly. The analyzer takes 15 seconds to analyse a single individual.%n%nInformation from these quests was taken from Binnie's wiki at §9§n[url]https://binnie.mods.wiki/wiki/Tutorial/Genetics[/url]§r

# Quest: Welcome to Biology Class!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIQ.name=Welcome to Biology Class!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIQ.desc=Binnie's Genetics mod will allow you to pick and chose traits for bees, trees and Botany flowers. But not for free! Doing this comes at a price.%n%nIt's better to provide power to an Ender IO capacitor and then power these machines with RF, instead of powering directly with GT EU, because they don't work well with GT's EU amp system.

# Quest: Making Bees More Comfortable
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIg.name=Making Bees More Comfortable
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIg.desc=The acclimatiser is a key machine for breeding your bees. With lots of power and the appropriate ingredients you can toughen your bees to thrive anywhere. It's recommend to use an EnderIO capacitor to power this device. However, even with climate hardiness your bees still won't produce special items unless they are in their favorite climate. Along with the bee, put in these items to adjust the bee's traits:%n%nSnowball - More cold tolerance%nLava - More heat tolerance%nSand - More dry tolerance%nWater - More wet tolerance%n%nYou should know that the acclimatiser doesn't return capsules or cells. The amount of items needed is pretty random.%n%n§3§3A nice trick is to start with a bee that already has §oboth§r§3. Then you can use either direction to increase it further! You don't need any lava if you do it like this. And no cells either. You can just use sand and snowballs.

# Quest: Incubator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKA.name=Incubator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKA.desc=This is a crafting machine that heats items and liquids to a temperature that encourages bacterial growth. %n%nThe first step of incubation is the creation of Liquid Growth Medium, which is made from incubating Water and Growth Medium. This is subsequently incubated with Wheat to give Bacteria. This solution of bacteria can then be incubated a third time with Sugar to give Enzyme. This is an important compound used in other machines.%n%nThe best way to create enzyme is therefore to chain three incubators together, for each step of the process.

# Quest: Bees By the Millions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKQ.name=Bees By the Millions
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKQ.desc=If you need endgame high speed production, industrial apiaries are the way to go. Industrial Apiaries take upgrade frames that never break. Production frames can be stacked up to 8 high. It also has many options for emulation, more pollen retrieval, and others.%n%nThe Industrial Apiary is now a GT machine. It takes up to UV voltage and up to 4 amps but the base usage is just 37 eu/t. You can no longer use a World Accelerator and there is only the one machine, so no GT overclocking. Instead, there are new §oacceleration upgrades§r that act similar to a World Accelerator but are directly integrated into the machine. You will want to use them, they increase the speed and energy usage by a lot. The final tier also increases productivity.%n%nBut I shouldn't drone on too long. Go make one and find out yourself.

# Quest: Fastest Way to Get There
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKg.name=Fastest Way to Get There
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKg.desc=A GT++ Mutagenic frame will get your bees to their final destination faster than you can blink. Just remember to wear your rubber suit while making it!%n%n§3These will break in the alveary before they take effect since their durability is under 6. So you can only get to 125x, but I think that's enough, don't you?

# Quest: Upgrading the Alveary
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKw.name=Upgrading the Alveary
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIKw.desc=These basic upgrades to the Alveary make it more powerful. %n%nFrame Housing - Automation-enabled frame slot for the Alveary. Uses §55 durability§r every bee tick (27s). If it runs out on that tick, it has no effect.%nAveary Stabilizer - Prevents the bees from mutating into another species. Ideal for breeding traits into a line.%nAlveary Transmission - Power input for upgrades that use power.%nHatchery - Hatches larval bees for use in Genetics or to create additional drones. Not used for Gendustry stuff.%nAlveary Sieve - Instead of the pollen from a bee fertilizing a nearby tree, it is stored here and can be manually applied. Requires manually placing woven silk in the inventory.%nSwarmer - Creates additional Ignoble queens in hives around the Alveary. These are genetic copies of the original. This uses royal jelly or aromatic lumps. The latter are more effective.%n%n§3Note that all upgrade blocks must be in the bottom 2 layers. The center block also cannot be an upgrade block, though the bottom center can.%n%n§4When using power, the transmission block will suck down entire amps to fill a tiny amount. Use the EIO capacitors or something similar to prevent this.

# Quest: Busy Bees Buzzing Boldly
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILA.name=Busy Bees Buzzing Boldly
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILA.desc=These upgrades can significantly increase your production rate by keeping your bees from stopping production due to the environment.%n%nRain Shield - Can work through the rain%nLighting - Can work day and night%nAlveary Heater - Increases temperature a flat 20%% each (needs power)%nAlveary Fan - Decreases temperature a flat 20%% each (needs power)%nAlveary Hygroregulator[sic] - Has two modes, water and lava%nLava - Temp+10%%, Humidity-20%%%nWater - Temp010%%, Humidity+20%%%n%nUnfortunately, there's no way to make them like caves with a block.

# Quest: A Stim a Day Keeps the Doctor Awake
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILQ.name=A Stim a Day Keeps the Doctor Awake
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILQ.desc=Supporting circuit boards that can hold 4 electron tubes, the Electrical Stimulator provides a variety of functions. All numbers are in percent:%n%nIron ET - Production: 150 (Max 500)%nDiamantine ET - Production: 250 (Max 1000)%nApatine ET - Pollination: 150 (Max 500)%nObsidian ET - Lifespan: 80 (Min 20)%nLapis ET - Lifespan: 150 (Max 500)%nBlazing ET - Simulates hellish temperature%nGolden ET - Mutation rate: 150 (Max 500)%nTin ET - Territory: 40 (Min 10) Prod: 90 (Min 50)%nBronze ET - Territory: 150 (Max 500)%n%nGenetic Decay is also increased by 50%% for all of them. This affects how long until ignoble bees die off, so don't worry about it if your bees are pristine.

# Quest: X-Men, or Should I Say X-Bee?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILg.name=X-Men, or Should I Say X-Bee?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILg.desc=The Mutator can vastly accelerate genetic mutations, even allowing those ultra rare bees to be bred. Items inserted into the Mutator control how much mutation it causes.%n%nSoul Sand - 50 percent increase%nEnder Pearl - 100 percent increase%nEye of Ender - 300 percent increase

# Quest: Genepool
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILw.name=Genepool
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAILw.desc=Another important resource is Raw DNA. This can be obtained from any breedable organism such as bees, trees or flowers, and is created in the Genepool. The Genepool requires both Ethanol and Enzyme to digest the DNA, and will destroy the organism. Note this gives raw DNA, and does not preserve any genes or alleles present.

# Quest: Isolator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMA.name=Isolator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMA.desc=The Isolator acts in a similar way to the Genepool, but does not completely destroy genes. It instead allows the isolation of a single gene from an organism, without destroying it. The exact gene is random, and is written into an Blank Sequence. Until the sequence is analysed in an Analyser, it will be unknown what the gene is. It doesn't however need to be analysed before being sent to the Sequencer.

# Quest: Sequencer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMQ.name=Sequencer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMQ.desc=After obtaining a DNA Sequence with the gene that you wish, it must be placed in the Sequencer. This uses Fluorescent Dye to determine the correct sequence, and when completed logs the discovery. The important thing here is that the discovery goes to the person who placed the machine.%n%nGenes are sequenced faster if the sequence has been placed in a Polymeriser first to increase the strength.

# Quest: Polymeriser
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMg.name=Polymeriser
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMg.desc=Serums and sequences can be placed in a Polymeriser to increase their strength and amount of DNA held within. Serums need to be polymerised at least once before being used in the inoculator. To polymerise, both Raw DNA and Polymerising Bacteria are required. Raw DNA is obtained from the Genepool, and Polymerising Bacteria is made from incubating bacteria with bonemeal. Gold nuggets can be used as a catalyst to speed up the process.

# Quest: Gene Database
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMw.name=Gene Database
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIMw.desc=Discovered genes are logged into the Gene Database. This handheld device lists all genes by the type of organism they apply to. To add a gene to an Empty Serum Vial to allow inoculation, the desired gene can be clicked on while holding the vial. An Empty Serum Array can be used to hold more than one gene at once.

# Quest: Lab Stand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINA.name=Lab Stand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINA.desc=The Lab Stand is a block on which an Apiarist Database, Arborist Database, Botanist Database or Gene Database can be placed by right clicking on the placed stand with the database, attaching it and allowing the database to be accessed by right clicking on the stand.

# Quest: Registry
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINg.name=Registry
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINg.desc=The Registry combines the existing four databases into a new sleek browser to allow the properties, mutations and genes of all discovered bees, trees, butterflies and flowers.

# Quest: Inoculator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINw.name=Inoculator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINw.desc=The final step is inoculation. Currently the only machine capable of inserting genes is the Inoculator. This uses Bacteria Vector, created by incubating Bacteria and Blaze Powder, to transfer the gene into organisms.%n%nOnly the young stage of organisms can be injected, which are larvae (bees), pollen (trees and flowers) and caterpillars (butterflies). Bee larvae can be converted into drones by incubating with Liquid Growth Medium.

# Quest: Tools for the Geneticist

# Quest: Master Registry
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI7g.name=Master Registry
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI7g.desc=The master beekeeper needs a master registry. Make sure you don't get any tears in your apiaries as you collect all the requirements!

# Quest: Ghetto Biome Changing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcA.name=Ghetto Biome Changing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcA.desc=If you don't want to change the biome to a specific one, and just want a neutral environment for your bees, maybe using nodes is for you. You can try planting a Silverwood Sapling to get one with a pure node, or use other methods to move one.%n%nKeep in mind a 'bare' pure node won't change anything unless it has Victus. You can try use Sinister or Tainted, but...no refunds. These nodes have a radius of 11. To change the biome back, use an Ethereal Bloom (radius of 7). Keep in mind that both Pech and Wisps spawn in 'Magical' type biomes.

# Quest: IAADDS
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM1A.name=IAADDS
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM1A.desc=Aka the Mega Apiary.%n%nIt has three primary modes (change with screwdriver) and two operation modes (change with shift+screwdriver):%n%nINPUT MODE: Does not take power. Put your queens in the input bus to put them in the internal buffer.%n%nOUTPUT MODE: Does not take power. Will give your bees back to the output bus.%n%nOPERATING MODE - NORMAL: The processing time is 5 seconds. Uses 1 Amp LuV per queen. All bees are affected by 64x acceleration and 8 Production Upgrades as well as a Genetic Stabilizer Upgrade. The IAADDS also simulates a perfect environment for all bees.%n%nYou can provide royal jelly to increase the outputs. 1 royal jelly grants 5%% bonus per bee. They will be consumed on each start of operation and be applied to that operation only. The maximum bonus is 200%%. The normal bee stats still apply of course, though the IAADDS is able to provide a perfect environment for any bee.%n%nOPERATING MODE - SWARMER: In this mode you can only insert 1 queen. The IAADDS will then slowly produce ignoble princesses for 100 royal jelly per operation. The base processing time is 1 minute but you can overclock this process. The base usage is 1 Amp IV.%n%n§3Yes you need thousands of queens, not princesses.

After 10 seconds of flight, the pearl is automatically destroyed without any teleportation or fall damage.%n%nIncreased range (String)%nUnlike the no gravity effect, the pearl will fall down due to gravity, but will do so 25%% slower. If the pearl has the no gravity effect too, it will override this effect.%n%nDouble speed (Gold Nugget)%nIncreases the pearl's speed by a factor of 2, but won't change the flight trajectory. This can be helpful if you are in a bad situation (fell in lava, swarm of mobs around...) and need to be saved very quickly. In combination with the riding effect, you may notice slight stuttering on a server.%n%nExplosive (Gunpowder)%nUpon landing, the pearl will explode with radius of 2.7 (TNT has radius of 4). This will not harm the thrower as long as they are far enough from the landing spot.%n%nFreeze (Snowball) %nThe pearl will freeze mobs and players within 5 blocks of the landing spot for at least 4 seconds. Just as with the explosive effect, this will not affect the thrower unless they throw the pearl close to them, or have the riding effect applied. This effect is also followed by ice cracking sound and snow particles.%n%nRiding (Lead)%nThe thrower will "ride" the pearl to its destination. During the ride, if another pearl with this effect is thrown, the previous pearl will destroy itself and deal fall damage (unless No fall damage effect is applied).%n%nTrivia:%nThe Enhanced Ender Pearls can still be used for crafting an Eye of Ender.

# Quest: Tube Madness
betterquesting.quest.xoH_knd-RV-22QEfLUtuDA.name=Tube Madness
betterquesting.quest.xoH_knd-RV-22QEfLUtuDA.desc=So you want to move essentia from your Alchemical furnace to your warded Jars without getting it all gunked up with different essentia types?%n%nWell you came to the right place, with the use of buffered tubes and your handy wand you can move your essentia in tubes to fill all your jars without having to manually break and replace one jar at a time.%n%nTo create a simple setup place the buffered tubes in a main line from your Arcane Alembic with tubes coming out of the main buffered tube line. These standard tubes will then go directly into a warded jar. To get the essentia to flow correctly into the buffered tubes, shift right click the output side of the buffered tube with your wand untill it is red. This will change the band to a red band which will limit the suction of the Essentia.%n%nThe Essentia will be forced from the buffered tube to a normal tube then into your Warded jars. Chain your buffered tubes as needed untill all your Warded Jars will fit.%n§4%nNote: This system will get gunked up with essentia if any of your Warded Jars are full!%n%n§rIf you would like more information please check out the guide 'A Thaumaturge Guide to Laying Pipe' by xlstadal for more indepth Thaumcraft 4 Tube knowledge.%n%n§9§n[url]https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fMvJ5HbeOdy4UgBMe47cggis02idxWoMDgK81SgowEo[/url]§r

# Quest: Witchy (Wo)man
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4A.name=Witchy (Wo)man
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4A.desc=If you've made the spinning wheel and done the research, you can make these.%n%nThe vis discount is very useful both to craft more efficiently and to ease your wand progression. Maybe you should look around for more discounts?

# Quest: Searching for Answers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4Q.name=Searching for Answers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4Q.desc=Last night you had a dream. A dimension, so strange and different, almost... magical? Like the saplings you found. You decided to go there and look for answers.%n%nFirst, place water in a 2x2 grid, with 12 flowers surrounding it. Then toss in a portal crystal to open it up. And no, a diamond is not enough.%n%n§3You should be able to use any vanilla flower.

# Quest: See the Unseen
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4g.name=See the Unseen
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4g.desc=Everything is made of 6 primal aspects. Those aspects can be combined to form compound aspects, but in the end, there are only 6, kinda like the infused shards you found. You noticed that those shards start to vibrate when you bring them next to something that is made of the respective aspect. Maybe you can create a device to actually "scan" items, and reveal their compounds? This could be very useful later on.

# Quest: A Table to Work On
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4w.name=A Table to Work On
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4w.desc=Now you need something on which to craft magical items. It probably needs to be a little magical itself. Let's see what the book says.%n%n§3I should probably take this time to read all the stuff in the Thaumonomicon I don't know about while I'm at it, instead of posting on Discord and looking stupid.

# Quest: Infused Stones
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA5Q.name=Infused Stones
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA5Q.desc=This whole place here is filled with magic. No matter where you look at, it's just everywhere. You wonder what happens to regular stone if it's exposed to large amounts of magic for such a long time. Maybe it's time to go mining?%n%nThere are 3 veins. There's amber and cinnabar in each. They aren't super useful, but make sure to keep hold of some at least.

# Quest: Your First Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA5g.name=Your First Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA5g.desc=You're sure that this place will give you all the answers you're looking for! To continue, you need something to handle the magic energy called "vis". Guess it's time to craft your first wand.%n%nIf you haven't started on defeating the TF bosses yet, you'll need to do so to proceed. All wands require some kind of TF boss drop, with better wands needing later boss's drops. Once you've defeated them once, you can buy a spawn egg (only usable in the TF) or use the trophy+salis mundus to make more of the drop.%n%n§3You should look for wand recipes in NEI. Not all of them are correct in the Thaumonomicon.

# Quest: Tome of Knowledge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA5w.name=Tome of Knowledge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA5w.desc=All the things you've discovered so far, you need to write them down. But you're lazy, and you have a wand, so why not try a magical way to "write down" your research? You wonder if you could enchant a book with your wand, so that it will keep track of your progress... You should try that on a bookshelf!

# Quest: Improving Your Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA6A.name=Improving Your Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA6A.desc=Your wand does a great job in storing and releasing vis as you please. However, those iron caps are... §oweak§r. If you don't pay enough attention to it, it might hurt the node. They also make crafting harder. Maybe you should try to improve it with caps made out of a more valuable material. Like... gold, perhaps?

# Quest: Getting Shards
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA6Q.name=Getting Shards
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA6Q.desc=Now that you've found all six types of infused stone, you need to break those up in order to get the shards. The easiest way to do that, is to throw these stones in your Forge Hammer. Later when you have a Sifter, you can sift purified ores for more shards. An autoclave can turn shard dust into a shard. Maybe there's a magical way to do the same thing?

# Quest: A "Greater" Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA6g.name=A "Greater" Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA6g.desc=While doing all your research and mining of these infused stones, you had an idea how to use the wood of a Greatwood tree to make a new wand. Actually, it turned out to be pretty simple, but you lacked one important thing back then: vis! The vis makes sure the wood doesn't lose it's magical conductivity while forming the rod.

# Quest: Better Screws
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA6w.name=Better Screws
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA6w.desc=Unfortunately, your aluminium screws don't work with the greatwood rod. Somehow, the wood seems to repel the material. Luckily, you already have a blast furnace, so you can get a better material than aluminium.

# Quest: A More Powerful "Scale"
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7A.name=A More Powerful "Scale"
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7A.desc=The naga scales are weak, they can only hold a very limited amount of vis. You need a better, more powerful component to store vis in your wand. You've heard rumors about an evil wizard in the Twilight Forest. Maybe he has... something... that can be used?

# Quest: "Stores 50 Vis" Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7Q.name="Stores 50 Vis" Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7Q.desc=With gold caps you avoid the downsides of iron. So best to upgrade to a Gold Banded Greatwood Wand!%n%nWith this you are more powerful than ever! You have a feeling that this new wand will come in handy very soon.%n%n§3Going forward the wand quests will not focus on caps. You now know that wands with iron caps are the cheapest to make, but gold caps are better. You should also explore what other caps exist, they might be even better!%nIron caps being the cheapest however does not mean that you always need to start with an iron cap wand, only to make a better one. Instead, you should be starting to stack crafting discounts from various sources! If you don't have at least 10%% discount on your gear right now, you should probably look around this questtab to improve on that.

# Quest: Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7g.name=Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7g.desc=Your arcane table does a great job with infusing primal vis into items while crafting. However, you feel that there must be more. What if you could infuse items with all kinds of magic aspects? The possibilities are endless...

# Quest: Essentia Cooking
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA8A.name=Essentia Cooking
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA8A.desc=In order to get essentia, you need to dissolve items. Obviously, you only want to dissolve those items you don't really need, and only those with essentia you need to craft things.%n%nMake sure you keep your furnace as empty as possible. If it fills up with essentia, it can cause a large TPS drop.

# Quest: Not For Soup
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA8Q.name=Not For Soup
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA8Q.desc=At least not for edible soup, but for essentia slurry. Get yourself a cauldron and give it a solid whack with your wand. Place some netherrack 2 blocks under the crucible and set it on fire with some flint and steel. Lastly you need to fill it with water. This one works with pipes, so you can automate that.%n%nNow you can do crucible recipes!%n%nJust don't put in too much or, well, Bad Things will happen.

# Quest: Balanced Shards sdrahS decnalaB
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA8g.name=Balanced Shards sdrahS decnalaB
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA8g.desc=By combining all six primal aspects in a crucible, you are able to make balanced shards. They can be ground up into "Salis Mundus", an absolutely crucial thing to have, trust me!

# Quest: The Choice...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA9Q.name=The Choice...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA9Q.desc=By now, you should've collected a few (or a lot) of locations for aura nodes to get vis from. You might also have noticed that you're probably low on a certain aspect, like ordo or ignis. Well, good news. In exchange for some crystal clusters, I will give you one of my old nodes. They're all pale, but they'll still help you out. You may only choose one, so think twice before you make your decision.

# Quest: Not Just For Decoration
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-w.name=Not Just For Decoration
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-w.desc=Sure, they look pretty, but they serve a much more important purpose: Channeling vast amounts of vis and essentia. Your first uses will be an infusion setup and an alchemical furnace.

# Quest: This is the End...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA_A.name=This is the End...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA_A.desc=...of your apprenticeship. You have mastered all 6 primal aspects, you mastered the weak and strong infusion of essentia and vis, and you've already made your adept wand. But be warned, young one. The further you progress, the more darkness, and evil will tempt you to follow the forbidden ways of magic. I have seen things... weather changing, random teleportation, or even a Wither tearing its way into our universe right next to someone. Be careful, my friend...

# Quest: Turning Liquids Into Essentia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA_Q.name=Turning Liquids Into Essentia
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA_Q.desc=What a simple idea. So many people waste tons of buckets just to get aqua from water, or sano from milk. Why didn't they just dissolve the liquid itself? Idiots...

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA_g.desc=This nifty little device will filter essentia out of an Alchemical Crucible or Alchemical Boiler.

There's also quests for the boss kills on the kill all the things tab. You can only get one map every 24 hours, so be careful with it.%n%n§4Only use the map in the Twilight Forest, using the map in any other dimension will lag the server!

To do the research, you need a scribing tool and the research note you made in the research table, so you should probably make two tools.%n%nNote: Thaumcraft Research Tweaks has reworked the research table GUI.

# Quest: Cursed Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAETw.name=Cursed Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAETw.desc=You can kill the powered-up monsters that spawn on the cursed earth, or just sleep and despawn them. Use a shovel with the silk touch enchantment to dig up the cursed earth blocks. You can use these blocks to make a mob spawner, or place one under a vanilla spawner to let it run even when you're not around.%n%nWhen setting up a mob spawner in the Nether using Cursed Earth, poor design can cause huge TPS issues.%n%nMake sure the Cursed Earth is not attached to anything from the Nether. For example, you can place it on top of marble, but the marble cannot touch anything in the nether (netherrack, brick, etc), and must be floating in the air. Also, limit the Cursed Earth to 1 chunk max, with 2 block buffer to the chunk edge, including a wall.

# Quest: Silky Jewel
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEUA.name=Silky Jewel

# Quest: Creating a Better Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCQ.name=Creating a Better Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCQ.desc=This greatwood wand is nice, but it can only store 50 vis. Not enough to move nodes. My attempts to use silverwood failed, but I've come across other mundane materials that I could use to make a new wand core.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCg.name=More Energetic Screws to Finish the New Wand
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCg.desc=Those stainless steel screws don't work on these rods. Due to the huge amounts of vis those wands can carry, the screws somehow "melt" away. I need a material that can handle these energies. I should try energetic alloy next.%n%n§3If you are struggling to make the next wand in this step or one of the next, you should try to get more discount on your gear.%n%nAlso look at the various caps, the better ones are more expensive to craft but give discounts or other benefits.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEw.desc=Many advanced machines require vis in order to do what they're supposed to.

(It seems that the pulsating pearl you just found cured your brain from... something. Something old, probably some kind of trap to keep away unworthy ones.)%n%n§3/iskamiunlocked will tell you if you have successfully unlocked Kami. If not, try researching the Thaumium Crowbar and the Cursed Spirits Blade. Or other stuff on the vanilla pages. Or in TT. It's not really reliable anymore with all the mods and such.

# Quest: Concentrated Darkness
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHQ.name=Concentrated Darkness
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHQ.desc=For some reason, you decided to infuse darkness into a seed. It appeared to be promising. For what? You don't know...%n%n§3For the Eldritch research you need to be > 30 for the first, and > 50 for the second. Temporary warp won't work, however.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABKw.desc=Manually checking your jars can be tedious, especially if you want to infuse a bunch of stuff at once. Luckily, the essentia locus can help you with that, as it monitors all jars that have been targeted with a crystalline eye.

# Quest: Cleaning the Goo
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABLA.name=Cleaning the Goo
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABLA.desc=As you do more and more infusions, you're getting tired of removing all the flux that's generated.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAESQ.desc=Litmus paper will tell you how high your warp level is, but how can you get rid of the nasty warp effects?

# Quest: Stable Division Sigil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEUQ.name=Stable Division Sigil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEUQ.desc=The second ritual will not be as easy as the first one. After this ritual your sigil will be stable enough to make stable unstable ingots which will not explode, and will no longer take durability damage.%n%nThis ritual needs to be performed in The End dimension. The ritual is performed by placing a Beacon in the center of a flat area of at least 11x11, not necessarily End Stone. Then place a chest in each of the cardinal directions leaving 4 spaces empty between the chest and the Beacon. In each chest insert these specific contents:%n%nNorth: iron ingot, gold ingot and the other things listed in the task.%nSouth: The different Ore Blocks and the other things listed in the task.%nEast: The potions.%nWest: The Music disks.%n%nA spiral pattern of Redstone and String is then laid out around the beacon. At any time, Shift+Right-clicking the Beacon with an Activated Division Sigil in hand will show the building progress of the ritual.%n%nFinally, kill an Iron Golem while it stands within the ritual area to activate the process. If it works, there will be an explosion that destroys the beacon and chests, while every Enderman in the End vanishes. During the ritual, throngs of aggresive mobs imbued with Haste will begin spawning and attacking the Player who needs to kill 100 of them to complete the ritual. If the Player dies or leaves the dimension, the ritual will fail and will have to be started over. Once enough mobs have been killed, the first activated Sigil in the inventory will stabilize. The Pseudo-Inversion Sigil can be used an unlimited number of times, and dividing an Iron Ingot by Diamond will produce Mobius "Unstable-Stable" Ingot which does not explode, can be produced in any crafting interface and will stack up to 64.

# Quest: Magic "Staffter"
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEpw.name=Magic "Staffter"
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEpw.desc=It is also possible to create a bizarre hybrid of staff and scepter (sometimes called a "staffter"), by using a staff core instead of a wand core in the scepter recipe. The resulting device can neither hold a focus nor be placed in a crafting table, but it can still be used to activate constructs, or as a "vis battery" for Repair-enchanted equipment or Runic shielding.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFZg.name=Pimp Your Wand Focus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFZg.desc=The Manipulator requires both XP levels and centi-vis in order to upgrade foci. Each Focus can be upgraded a total of five times, with the level and vis cost increasing by 8 for each upgrade. Some upgrades can be applied only at certain levels (often only at level 3), and others have prerequisite upgrades. Some upgrades like Frugal and Potency can be applied multiple times. All upgrades are permanent, and there is currently no way to remove them.

# Quest: Advanced Node Stabilizer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFZw.name=Advanced Node Stabilizer
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFZw.desc=The advanced node stabilizer acts like a normal node stabilizer but with key differences. It will still stop the node it affects from being drained but the node can still drain from other, lesser nodes. It also has a higher chance to improve fading and unstable nodes. The downside is that any nodes it affects will have their recharge rates effectively reduced to nothing. They will recharge at an extremely reduced rate.

# Quest: Infuse Your Focus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFeQ.name=Infuse Your Focus
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFeQ.desc=Try to add Potency to your Shock Focus. At Level 3 you can add Chain Lightning or Shock Wave.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHUw.name=A Soul-ution For Warp
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHUw.desc=The Soul Brazier from Thaumic Exploration will store your permanent warp. %n%nAs long as it has Ignis centi-vis and Mortuus essentia fed from underneath it will stay active, even while you are in other dimensions.

You'll need to figure out a way to stop that.

# Quest: Wand Enhancements
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHyA.name=Wand Enhancements
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHyA.desc=Thaumic Machina offers Wand Augmentations. These useful modifications to your wand can boost their capacity, lower their vis usage, or do other interesting effects.

# Quest: A Magical Box
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH5A.name=A Magical Box
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH5A.desc=This magical box is amazing. No matter how many are created, they all seem to connect to the same dimension. I can store items in one location, and pull them out somewhere else!%n%nI can use dyes on the top of the box to assign its location, and any box with the same colors will share the same space. Using a diamond on the box locks it to me, and me alone.%n%nShift-rightclicking will remove the diamond and the chest will rejoin the public network.

# Quest: A Magical Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH5Q.name=A Magical Tank
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH5Q.desc=This tank always seems to connect to the same dimensional space. I can push fluids into the tank in one dimension, and retrieve them in a totally different dimension!%n%nI have discovered a way to assign a location to each tank using dyes applied to the top. Using a diamond makes the tank private, attuned to the user's mind, and will not share fluids with any other player's tanks.%n%nShift-rightclicking recovers the diamond and makes the tank part of the public tank network again.%n%nThe dial on front controls the input/output of the tank. When blue is up, the tank accepts fluids. When orange is up, the tank will eject fluids.%n%n§3If you get FPS problems from large numbers of them, try the setting in the config to turn off the fancy render at the bottom.

# Quest: That Chest is Too Big to Carry Around
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH5g.name=That Chest is Too Big to Carry Around
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH5g.desc=Instead of chest you have to keep placing and breaking, how about a nice convenient pouch you can use? You'll have to synchronize it with the chest you want to link with. To set it to a new chest, sneak-click with the pouch on a new chest.

# Quest: Healing Your Nodes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIEA.name=Healing Your Nodes

# Quest: A Travel Companion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI2w.name=A Travel Companion
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI2w.desc=Lonely? The Traveling Trunk is a simple companion, giving you some extra space. With upgrades (one per trunk) it can offer you some nice advantages. Like other golems, you can pick it up with the Golemancer's Bell. It's brain is pretty small though, so it can easily get stuck. You can order it to stay in one spot via the GUI. It will attempt to teleport to you, as long as the chunk is still loaded. It can also follow you into different dimensions.%n%nThey will heal slowly on their own, or faster if you right-click on them with any food, including rotten meat. Keep away from lava.%n%nGolem upgrade effects:%nAer: Moves faster%nEarth: 1 more row of item slots%nFire: Attacks hostile mobs, setting them on fire%nWater: Nearly invulnerable. In SMP, can only be opened or picked up by player who placed it.%nEntropy: Sucks in loose items nearby if it has room%nOrder: Can be picked up with its contents, and nested in other inventories. Don't be stupid about this.

# Quest: Who Needs Friends?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI3A.name=Who Needs Friends?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI3A.desc=Luggage is better than a dumb old traveling trunk. It automatically picks up dropped items, saving you time while mining. It's near-invulnerable, including in lava. It will follow you like an eager puppy, to the ends of the earth - but you probably should pick her up before changing dimensions. A lightning strike can provide more room. Shift right-clicking will turn it back into an item without losing its contents. Look for her in the GTNH tab of the Thaumonomicon.

# Quest: Fool's Gold
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJaw.name=Fool's Gold
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJaw.desc=After holding a Primal Charm for a while, you suddenly understand some of it's whispers! It tells of a land filled with untold riches, just waiting for someone to claim them. You scoff at the claim, but apparently if you "Open the Eye" and create a very fancy carved stone, you can create a portal there. But this eye it speaks of...just what is it? Maybe by delving into the darker realm of magic...bah! Only fools would believe such nonsense.

# Quest: Gen XXXXXXXXXX...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJbA.name=Gen XXXXXXXXXX...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJbA.desc=Yes! Yes! The eyes! You understand now, it is all too clear! The land of riches, it is yours! But what is this? It's empty? Why, where have your Riches gone? The sole inhabitant tells you that all such things have faded away long ago, with the End of Time at hand...But that simply means you're in the right PLACE after all! You're simply in the wrong TIME. If you simply adjust the portal a little, you can arrive at the right PLACE and TIME to get your well-deserved Riches. You suspect that such an adjustment would require something strong...INFINITELY strong.%n%nIn the meantime you now have a very very big closet to store your things in once the old owner...moves out. Upon leaving, you spot a tiny Ghast, surely just your imagination? Unfortunately the shifting of time causes you to end up in what is likely wilderness when you leave. (Exiting through the portal sends you back to the world spawn)%n%nIn order to build a machine to take you to both the right place and time, you're going to have to roll up your sleeves and get to the very limits of technological prowess you can imagine. (see the Endgame Goals tab when you're ready)

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMiA.name=So many options for the core!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMiA.desc=So many options for my next wand core! The six elemental options are icy, blazing, bone, obsidian, reed, and quartz. They are all pretty similar.%n%nThe last two options are more interesting. A transmutative wand has the same capacity while being cheaper to craft! It also has a nice ability that makes it easier to charge.%n%nAt last, the thaumium core creates a wand with a slightly higher capacity. But it is also more expensive to craft than the others. Depending on your discounts you might not be able to get it immediately and have to go for one of the other options first.%n%n§3You only need to do one of the tasks.

# Quest: Ignore the Glint in Their Eyes

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMlA.name=The roots of magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMlA.desc=If you're familiar with Botania, you will notice that the overworld is noticeably void of magical flowers and mushrooms. Such pretty expressions of magic sadly require you to have leveled up on your magical skills. For now you will have to make do with what the world has to offer.%n%nLook in deep caves in the Twilight Forest at low Y-levels for glimmering mushrooms. These are your starting ingredient and can be used instead of flower petals. Beware, unlike flowers you can't grow more just yet, so be careful what you use them for.

# Quest: Flower grafting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMlQ.name=Flower grafting

# Quest: Mana diamonds
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMmg.name=Mana diamonds
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMmg.desc=Mana diamonds are magically enhanced diamonds, and they require more or less energy depending on the quality of the gem you're trying to enchant.%n%nA completely full diluted pool is barely able to make a mana diamond out of an exquisite diamond. Once you upgrade the pool you can use regular diamonds - be it at a higher mana cost.

# Quest: A deal with Alfar Industries
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMoA.name=A deal with Alfar Industries
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMoA.desc=So the rumors about the elves are true. Well, §owere§r true. Some are still true. And what isn't true used to be true.%n%nTurns out they have since been talking to a mysterious individual they call the §oDream Master§r.

# Quest: Moron's Manual for Mana Manufacture And Manipulation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtQ.name=Moron's Manual for Mana Manufacture And Manipulation
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtQ.desc=To use the power of magical flowers, you must understand how to generate and manipulate mana. This ethereal blue-ish substance is produced by generating flowers, when their requirements are met. Mana is not easily quantified, so you will have to do a lot of estimating if you want to use it efficiently.%n%nOnce you have chosen which flower you want to use to generate mana, you must plant it near a mana spreader. When the flower's conditions are fulfilled, it will begin to produce mana, and store it in the internal buffer of the nearest mana spreader. The mana spreader itself will automatically emit any mana it contains, provided it is aimed at a valid destination (such as a mana pool). You'll need a lot of these devices, so craft a pair for now.%n%nMana spreaders will aim towards you when you place them down. To change their direction, use a wand of the forest: while holding the wand, shift+right click on the mana spreader, and then shift+right click on the block you want it to aim at. This method of binding also works for other things, such as binding a flower to a specific mana spreader.

# Quest: Solar Power: Floral Edition

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtg.desc=The daybloom is an extremely simple generating flower. All you have to do is place it down, and it'll produce mana for free during the day.

# Quest: Hydrobotanic Energy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtw.name=Hydrobotanic Energy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMtw.desc=Mana is blue. Water is also blue. There's a correlation there, and the hydroangea turns that correlation into causation. Place a water source block nearby, and the hydroangea will consume it to produce mana - until it dies after an hour.%n%nThis one can be a bit tricky to automate given the lack of naturally-regenerating source blocks.

# Quest: Dark Energy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMuA.name=Dark Energy
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMuA.desc=Perhaps not the kind of "dark energy" you're familiar with, the nightshade produces mana at night. Like other passive generating flowers, it dies after an hour.

# Quest: Is this a combustion generator?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMuQ.name=Is this a combustion generator?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMuQ.desc=The endoflame burns combustible materials in order to produce mana. It can efficiently consume fuels with a burn time of up to 64000 per item (equivalent to four blocks of coal); any burn time beyond this will be wasted. Endoflames don't die like passive flowers do, and are simple to use, so it's a good idea to make several of them.

# Quest: A Botanist's Best Friend
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMug.name=A Botanist's Best Friend
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMug.desc=Functional flowers are a large part of Botania.

This questline will explain the basics, but be sure to keep a copy of the Lexica Botania on hand so you can easily reference the details.%n%nBesides being a repository of useful information, the Lexica Botania has another function: if, while holding it, you look at any Botania block in the world, you can shift+right click on that block to open up the relevant page.%n%nSomething else you'll want for functional flowers is a handful of redstone roots. Flowers which have a redstone root in their recipe have the ability to toggle whether they are active by applying a redstone signal. Make a few before you move on.

# Quest: Anti-Magnetism
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMuw.name=Anti-Magnetism
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMuw.desc=If you've made a ring of magnetization, you may be getting tired of having to take it off around various Botania systems that require items to be on the ground in order to interact with flowers. The solegnolia is your solution to that. Simply place one down anywhere you don't want items to be automatically put in your inventory, and the ring of magnetization will be disabled while you're in the vicinity of the solegnolia. It doesn't even require mana!

# Quest: Violence Is Blue
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvA.name=Violence Is Blue

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvQ.name=Roses Are Blood-Red
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvQ.desc=The bellethorne is a delightful little flower with an §c§c§r§4insatiable thirst for blood§r, though fortunately your blood doesn't count.

It's a good extra layer of defence to place at the entrances to your early-game bamboo fortress.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvg.desc=You'll need mana powder to proceed. Make four to start out with.

# Quest: Better Generating Flowers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvw.name=Better Generating Flowers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMvw.desc=If you want anything better than an endoflame, you'll need a runic altar. Fortunately, most runes are easily crafted as soon as you can make the runic altar. Sinful runes, however, require titanium to make. For now, just make one of each of the elemental runes; that'll be enough to get you started.

# Quest: Shut down your canning machine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwA.name=Shut down your canning machine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwA.desc=Some flowers eat bees. Some eat leaves. Some eat slimes. This one eats everything (everything you can eat, anyway). The gourmaryllis is happiest when provided with a good variety of delicious meals, so I hope the HV-tier diet of canned sludge hasn't made you forget how to cook.

# Quest: Experienced Botanist
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwQ.name=Experienced Botanist
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwQ.desc=The rosa arcana transmutes experience into mana. A player standing near it will have their experience drained for this purpose. This process is unfortunately not very practical to automate, as the experience can only be extracted directly from a player, and not from orbs on the ground or any method of storage. It might be wise to place it somewhere you spend a lot of time.

# Quest: Mmmmmm, Slimy!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwg.name=Mmmmmm, Slimy!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwg.desc=Have you ever seen a slime and thought "I'd love to eat that"?

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMww.name=Flower!!! Unlimited Flower!!!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMww.desc=The jaded amaranthus causes mystical flowers to grow all around it.

# Quest: Obligatory Lava Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMxA.name=Obligatory Lava Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMxA.desc=The thermalily consumes lava, but it's not quite as simple as just constantly replenishing a lava pool. There's a cooldown that you'll have to account for. Even so, it's a fairly easy flower to automate if you have a good lava source.

# Quest: Chickenization
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMxQ.name=Chickenization
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMxQ.desc=The soarleander generates mana by consuming anything chicken-related, including entire chickens.

Activating the oven to show the interface screen, you will see an additional slot to the right of the fuel slot. Clay jars must be placed in this slot. If there are clay jars present when something is cooked, there is a chance a by-product will be captured in one of the jars. These by-products are important ingredients in other recipes. If there are no clay jars in the oven when something is cooked, no by-products will be produced.%n%nUpgrading an Oven%n%nAn oven can be upgraded by placing either a Fume Funnel or a Filtered Fume Funnel to the left and right of it. Each Fume Funnel will increase the cooking speed by and additional 10 percent (over a furnace) and increase the chance of a by-product being produced by and additional 25 percent for a Fume Funnel or 30 percent for a Filtered Fume Funnel.%n%nA fully upgraded oven will therefore cook at 130 percent speed (compared to a furnace) and have a chance of a by-product of 90 percent.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABTQ.desc=For all your offering needs. And of course, it looks fancy!%n%nAn altar is created by placing six altar blocks in a 2x3 pattern; you will know it's correct when a red cloth appears over the top of the altar.%n%nRight-clicking on it will bring up a screen showing how much power the altar has collected, how much it can collect and its current recharge rate. It is important to check that there is sufficient available power to perform a given rite or use a distillery, or certain kettle or cauldron recipes.%n%nThe maximum amount of power available is determined by how many natural items are in the vicinity of the altar: dirt, grass, trees, plants, etc. all contribute; stone and sand do not. The important thing is to have a diverse mix of different plants, trees and crops (plants from other mods are supported to an extent as well). Read a wiki for details.%n%nCertain objects (or foci), placed onto an altar, will boost the focusing capabilities of an altar, either improving the amount of magic it can focus, the rate at which it replenishes or the range it can distribute power. Only one of each type of item (skull, chalice, etc.) will have an effect. There may also be other less savory foci that dark magic practitioners could make use of.

# Quest: ...Cauldron Bubble
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABTg.name=...Cauldron Bubble
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABTg.desc=The second thing you'll need is a cauldron. It is used to craft most of the basic items, like mutandis. It requires anointing paste, which you will need an MV mixer to make. It is made by placing a regular Cauldron in the world, and then using Anointing Paste on it.%n%nTo brew a potion, cast a ritual or create an item, the cauldron must first be filled with water. This can be achieved by using three buckets of water on it, pumping water into it using pipes, or by using a Dispenser containing a Brew of Endless Water.%n%nOnce a cauldron is full of water, it must boil. Lighting a fire beneath the cauldron is the only way for this to happen. Using a netherrack block will guarantee the fire does not go out, although if it does go out, it may be set to boil again without any consequences (unlike brewing in a Kettle!).%n%nWhen the water is boiling, ingredients may be added to the Cauldron (one after another), to create the desired effect. The book, Witches' Brews gives a complete overview of all ingredients and what they can do when added to a brew.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABUA.name=Probably Usable For Soup
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABUA.desc=But its main purpose is to brew potions and infusions.%n%nA kettle must be set up in the correct way before it can be used. %n%nFirstly, a fire must be set under the kettle (netherrack is best for this, but wood will do just as well). %n%nNext the kettle must be filled. You can use pipes to automate this. %n%nThirdly, each of the six ingredients for the brew or infusion must be thrown into the kettle, one at a time (the liquid will change color according to the recipe being used). %n%nFinally, a glass bottle must be used on the kettle to bottle the resulting brew, this must be done multiple times depending on the recipe.%n%nIt is important to keep the fire going constantly while the recipe is being prepared, otherwise it will be ruined. Swirls coming from the kettle is a sign all is well, black smoke (and brown liquid) indicates the brew is ruined. When a brew is ruined, the kettle must be emptied with a glass bottle, or just filled with more water, and the whole process repeated.%n%nWhen a brew is complete, the liquid will be the color of the resulting brew and will splutter (in addition to white swirls).%n%nSome recipes will require magical energy from a nearby Altar before they are bottled. If the brew is bottled when insufficient energy is available, the brew will be ruined. Black swirls coming from the Kettle is a good sign there is not enough power. A kettle must be within 14 (to 16) blocks of an Altar in order to obtain power from it (it can obtain power only from a single altar).

They are used to make Mutating Sprigs and Mystic Branches. %n%nThey will appear occasionally when trees such as Rowan, Hawthorn and Alder are felled in large quantities.%n%nEnts are rather hard to kill by normal means, but they do have a healthy hatred of certain tools for some reason or another.%n%nTwilight Forest Moss Patch and Biomes 'o Plenty moss will drop also.

# Quest: Redstone Soup?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJIw.name=Redstone Soup?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJIw.desc=Redstone soup is a witches brew that forms the base for all infusions, although it does have other uses.%n%nFilling a chalice with redstone soup will increase its magical affinity and upgrade it to a filled chalice, doubling its effectiveness.%n%nDrinking redstone soup will boost the health of the drinker for a few minutes.%n%nRedstone Soup is made in a kettle. Into the pot, throw Redstone, Drop of Luck, Wool of Bat, Tongue of Dog, Belladonna and Mandrake Root.

# Quest: Chalice
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJJA.name=Chalice
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJJA.desc=The chalice is an upgrade for an altar that improves the maximum amount of power an altar can hold. The chalice will increase the maximum power by 1x the base power rate.%n%nThe chalice upgrades to the Filled Chalice. Only one chalice upgrade will have an effect on an altar.

# Quest: Arthana
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJJQ.name=Arthana
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJJQ.desc=An Arthana is a ritualistic knife use by witches and warlocks to both collect special ingredients and to perform some rites. It has the same general properties as a golden sword (damage, enchantability, etc.), although it has the durability of an iron sword. It is repaired with a Gold Ingot.%n%nThe main purpose of the dagger is to collect specialist ingredients used in witchcraft, and to this end it will dramatically improve the chance of a mob dropping such ingredients (e.g. Wool of Bat, Tongue of Dog, etc.). It also gives a small chance of undead dropping Spectral Dust.%n%nWhen only using vanilla Minecraft with Witchery (and no other mods), an Arthana dagger is the only way to get a skull to drop when a skeleton is killed, the drop chance is about 5%% (the skull is a key upgrade for an altar). The dagger even gives a very small probability for other head drops (from mobs and players). All drop chances are increased with the Looting enchantment.%n%nAn Arthana does not change the drop chance for Wither Skeleton Skulls, that will require the Looting enchantment as usual.%n%nSome Circle Magic rites use an Arthana as a foci, the Arthana is not consumed in the process.

# Quest: Happenstance Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJJg.name=Happenstance Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJJg.desc=Happenstance Oil is an ingredient used in the production of a Crystal Ball and the Seer Stone.%n%nIt's created in a kettle using Redstone Soup, Potion of Night Vision (8:00), Eye of Ender, Golden Carrot, Spider Eye and Mandrake Root.

# Quest: Quartz Sphere
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJJw.name=Quartz Sphere
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJJw.desc=A Quartz Sphere is a component used in the production of a Crystal Ball and the Seer Stone for summoning coven witches.

# Quest: Seer Stone or Summon the Witches
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKA.name=Seer Stone or Summon the Witches
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKA.desc=A Seer Stone is a variation of a Crystal Ball, that allows witches to communicate with one another over great distances. It is mostly used by one witch to summon other members of their coven either to help out in a fight, or to help perform a ritual. The seer stone may also be used on another player to reveal if they are afflicted by a curse.%n%nTo summon a coven witch for aid, use the Seer Stone while held. Holding for longer summons more coven members.%n%nIf near a Witches' Cauldron, the summoned witches will circle it ready for a ritual.%n%nTo call the entire coven to perform a rite, start the rite normally while holding the Seer Stone.%n%nTo determine if another player is cursed, to find out if they have a coven or familiar, and how much time they can manifest for, use the Seer Stone on them when they are within 3 blocks distance. Sneak-using the stone will show the same information for the bearer of the Stone.%n%nA Seer Stone is created by infusing a Quartz Sphere with Obsidian and Happenstance Oil using a Rite of Infusion.

# Quest: Flame Imp
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKw.name=Flame Imp
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKw.desc=Flame Imps are demons strongly associated with fiery magic.%n%nNot as physically strong as their dimmer cousins, Flame Imps are mischievous creatures who are very easily swayed with the promise of personal gain. They may even be bound into the service of a witch (or warlock) if the offer is good enough.%n%nFlame Imps are summoned using a Rite of Summoning, and they are most likely to attack the first person they see. It is advisable to make a deal with them quickly.%n%nMaking a deal%n%nTo bind a Flame Imp into service, a witch must write the agreement into a Demonic Contract and sign it with their own blood (craft with a Taglock Kit). %nThis contract must then be given to the Flame Imp, who will require a down-payment of Experience Levels (typically 25).%n%nOnce a deal is struck, the imp will be bound to the location of the deal, not able to wander too far away. The Imp will attack anyone hostile to its master.%n%nImps like receiving valuable gifts, once suitably impressed an imp may be prepared to perform various flame related spells at the request of their master.%n%nSpells take the form of contracts describing what must be done and to whom. %nSimply craft a Demonic Contract with the necessary components and then the resulting contract with a taglock. %nThen give the contract to the Imp. So long as the creature is in the same dimension, the magic will take hold.%n%nA Flame imp may also occasionally give a gift in return for being given valuable things. These have been known to include the souls of demons that can be consumed to allow a witch to cast demonic spells. %n%nA very well treated Flame Imp may even yield knowledge to summon a Lord of Torment.%n%n

# Quest: Lord of Torment
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJLA.name=Lord of Torment
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJLA.desc=A Lord of Torment is a mighty demonic being that is able to create prisons to Torment its victims.%n%nThose foolish enough to summon one of these creatures must prepare for an arduous fight.%n%nA Lord of Torment may only be summoned using the Ritual outlined in a Torment Scroll. %nThese scrolls are hard to come by, but it is rumored that well treated Flame Imps have occasionally given them up.%n%nConsuming the Soul of a Torment Demon grants the ability to Torment others.%n%nIf you are very unlucky and the Lord of Torment disappears when entering the Torment dimension, use the Egg and spawn another one.

# Quest: Mutating Sprig
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJUw.name=Mutating Sprig
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJUw.desc=The Mutating Sprig brings a degree of order to the chaotic nature of Mutandis, allowing more limited, but also more predictable effects. It is a key tool in the creation of plant-based devices such as the Leech Chest.%n%nThe Mutating Sprig is crafted in the crafting bench using an Ent Twig, Nether Wart and Mutandis Extremis.%n%nGrass - Mutates to Mycellium%nMycellium - Mutates to Grass%nDirt (under water) - Mutates to Clay%n%nWheat in a proper configuration should mutate to wormwood, but because of other mods it doesn't work. You can buy wormwood from the Coins tab instead.

# Quest: Changing Biomes With Witchery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcQ.name=Changing Biomes With Witchery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcQ.desc=There are two ways to change biomes with Witchery, the easy way or the hard way, choose which one you want to do (or do them both). Remember that you need a Witchery Distillery first!

# Quest: The Easy Way to Change Biomes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcg.name=The Easy Way to Change Biomes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcg.desc=So you want the easy way? Ok, go get this stuff:%nMandrake Root, Nether Wart, Tear of the Goddess, Diamond Vapor, and a Diamond.%n%nThen toss it in the Witch's Cauldron IN ORDER, before also tossing in a page from the Book of Biomes (Extended) (craft it with a piece of paper while on the page of the biome you want), followed by a bit of Gunpowder.%nThen just use a bottle to get the brew. If wearing your Robes or Hat, you may even get more than one! (If you have a ton of brewing expertise, which is unlikely)%n%nIf it failed, you may not have enough Altar Power, you need 5450 at least. Try placing down a Dragon Egg or Demon Heart if you're close. Check a wiki for more details on altar power.%n%nIf you want to have more than a single changed block, then add Glowstone Dust, Blaze Rod and Attuned Stone (Charged) in order to increase the effect (and Altar Power cost slightly) by +1 for each. Do this before adding in the page.%n%nFor more detailed info, check out the Witches' Brews book. Click on Brewing, then go to the Brews: Step-by-step page. This should tell you what you need to know. For what each of the brews actually does, see the Effects page. Only Effects use Capacity, and you can have multiple.

# Quest: The Hard Way to Change Biomes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcw.name=The Hard Way to Change Biomes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJcw.desc=Ok, to have a ritual with a size greater than zero, you need to get Coven Witches to acknowledge you and then agree to help you out. To get them to deign to speak with you, you can either infuse yourself or bind a familiar. In this quest line we'll be covering binding a familiar, but for the people who want to do infusion, you just need to make the appropriate item: Ghost of the Light, Soul of the World, Spirit of Otherwhere, or Infernal Animus, and do the appropriate Rite of Infusion. Be sure to have a Death Protection Poppet to protect you, because the ritual kills you. If playing hardcore, definitely test in a separate world first.%n%nTo bind a familiar, first, summon a Demon and tear out it's heart. No, seriously, go do it. Use an Arthana with Looting III for the best chances. If you don't know how to summon one, refer to page 49/50 of the Circle Magic book for the correct Rite of Summoning.%n%nYou'll need a Mutating Sprig for the next part.

# Quest: More Hearts for Valentines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdA.name=More Hearts for Valentines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdA.desc=If you want to get more hearts, you can try trading with the Demon, but they're more likely to shoot fireballs at you than trade. Unless you have this item that is! First, make the Polynesia Charm that allows you to trade with animals (probably not worth it in this pack), then use the demon heart to make the Devil's Tongue Charm. With this, not only are they a lot less likely to attack, they will even sell their brethren's hearts for a little less.%n%nJust remember that it can only be used a limited number of times, ok? It might also be worthwhile to use the Rite of Protection at the same time as summoning a demon. To do so just put down both circles, and meet the item (and Altar Power) requirements of both. If you're not planning on killing the demon, you should probably send it back when you're done with the Rite of Banishing on page 47/48 of the Circle Magic book.

# Quest: Are You Grassping What I'm Telling You?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdQ.name=Are You Grassping What I'm Telling You?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdQ.desc=To make Grasspers, first you need to arrange Grass in the cardinal directions around a Chest above a block of water. Then right-click the Chest with your Mutating Sprig.

# Quest: PETA Approved*
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdg.name=PETA Approved*
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdg.desc=To make Critter Snares, first you need to arrange Alder Saplings in the cardinal directions around a Cobweb above a block of water. Then get a zombie to walk onto it and right-click the Cobweb with your Mutating Sprig.%nThis will change the Saplings into the needed Critter Snares. Do this twice.%n%n§3* May not be PETA approved

# Quest: Mad Science is the Best Science
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdw.name=Mad Science is the Best Science
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJdw.desc=Next we need to fill our snares up with some critters, specifically Bats and Slimes. For the Bats, just place them beneath you and AFK if your warp is high enough to spawn bats, otherwise...uh, go caving?%n%nFor the Slimes, if you can't find any just use the Maze Slimes from the Minoshroom maze in the Twilight Forest for this. After you get them, also go collect a Wolf and an Ocelot (Lassos or Soul Vials are great for this).%n%nNow we'll be creating new life, specifically Toads and Owls. Arrange a Cobweb above a water block with grasspers at the diagonals and one of the two sets of snares in the cardinal directions. Place Attuned Stone (Charged) in one of the Grasspers, and Mutandis Extremis in the other 3. Then place one of the two animals in the center and right-click with your Mutating Sprig like when making the snares. Use the Wolf with the Bats, and the Ocelot with the Slimes. The tamed versions also work.%n%nCongratulations, you've defied the natural order and created new life! Hopefully they didn't run away because you created them outside :(%n%nMake sure to breed them for the next part. Use Raw Porkchop or Raw Beef for Owls, and Rotten Flesh for Toads to both tame and breed them.

# Quest: Finally Binding a Familiar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJeA.name=Finally Binding a Familiar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJeA.desc=Now that you have Toads and Owls, you can choose between them and Cats to bind. Why didn't we just bind a Cat earlier? Well, you'll need them both soon anyways, and who doesn't love choices? To carry out the Rite of Binding (P6, Circle Magic), you'll need to distill some Demonic Blood. Do that now, and collect the rest of the items needed.%n%nAfter collecting the items, bind your familiar using them. Make sure you have enough Altar Power. Remember that each has different benefits. See the official wiki for details. You may receive a tiny portion of damage your familiar receives (and vice-versa), so park it somewhere safe. Also note that if it dies, so will you (Supposedly). You can resummon it if it dies or was dismissed previously (like if you died). If you're in hardcore mode and don't want to risk having it around, it can be dismissed by right-clicking while sneaking when it's sitting.%n%nNow go murder a few of your new friends and tear of their Owlet's Wings, and cut off their Toe of Frog. Remember to use an Arthana. The next step needs a Seer's Stone.

# Quest: Greenhouses on Mountains, Hell on Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJeQ.name=Greenhouses on Mountains, Hell on Earth
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJeQ.desc=You're almost there! To actually use the ritual, you need to recruit a coven first. Find some Coven Witches and complete their quests:%nThe means to control the dead -> Necromantic Stone%nThe beating means to master the infernal dimension -> Demon Heart%nI must perform many curses, bring me the necessary brew -> Brew of the Grotesquex5%nI desire to predict the future -> Crystal Ball%nOr just fight something.%n%nOnce completed, they'll disappear until you need them. They will sometimes appear near your spawn point if you walk by it, so don't position it over lava or something, since they CAN die and reduce the number of your coven. You can have 6, with one extra appearing for Cauldron work. Consider keeping some extras around in a dungeon just in case.%n%nAfter you recruit your coven, you just need a few things for the ritual itself: Spider Eye, Toe of Frog, Wool of Bat, Tongue of Dog, Owlet's Wing, Attuned Stone, and Attuned Stone (Charged).%n%nTo specify the biome, look in the Book of Biomes, and find 1) the type (Forest, Plains, etc), and 2) the number. Type determines the foci used, and number determines the amount of Glowstone Dust used to get that specific biome. Make sure to pack up a ritual circle into a circle talisman so you don't have to redraw it, and bring some cobblestone to make a flat area (15x15, any height). Try not to do it at night unless you like dealing with infernals.%n%nTo actually do the ritual, have the ritual circle on the ground, the items (including the foci and Glowstone) in the circle, and right-click the center with the Seer's Stone.%n%nThe area affected is determined by the number of witches in your coven. It's 16 * (size of coven - 3) radius in a circular area, so 16/32/48 if it doesn't fail.%n%nUnfortunately, sometimes after logging out and back in again you may find that it didn't work correctly in specific chunks, this is (possibly) due to lack of chunk updates and it not saving the changed biome ID correctly. Just redoing the ritual doesn't really help, you'll just get patches in the same places, however placing water after the ritual and before logging out may help with this. Or use chickens. Lots of chickens.%n%nAlso, if you already have crops in the area, they'll disappear until a block update or relog.%n%n§3PS: To pack your circle back up, you need to bring your altar with you.%n

betterquesting.quest.s4B77B7FSamWlvHY8hfqqA.desc=The Mark of the Falling Tower is among the most powerful magic you can achieve in GTNH. It allows you to summon a huge meteor full of various GT ores right were you want it. All you need is a particular catalyst item and a good amount of LP. Even better, you sometimes get access to ores before you could get them normally! Check out NEI for all the possible meteors. For example you can start by looking at the uses of a Pufferfish.%n%nThe meteor requires at least a singular block to see the sky above the master ritual stone. You can use the alchemical component Terrae to increase the radius of the meteor by 1. Using Orbis Terrae increases the radius by 2.%n%nThe meteor deals some damage but it does not deal environmental/block damage. Just be weary if you have villagers or important mobs nearby. The size of the meteor also increases the damage & radius by an enormous amount.%n%nA multiblock miners can mine out the various ores spawned from the meteor, but there are other options too!

# Quest: Paying the Highest Price
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAoQ.name=Paying the Highest Price
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAoQ.desc=When regular magic just isn't enough, you need something... stronger. Which is paid with blood. Your blood, and maybe others'.%n%nIn tier 1 you only need to place the blood altar. Plan for the configuration to grow in size up to 23x23 for a single altar.%n%nKeep in mind that you get less blood, and use more when crafting in GTNH. Plan for pain and frustration too.%n%nThe altar has a 10,000L blood tank, plus a 1,000L I/O buffer (you can pump in and out, but the rate is pitifully low at the start). Blood will flow to the I/O buffer until it's full, so be aware of that before your first craft.

# Quest: Portable Battery...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAApA.name=Portable Battery...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAApA.desc=Using this binds it to you (expect to do that a lot), and consumes one heart while depositing 200LP in your 'soul network'. You can draw upon the soul network for anything that needs LP such as Alchemy or Rituals. If you want to automate it, you can put it into your altar for a 1:1 conversion of blood. %n%nThe highest tier orb you have bound will be considered the maximum limit to LP in your network, but you'll need to put it into the appropriately tiered altar to keep absorbing blood.

# Quest: Poke
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAsQ.name=§oPoke§r

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABmA.desc=It's quite difficult to see how much blood there is in your altar, or your personal blood network. This little device will solve that problem for you.

# Quest: Basic Rune

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABmQ.desc=The Blood Rune is the basic rune that makes up blood altars, expect to make a lot of them.%n%nYou need 8 runes for your tier 2 altar. You can make new stuff with your upgraded altar.

# Quest: Alchemy With Blood
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABmg.name=Alchemy With Blood
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABmg.desc=Not like "blood alchemy". You probably will need more than one later, but for now one is sufficient.%n%nPlace an orb in the slot to start crafting, using LP from your network.

### Quests in multiple quest lines ###

# Quest: Main Quests and Secondary Quests
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABA.name=§1§lMain Quests and Secondary Quests
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABA.desc=Now that you've made it this far,  you might notice how the two new quests look different. %n%nThe quest with the jagged edges is a main quest - it is linked to other main quests by a thick line. You must complete main quests to unlock the next tier and to progress in general. If you can't progress, go back to previous tiers and look for uncompleted main quests.%n%nThe other quest is an optional quest, and is not needed to unlock new tiers. However, optional quests often introduce you to useful items or processes.%n%nWhat are the coins for? You can use them to purchase things in the "Coins, Coins, Coins" questbook tab - you have to scroll to the bottom once it unlocks!%n%nIn case you started in a bad biome, here's enough coins to purchase some saplings.

# Quest: Sharpness: Over... 5...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACw.name=§1§lSharpness: Over... 5...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACw.desc=It's about time to craft something more useful: A sword!%n%nNow that you have a sword, you will get credit for monster kills in the Kill All the Things tab. Watch out, monsters in this world will chew you up and spit you out!%n%nYou can find additional weapon quests on the Getting Around tab.

# Quest: Steam-a-licious!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARg.name=§3§lSteam-a-licious!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARg.desc=You've almost made it. One last crafting step is required in order to advance to Tier 1. Keep going!%n%nThis Steam Turbine generates electricity from Steam. The power source you've been using is the same, but from this point on you will generate EU, and bring it to your machines via cables, instead of bringing the Steam directly to them. Luckily, electric machines don't need an exhaust port, and they are considerably more efficient than Bronze machines.%n%nAt a later point, you will most likely switch from Steam to another fuel, though.

# Quest: Dark Steel Tools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjA.name=§6§lDark Steel Tools
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjA.desc=There are also tools made of dark steel. Each of them can receive upgrades. Hold shift to get the tooltip which will explain what you need in order to upgrade them.%n%nThese tools can also be enchanted like vanilla tools.%n%nThe Ender will increase wither skull and ender pearl drops. It can be upgraded to teleport the player.%n%nDark shears can be empowered, and then will shear a large area, including leaves. Handy for clearing away that giant redwood! Maybe you will find other uses for it.%n%nThe axe, once empowered, can be recharged wirelessly while in farming station.%n%nThe pick? Well, it can mine cobalt I guess if you haven't gotten a tool capable of that yet. You could keep it around to use for base decorations if your normal pick is too fast, I suppose.

# Quest: And It Will Never Break
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmA.name=§9§lAnd It Will Never Break
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmA.desc=By using an etheric sword, your killer joe will run...forever. Proper enchantments are a requirement for it to be efficient, but that shouldn't be a problem.

# Quest: Appropriate Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAvg.name=§a§lAppropriate Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAvg.desc=Whether you used magic, steam, oil or biogas for power until now, you will run into problems as you advance to higher tiers. So you'll need to upgrade your power grid, at least for your EBF(s). So let's start with something more powerful: A nuclear reactor!%n%nIf you want to know how they work, refer to The Internet or the Reactor Planner at §9§n[url]https://github.com/MauveCloud/Ic2ExpReactorPlanner/releases[/url]§r%n%nNote: The EU multiplier is set to 10x in this pack. That means your nuclear reactor is 10 times more efficient. Make sure to set the planner to GTNH mode under advanced. Also, the base numbers (before 10xing) can be seen on the hover text for all the components.%n%nIf you just want to use them, go to §9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Nuclear_Reactors[/url]§r for reactor designs. The Thorium 1920 EU one is probably best for now.

# Quest: Basic Nuclear Fuel: Thorium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQ.name=§a§lBasic Nuclear Fuel: Thorium
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQ.desc=The weakest of all fuel rods, but very easy to produce, very easy to keep cool and runs twice as long as uranium. It even returns 1/3 of the thorium back later. A perfect "fission and forget" power source.%n%n§4Note: After they're used up you can recycle them to get Lutetium which is used for making americium in the fusion reactor. Americium is §lneeded§r§4 for top tier materials later, so start stockpiling now. Plus, you get power!

# Quest: Monitoring Your Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwg.name=§a§lMonitoring Your Reactor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwg.desc=It's important to monitor your reactor (Or just fancy to have a big screen somewhere...). So now that you've gained knowledge about the available fuel rods, you can start to build yourself a power plant. Here is something to help you out.%n%nUse the sensor kit on the block you want to monitor, then put the sensor card in the display panel. Next select which lines of information you want to display.

# Quest: Increasing the Capacity
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAww.name=§a§lIncreasing the Capacity
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAww.desc=To unleash the full potential of your reactor, you have to attach six reactor chambers to it.

# Quest: Move the Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxA.name=§a§lMove the Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxA.desc=Reactors heat up, so you need to "move the heat away" to somewhere else. Either read a wiki and try to comprehend how these work, or give up and just use the versions on the wiki.

# Quest: Venting Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxQ.name=§a§lVenting Heat
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxQ.desc=You can't just move the heat around, eventually you need to get rid of it. Just like the exchangers, there are different types of vents, each of them has a certain usage. Same as the other quest, either read a wiki and try to comprehend how these work, or give up and just use the versions on the wiki.

# Quest: Draconic Evolution
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABhA.name=§6§lDraconic Evolution
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABhA.desc=You have tinkered long and hard to try to combine magic and technology. It looks like you finally found a way! Combining your powers as a thaumaturge and blood mage with your UHV technology you think you have found a way to distill the power of a dragon into a small core. This machine can do it, you are sure. If only you know how precisely to assembler such a core.%n%n%n§3Use a hologram projector to see how it is built. You can also upgrade your draconic cores but for that you need the higher tier schematics and you need to upgrade the multiblock.

# Quest: Shields UP
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABvg.name=§1§lShields UP
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABvg.desc=With a sword in one hand, what can you do with the other? Right, you need a shield. Let's make one.

# Quest: Shield Update
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwA.name=§1§lShield Update
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwA.desc=Your wooden shield is very weak. So you should make a better one. Looks like you need some leather, so go and find some cows.

# Quest: Your First 'Long Range' Weapon
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwg.name=§1§lYour First 'Long Range' Weapon
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwg.desc=You can't make a vanilla bow or Tinkers weapons yet, but you can make a spear!%n%nSome monsters will become much easier to kill with this long-range weapon.

# Quest: Making a Better Sword
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB2Q.name=§2§lMaking a Better Sword
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB2Q.desc=Now it's time to make your first tinkers sword. First you have to make a blade, a type of guard, and tool rod cast forms. Melt some bronze in the smeltery and cast your tool parts. Tadaa... your first tinkers sword. There are 4 types of guard, changing them gets you a different sword type, see the tinker's book for details.

# Quest: Exploding Fluids For Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFA.name=§5§lExploding Fluids For Power
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFA.desc=The Combustion Generator produces EU from several fluids and spends fuel only when necessary. Some fluids are more popular than others, but the Oil processing line has a different combustion fluid in every tier from LV to EV, and all of them are burned in these generators.%n%nTo start, LV is the tier of Light Fuel. It is worth much more than the Oil itself for generating power, so you should distill and dessulfurize the Oil to get clean Light Fuel and use it for power. It's a great way to run your base, and can be upgraded further in the next tiers. Check the "Working with Oil" tab for more information, once you've made a Pump and found some Oil.%n%nIf you're dealing with Oil processing, this is the type of generator you'll use the most.§r

# Quest: Hydrogen, Methane or Some Farts... (Natural gas) 
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFQ.name=§4§5§lHydrogen, Methane or Some Farts... (Natural gas) 
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACFQ.desc=Some centrifugal processes leave gases behind like Hydrogen or Methane. Centrifuge some Brown and Yellow Limonite to get Hydrogen or dump your unused food in a Centrifuge to get Methane gas. Wood will even give 60 mb per log, and many other crops will also generate Methane this way.%n%nThe main powergen line that uses this generator is Benzene, but that needs MV tier.%n%nIf you're dealing with fully renewable powergen, this is the type of generator you'll use the most.

# Quest: Hello Baron, How's Your Black Gold Today?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIg.name=§5§lHello Baron, How's Your Black Gold Today?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIg.desc=During your travels you may have seen some huge oil spouts. Now's the time to make a pump and go collect this black gold into tanks. Oil can be burned directly in a combustion generator (onsite to power the pump, perhaps?) or be refined for better fuels and crafting materials. %n%nBring a generator or battery buffer (with full batteries obviously) with you to power the pump. Thanks to the advancement of technology the pump can auto output on top. Stacking multiple pumps makes them work faster. In that case, oil has to be removed from the bottom of the stack using a pump cover or other means like a conduit.%n%nTaller spouts have more oil. But for the LV pump, it's better to use the short spouts if possible since it doesn't have enough range to fully collect the larger ones in the horizontal range. Save the taller spouts for MV or HV pumps.%n%nMining pipes are needed for pumping the oil, same as the auto miner. When it hits the bottom (or something in the way), if there's no fluid left to collect, it will start retracting the pipes. Same thing if you disable it with a soft mallet. You can also change the range with a screwdriver if there's a reason to do that, like collecting lava in a limited area faster.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on all sides. And set a waypoint with JourneyMaps so you don't forget where you placed it!%n%n§3Once you run out of surface oil, you'll want to turn to:%n1) Oilsands ore, though this is better suited for making heavy oil%n2) Making oil from logs in a pyrolyze oven%n4) Bacterial Vat (EV+)%n5) Crops%n6) Bees%n7) Underground (UG) oil. Dimensions generally have a couple fluids that can be accessed with a multiblock version of the pump, available in MV+%n%nHeavy oil cannot be used until MV for anything except lubricant and burning in semifluid generator since it requires MV distillery

# Quest: Working Table 2.0
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQA.name=Working Table 2.0
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQA.desc=A manual crafting table which remembers the last nine used recipes. Left click one of the recipes shown in the right-hand side to automatically fill in the crafting grid. Right-click to lock a memorized recipe and prevent a newer recipe from bumping it off.%n%nResources need to go into the internal inventory. The crafting matrix is only a visual representation.%n%nThe Forestry worktable is super-useful, and can reduce the tedium of many common jobs because you can click-drag across a row of items, and it will use tools in its own inventory to continue crafting.%n%nSpecifically:%nMaking <Item X> with <Bucket of Y> - Put all the ingredients into the table, and if the recipe is selected, shift click the result to craft them all at once (until you run out)%nMaking fresh water for Pam's - Same as above, but no second item%nMaking clay bricks - The wooden form is automatically reused%nMaking anything that uses a tool - Also automatically reused, while consuming durability%n%n§3For more forestry quests you need to go to the dedicated tab.

# Quest: Moron's Manual to Fecund Farms
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzg.name=Moron's Manual to Fecund Farms
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzg.desc=If you ever wanted to know how crop breeding works, you are in the right place! Get some Crops - the sticks, that is - and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. %n%nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdWdFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd %nFFFdddFFF%nNow place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.%n%nWhen they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks once more on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.%n%nWith some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.%n%nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.%n%nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds. %n%nIf you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.%n%nNote that the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.%n%nDon't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing. %n%nCrossing happens when two or more almost-mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a high chance of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation. For more details, check out the IC2 cropnalyzer quest.

# Quest: Your First Bow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADXg.name=§2§lYour First Bow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADXg.desc=Since vanilla bows are only craftable in the assembling machine and mobs don't drop them very often you should make a Tinkers bow.%n%nWood would be the best material for now. Craft the bow limbs out of wood and the bow string out of strings. The arrow that has the most durability is bone, so craft the stick out of bone. It is much lighter but less durable than a regular arrow. Use a flint tip to make it repairable with flint.%n%nYou can repair your bow the same way as all the other Tinkers tools. The arrows can be regained by repairing them or picking them up from the floor. The arrows should be in your inventory if you want to pick up the ones you fired. You can't pick them up if they are in Battlegear slots.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADYA.name=§2§lYour First Flint Throwing Knife
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADYA.desc=Is the bone bow too expensive for your taste? Then make a flint throwing knife instead. You need flint and a stick to get 12 knives. The durability and the attack damage are very low but it still helps with killing mobs from a safe distance.%n%nThe knives should be in your inventory if you want to pick up the ones you fired. You can't pick them up if the knives are in Battlegear slots.

# Quest: Power of the Sun
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADpQ.name=§6§lPower of the Sun
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADpQ.desc=Now it's time to invest in some renewable energy. Let's start with solar panels. The basic one only gives 1 EU/t. Most GT machines can use them as covers, and receive power, but only so long as it can see the sun (the top). Be sure to put a glass layer above them in case it rains while you swap panels. You'll still want to keep rain off the sides of the machine hull too.%n%n§3The Aluminium Iron plate needs an MV Forming Press.

# Quest: Moron's Guide to Better Trees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWw.name=Moron's Guide to Better Trees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWw.desc=Forestry trees have a variety of attributes.  Once you get a tree with a useful attribute, you can breed that attribute into other tree species. This way you can get an ultimate tree that combines all the attributes you want - including the type of fruit! you can also extract the genes with Gendustry if you can make the machines.%n%n§4Please do your Forestry tree-breeding indoors or underground because butterflies cause lag.§r%n%nKeep in mind that for quests, you will need to breed the species "pure", not a hybrid. You should probably save the crossbreeding until after you get all the good ones.%n%nFor faster tree breeding, enclose your trees so that butterflies cannot escape, and breed bees with better traits for area and pollination speed. There's also frames too if you can afford it. The sieve may also help if you want to do it more exactly if you can make an alveary. You need either bees or butterflies, trees won't pollinate each other. §r%n%nTrees have the following characteristics:%n§eSaplings/Fertility§r: chance of getting a sapling from a destroyed leaf. Good for making into biomass or other uses. Balsa, Gooseberry and Sweetgum are what you want.%n%nAllele     Drop Chance%nLowest   1%%%nLower    2.5%%%nLow       3.5%%%nAverage 5%%%nHigh      10%%%n%n§cMaturation/Matures§r: the growth speed of a sapling into a tree.

Wider trees have more leaves and logs, but will also need more saplings to begin growing. All saplings must be the same species and girth. The sapling in the NW corner determines the stats of the new tree, and is where bone meal must be applied to mature the tree. The Giant Sequoia is best here too.%n%nAllele/Size%n1x1%n2x2%n3x3%n4x4 %n%nYield: chances of getting a fruit from a destroyed leaf.

All other trees just need light to grow.%n%n§3Territory/Soil§r: all trees have Average, whatever that means. Probably something related to the below that never really got used.%n%n§eTolerates§r: if it can be planted on sand or not. Only Desert Acacia and Grandidier's Baobab have this. The trait is either Plains or Plains, Desert.%n%n§5Supports§r: what kind of fruits it can theoretically have. Determined by Species. Only fruits from families listed under this trait can be produced by the tree, regardless of what appears under the tree's Fruits trait. There is a number of trees from the Extra Trees mod that support all 4 types, but none from Forestry itself.%n%n§aFruit§r: determines what fruit or nut it produces. Each fruit/nut provides different advantages:%nPlum and Cherry Plum only produces 100L Fruit Juice, but have a 60%% chance of producing Mulch in the Fluid Extractor or Squeezer.%nPapaya produces 600L Fruit Juice, but only has a 10%% chance to produce Mulch.%nCoconuts produce 300L Seed Oil, but only have a 25%% chance to produce Mulch.%nUse a Forestry Multifarm so you don't have to break the leaf block to get the fruit/nut. Set it to Manual Orchard, and place everything first.%n%n§bFamily§r: Tells you what family of the fruit listed under the Fruits trait is: Pomes, Prunes, Nuts or Jungle.

# Quest: Kinetic Power HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcQ.name=§9§lKinetic Power HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcQ.desc=The Kinetic Generator will transform mechanical energy into electricity. The EU output depends on the KU input. It is most commonly used together with a Kinetic Wind Generator or Kinetic Water Generator. The Kinetic Steam Generator only has one tier, so your should probably use a Steam Turbine instead.%n%nWhen placing a kinetic generator, any time, the "input" side is the side facing you.  So you will place the kinetic generator, then the wind/water/steam gen, and then place a rotor inside. Power can be drawn from any side of the kinetic generator, up to the rated amount per side. %n%nWARNING: Breaking a kinetic generator improperly will not return the generator.  Use a GT wrench, and right-CLICK it.  It should drop immediately.  Try again if it just changed directions. 

# Quest: Kinetic Wind Power HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcg.name=§9§lKinetic Wind Power HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcg.desc=The Kinetic Wind Generator generates energy from wind power which varies randomly, although certain factors can change this.%n%nUnlike the Windmill, the Kinetic Wind Generator will require maintenance in the form of Rotors. These are needed to run the Kinetic Wind Generator.%nOnce a Rotor is placed inside the GUI, the block is given sufficient space, and the current wind level is adequate for the current rotor, the Kinetic Wind Generator will begin to generate Kinetic Energy. %n%nThis can be converted into EU by using a Kinetic Generator attached to the correct face (the black circle).%n%nAbout Wind%nFirst off, the wind strength of a particular area is affected by 3 factors: Height, Weather, and Chance. The higher up in the world you are, the higher the wind level. Below y64, there is never enough wind to be used, and KWG's will not function at all. Weather will also give boosts; Rainy weather will give a 20%% boost to normal wind levels, and stormy weather will give a 50%% boost. The final factor of chance makes the wind strength vary randomly, however there is a limited range of variation.%n%nThe easiest way to check the current wind level in an area is by using a Windmeter. Wind is strongest at around Y160, towards the build limit of Y255 there is very little wind, hence no point attempting to run Windmills that high. While inconvenient, the Wind Generator can run anywhere.

# Quest: Kinetic Water Power HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcw.name=§9§lKinetic Water Power HV
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcw.desc=The Kinetic Water Generator allows Kinetic Units to be produced via the movement of water in river and ocean biomes. As with the Kinetic Wind Generator, it requires either Gearbox Rotor. Search NEI for appropriate options.%n%nIf the Kinetic Water Generator's Rotor isn't entirely submerged in water, it will alert you there is "no room for the rotor". If the Kinetic Water Generator isn't placed in a river, ocean or deep ocean biome, it will alert you it "must be placed in a river or ocean biome". Check the Game Mechanics spreadsheet on Discord for a list of biomes and their tags.%n%nWhile inconvenient, the Water Generator runs more consistently.%n%n§4You can use Witchery (for example) to convert biomes.

# Quest: Rotor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEdA.name=§c§9§lRotor
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEdA.desc=The Kinetic Wind and Water Generators need Gearbox Rotors to function. They can be added and removed with standard automation. Higher tier rotors will last longer. In addition, the iridium ones don't break. The IC2 ones might bug out for durability loss though. Energetic is probably the best for now, since it can give out a full amp, and more is wasted.%n%n§3You only need to make one rotor to complete this quest.

# Quest: Wind Meter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEdQ.name=§9§lWind Meter
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEdQ.desc=The Windmeter measures wind strength. It shows you on which height you can place your Wind Generator.

# Quest: Sending the Power Back
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEeQ.name=§9§lSending the Power Back
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEeQ.desc=Kinetic generator compatibility has been improved so that you no longer need transformers, you can connect directly with a cable. But why not use your transformer to send the power back to base more efficiently, it's a loss of about 57/512EU per A just going from 160 straight down to 63 without it. If you transform up (after going through 1 block of cable to transform it to GT power), you only lose about 57/2048EU per A, much better.%n%n§4IC2 machines don't care about rain, but remember to cover your transformer.

# Quest: GT6-Styled Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEeg.name=§2§lGT6-Styled Pipes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEeg.desc=Wondering why new pipes don't always auto-connect? This was changed to make the pipes smarter. You can now use a wrench to connect only the pipes you want. You don't need a plate or a foil to prevent pipes from connecting anymore. The pipes will still autoconnect if you build one onto the other.%n%nPipes transferring anything hotter than a certain amount, like steam, will cause damage to a player touching them. You might want to cover hot pipes to prevent getting hurt. Also, if the heat level is higher than the pipe's heat capacity, it will melt.%n%nPressing RMB on a pipe in the center of the 'grid' will enable or disable a connection. It will have an X through it if the connection is enabled. You can do the same to any of the 4 corners to adjust the opposite side. You can similarly connect each of the 4 sides by clicking on the closest box in the grid.%n%nPipes have a free built-in shutter to reduce sloshing. Shift-RMB with a wrench on the side you want prevent input.%n%nPipes attempt to transfer half of their capacity twice per second, so the full capacity per second in total.%n%nLarge or Huge fluid pipes can be a poor man's storage tank, holding large amounts on their own.%n%nFor machine outputs, including the boilers and Railcraft water tanks - the one made of Water Tank Siding - you will not need pumps. Other tanks will need pumps or Tinker's Construct faucets to move fluids.%n%nYou can put covers such as GT oak planks or plates on a pipe as well. Normally this prevents connections in that direction, but you can use a screwdriver to enable connections. This lets you make pipes that look nice going through walls. Use a crowbar to remove covers.

# Quest: Fiery Bowstring
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgA.name=§5§lFiery Bowstring
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgA.desc=Why not upgrade your bowstring too? You got some from the last quest, but will need to find some more in the Nether by killing spiders. Craft some fiery bowstring with it.

# Quest: Ardite Crossbow Body
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgQ.name=§5§lArdite Crossbow Body
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgQ.desc=To make your crossbow even better, craft an ardite crossbow body. You received a few ardite ingots as reward before but will need to find ore in the Nether and process it in an Electric Blast Furnace.%n%nWith redstone you can make your bow faster. This requires a free modifier slot on your crossbow.%n%nDon't bother putting Nether Quartz on the crossbow, it only improves damage from whacking mobs over the head with it. Put the Nether Quartz on your bolts instead.

# Quest: Magnalium Crossbow Bolts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgg.name=§5§lMagnalium Crossbow Bolts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgg.desc=Magnalium bolts are much better than your old wooden bolts.%n%nYou can use nether quartz on the bolts to make them even better. This requires a free modifier slot.%n%nExperiment with NEI to find other good bolt materials. %n%nTo make these bolts, you must use a Fluid Solidifer instead of the Tinker's casting table. It's important that you get the molten iron out of the smeltery and into the Fluid Solidifier, the GT molten iron won't work.%n%nThe bolts should be in your inventory if you want to pick up the ones you fired. You can't pick them up if the bolts are in Battlegear slots.

# Quest: Wooden Bolts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEhA.name=§3§lWooden Bolts
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEhA.desc=Your crossbow need some ammo to shoot with. Let's craft some wooden bolts. For now, you can put either iron, alumite, or steel on the tip of your bolts using the Smeltery. For higher tier bolts and tips you will need to pump metals into a Fluid Solidifier with the correct tool rod inserted.%n%n§4For upgrades%n§3Nether Quartz - More damage%nMoss - Self-Repair (unlock in GTNH Thaumcraft tab)

# Quest: Making Power With Your Plasma
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsA.name=§d§l§f§c§lMaking Power With Your Plasma
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsA.desc=Now that you have a reactor, it's time to utilize it to create power. %n%nThe simplest plasma you can make for power is Helium plasma, but it also provides a lot of power. Deuterium is renewable from water, and you can get Helium-3 from Endstone.%n%nHowever, you will need a way to convert the plasma into EU. To do this you will need a large plasma turbine. This will also need a dynamo hatch that can handle the power you're outputting. For Helium plasma, you will want a LuV Buffered Dynamo or above.

# Quest: Turbine Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsQ.name=§a§b§c§d§e§f§d§l§l§c§lTurbine Time
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEsQ.desc=Your fancy new Large Plasma Turbine will need a rotor to go inside of it. %n%nYou can make it out of any GT material, but the best right now is NORMAL Draconium. §4Always test in Creative first!§r%n%nWhen using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Plasma Turbines being the best at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 250%% of optimal flow to produce 158%% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 400%% of optimal flow to produce 214%% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 550%% of optimal flow to produce 301%% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.%n%nThe choice is yours!%n%n§3For a lot of extra information on fusion, check out the new quest line called Powerful Nuclear Physics.

# Quest: Light It Up!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFWg.name=Light It Up!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFWg.desc=The arcane lamp creates additional light sources which acts like a Torch in a sphere with a radius of 16 blocks centered on it. This will include caves or other areas behind walls. That might be useful... One downside, it might put a light where one isn't wanted, like inside an EBF. %n%nWhen attached to the base of an arcane bore, the arcane lamp gains an additional ability: It will light up the tunnel that the bore digs.

# Quest: Mallard Rust Smelly
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFiA.name=§b§lMallard Rust Smelly
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFiA.desc=Or is it Alloy Blast Smelter? Well, that makes more sense. This multiblock creates the higher tier alloys needed for the more advanced GT++ multiblocks and your soldering needs. It directly smelts ingredients into liquids. You can even melt down metals like Tungsten faster too! Until you get better coils for your EBF at least.%n%n§3Can only have one energy hatch.%n%nThe GT++ multiblocks you can now make are optional, but quite powerful upgrades to your current singleblock setups. Not only do they provide more speed, they also have a bit of advanced functionality: you can also electrolyze materials without using cells or use a single multiblock for many different extruder shapes. They also act as cleanrooms where needed.

# Quest: Cough Cough - Something Needs to Be Done About the Smell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFiQ.name=§6§lCough Cough - Something Needs to Be Done About the Smell
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFiQ.desc=Birds falling out of the sky, fish dead and floating belly up in the rivers, acid rain melting the ground...Time to start picking up the trash and cleaning up the air. Small black steel turbines should be fine for now. You'll need two amps of steady power to keep the scrubber working.%n%nThe detector's setting can be changed by clicking on the +/- texture with a screwdriver. Also, in general, better (and larger) turbines work better at cleaning up pollution. The code is too complex to fully explain here, but that's basically it. More EU turbine = more pollution cleaning turbine.%n%n§4This quest covers one method of combating pollution - there are others, including not making as much to begin with.

# Quest: Launch Controller
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFrA.name=Launch Controller
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFrA.desc=The Launch Controller has been modified in GTNH to provide additional functionality. If you launch from a Launch Pad with the Launch Controller set up, the countdown will be greatly reduced, and you will teleport directly to the receiving Launch Pad. It will use half the rocket's fuel up though. This is very useful on laggy servers and can act as an early teleport option if you don't like the magical solutions. You will need to set up a Rocket Launch Pad with Launch Controller and possibly a Fuel Loader on either side.%n%nIf you don't to use it for yourself, you can also try to use it for the Cargo Rocket. To use those at full capacity it is necessary to equip a Rocket Launch Pad, to send items, with:%n%nFuel Loader%nLaunch Controller%nCargo Loader%nAnd the receiving side with:%n%nFuel Loader%nLaunch Controller%nCargo Unloader%n%nIt is also possible to use Buildcraft pipes to transfer items into the Cargo loaders. Next step is to set up the Frequencies in both Launch Controllers (i.e. Set: A to target B, B to target A). Have a look at Launch Controller to setup the automated launch. The first time you have to right-click the Cargo rocket and press launch at the top right corner.

# Quest: Arc Lamp
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFuA.name=Arc Lamp
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFuA.desc=The Arc Lamp is a very bright lamp. It is directional - meaning the light it casts is brighter in the direction it is facing. Its facing can be rotated using a standard Wrench.%n%nIncluding the Arc Lamp the brightness of blocks which are close to light sources is:%n%nRedstone Torch: 3-6%nTorch: 9-12%nBlock of Glowstone: 10-13%nArc Lamp: 13-14%n%nThe Arc Lamp can light up a fairly large area - for example a whole room - at light level 14: it is almost as bright as full sunlight.%n%nThe Arc Lamp also has the interesting property of actively repelling mobs. Not only does its light prevent mobs from spawning nearby, but it is so bright that if a mob comes close to the Arc Lamp the mob will turn around and walk away again. This mob-repellant effect is confirmed to work on: Zombies, Skeletons, Creepers, Evolved Zombies, Evolved Skeletons, Evolved Creepers. It may also work on other types of mobs (confirmation required). But it has no effect on Spiders (they are not afraid of sunlight either) or boss mobs.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFzQ.desc=A Carbon crossbow limb is 1/3 the durability of the magnalium limb, but hits a lot harder and shoots a little faster. But you'll want to carry around a tinker table and extra ingots to repair it constantly, and watch that you don't break it in the middle of combat!

# Quest: All Alone in the Night
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF1w.name=§1§lAll Alone in the Night
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF1w.desc=If you are playing single player (SP), updating the pack means having to reload the questbook. %n%nUse the Default Load Block to do it for you without switching to creative mode - you don't lose progress, but you might have new quests to complete! Use the items to craft it, then place it and right-click.%n%nSorry, no rewards, other than the satisfaction of knowing it's you versus the world.%n%nThis block does the same as the command /bq_admin default load.

# Quest: How the Heck Do I Find Ores?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF2A.name=§2§lHow the Heck Do I Find Ores?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF2A.desc=GregTech ore generation is based on veins. Veins have a fixed height and a rectangular base.%n%nThere is a vein every 3 chunks in x and z direction. The veins typically extend into the neighboring chunks and have varying forms. The center point however is very regular. It is based on the chunk number. Look at upper left of the screen to find the chunk number. This info is displayed by InGame Info XML mod. For now, you need to see chunk info like "Chunk X: 3 Z: -2".%n%nThe 3,-2 is the chunk's address. The orecenters are located at chunk numbers of the form 3N+1 for both x and z. So, 4,7 is an orecenter, as well as 10,16, -23,19, and so on. If you are in the right spot InGame Info will also say that "This is an ore chunk.".%n%nAnother useful tool is the NEI ore vein overlay which you activate by pressing F9 three times. It shows the 3x3 areas and marks the center blue.%n%nThe generation of Ore Chunks is not related to biomes.%n%nFor reading all the way, here's some iron.

# Quest: Digging Deeper
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF2Q.name=§2§lDigging Deeper
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF2Q.desc=Now that you know what an Ore Chunk is, dig all the way down to bedrock to find if there is a vein located in it.%n%nCheck out an ore in NEI to see where you can find a vein that contains it. Search for it and click on it to get this info, among other things.%n%nThere are many types of ores, even just for getting one material like Iron, so don't stick to only one ore.%n%nYou can also search small ores in NEI, but not all of them are used.

# Quest: Better Questing?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF3A.name=§1§lBetter Questing?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF3A.desc=Better Questing has a number of useful commands for the questbook (QB). You need to have cheats enabled to use them. %n%n/bq_admin default load§r%nUse this command to update your QB after you update the modpack. It reloads the quest database from the file. Your save file stores a version of the QB that can be different from the one in the file.%n%n/bq_admin edit%nToggles editing quests. Pressing RMB on the quest will open a context menu to share it or copy its ID.%n%n/bq_admin reset all <Player>§r%nResets all quests. Use this if you want to start over, or are editing the QB. You should specify the player as well if it is a server, otherwise you can skip that part.%n%n/bq_admin reset <ID> <Player>§r%nResets a specific quest, defined by the quest ID. Sometimes it may be easier to go into Edit Mode > Designer Tool to specify what to reset.%n%n/bq_admin complete <number> <Player>§r%nCompletes a specific quest, similarly to the above. You can still claim the rewards. Use this command if a quest is broken, and then report it on GitHub§r, but please check if it's already reported.%n%n/bq_admin default save§r%nSaves changes to the QB after editing it.%n%n/bq_copyquests <PlayerWithQuestsCompleted> <NewPlayer>§r%nIf you want to sync the quests with someone in your party, then use this. They won't get any rewards for that though.%n%n/bq_admin hardcore§r%nEnables BQ3 Hardcore Mode. You only start with 3 lives, so best of luck. Additional life hearts are available in the Kill all the Things tab.%n%nAside from the consume-type quests, a quest counts for everyone in the party if one person finished it. However, if someone joined your party later, you need to get them up to speed first either through /bq_copyquests above, or manually. Otherwise, your quest completion won't count for them because the requirements for that quest are not fulfilled for them.%n%nIf your singleplayer world does not have cheats enabled, go to the ESC screen, open to LAN, then enable cheats. This makes pausing impossible until you reload afterwards. If you host a server, you can run the commands in the command line, without "/". You can also edit the level.dat file, and set 'allowCommands' to 1, but make sure to backup your world before doing that.%n%n§4For quests to save properly, you must be online and logged into your Mojang account when starting the game. Sorry, it's a limitation of Better Questing.§r

# Quest: Backup Your Stuff...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF3Q.name=§1§lBackup Your Stuff...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF3Q.desc=The mod AromaBackup (AB) is included in the pack to backup your world. %nYou can adjust save path, frequency, and the number of backups to keep in its settings at 'config\aroma1997'. %nYou can also use another mod like ServerUtilities, or even an external program. %nDon't use several backup mods at once - it will just waste your CPU power and storage space.%n%nIf you need to restore from a backup, the ones from AB are found in the backups folder in the instance directory, not the world save directory.%n%nRemember that the mods JourneyMap and Thaumcraft Node Tracker store information outside of what most solutions back up, so please backup your journeymap and tcnodetracker folders yourself. %n%nThe Thaumcraft data is a little buggy, losing scanned aspect data and Thaumonomicon data, so consider backing it up as well. The file is at 'saves\<worldname>\playerdata\<nameofplayer>.thaum'.%n%nIf you move to another drive or computer, don't forget to migrate all the backed up files, not just the world folder.

# Quest: Nobody Wants an Explosion...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF3w.name=§6§lNobody Wants an Explosion...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF3w.desc=...right? So when building multiblocks, make sure you:%n%n1. Don't cross chunk boundaries with the multiblock.%n%n2. If possible, don't rely on resources coming from outside the chunk. Make sure you source your water locally.%n%nKeep in mind that electric machines don't like getting rain or snow on them. They'll start fires, and those fires have a chance of causing an explosion. This explosion will explode other machines, cascading until your whole base is a hole in the ground. This is one of the reason backups are a thing. Stay safe out there!%n%nIf worse comes to worst, there is logs/Explosion.log that tracks what caused an explosion. However, this file appears to reset on world load.

# Quest: Not Enough Items - Now with Bookmarks!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF4Q.name=§2§lNot Enough Items - Now with Bookmarks!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF4Q.desc=More like too many items! Here are some tips for using NEI.%n%nWhen you have your inventory open, you can type the search terms in the text bar at the bottom. Make sure your GUI size is set correctly, or you won't be able to see it. Double-click the bar to highlight any matching items in your inventory or inventories you're looking at. Handy for searching for a specific ore, as they tend to look the same!%n%nEven better, you can use T to search nearby inventories, which will emit some particles. %n%nWe have also provided the special Y command to look for a machine in the world, in case you've forgotten where you placed that Advanced Circuit Assembler.%n%nWe now have an extra-fancy Bookmark feature! The default key is A, but can be changed in the NEI config window. Bookmarks will be on the left side of the inventory, and you can look up their recipes or uses as normal. To move a bookmark, drag it with Shift+LMB. You can even bookmark entire recipes with Shift+A or recipes with amounts using Ctrl+Shift+A.%n%nPressing O will hide NEI, useful for fancy screenshots.

# Quest: NEI Is More Powerful Than You Imagine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF4g.name=§2§lNEI Is More Powerful Than You Imagine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAF4g.desc=NEI has some really nice advanced features too.%n%nClicking LMB or pressing R on an item shows the recipes to create it. RMB or U show recipes that use the item. Backspace moves you back to the previously browsed recipe. %n%nHold Shift to stop the oredict cycling through items, and to show the oredict entries for the current item under your cursor.%n%nSearch using #oredict to find items that match that oredict; for example, #dyewhite will list all white dyes.%n%nUse * (asterisk) as a wildcard. For example #pipe*bronze will show you bronze pipes of all sizes.%n%nSearch using @mod. to find all items from that mod; for example, @mod.thaumcraft will list all thaumcraft items and blocks. Note that you need the whole name before it works.%n%nYou can even search a subset now with the right text. @mod.thaumcraft->table will search for anything with table in the name, in the mod thaumcraft. %n%n@thaumcraft and @thaumcraft-> will also search for anything from the mod thaumcraft, but only if the name is set correctly on the tooltip of the item. They basically always are though.%n%nIt has even more advanced features than mentioned here, you should check the web for details. Or just play around with the options.

# Quest: Witchery Seeds
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGA.name=Witchery Seeds
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGA.desc=To get Witchery seeds, use a hoe on grass blocks away from water. To open the rest of the questline, you will need to do Thaumcraft quests and research the Witchery tab in the Thaumonomicon.%n%nAccording to legend, when the root of the Mandrake plant is dug up it screams and kills all who hear it. This is only partially true. A fully grown Mandrake may scream causing immense discomfort to those around. This is why it is best to harvest the Mandrake root at night when the plant is more likely to be dormant. The fully grown Mandrake can be harvested to obtain more Mandrake seeds and a Mandrake.%n%nBreaking a fully grown Mandrake plant will either yield Mandrake Root or the Mandrake may awaken and cause all sorts of mischief (and pain to the ears!).%n%nBelladonna seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage belladonna plant. The fully grown belladonna plant can be harvested to obtain more Belladonna seeds and a Belladonna flower.%n%nSnowbell seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage snowbell plant. The fully grown snowbell plant can be harvested to obtain more Snowbell seeds, snowballs and occasionally a Icy Needle.%n%nWater Artichoke seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Water Artichoke plant. The fully grown Water Artichoke plant can be harvested to obtain more Water Artichoke seeds and a Water Artichoke Globe.%n%nWater Artichoke seeds can only be planted on water source blocks.%n%nGarlic is a plantable crop that can be used to make tasty food, and to deal with vampires. It may be planted on tilled farm land, and will grow in five stages. When full grown the plant may be harvested for up to three dropped garlic bulbs. Which may either be replanted, or used in a crafting recipe.%n%nGarlic bulbs can be used to make meaty stew, a particularly nourishing meal. It is also the main ingredient in making a Garlic Garland, a useful tool in warding off vampires. Finally, garlic can be used by witches in a Witches' Cauldron to make a vampire Weakening brew, and by Witch Hunters, to make vampire resistant armor.%n%nWolfsbane seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Wolfsbane plant. The fully grown Wolfsbane plant can be harvested to obtain more Wolfsbane seeds and the Wolfsbane flower.%n

# Quest: Traveller's Shoes Upgrades

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG-g.desc=Your shoes can be equipped with a few modifications like water walk, double jump, lead boots or slimy shoes. Place the shoes in the middle of a Crafting Station.%n%nWater Walk allows you to walk over water.%nDouble Jump allows you to jump while in the air to jump again.%nLead Boots allows you to walk under water, prevents you from swimming, and may cause excessive Blub. Bring along potions of water breathing.%nSlimy Shoes reduces fall damage.%n%nHint:%nAutorepair can be added to the shoes as well.%nEvery Armor part has 3 Slots for modification.

# Quest: Cable Diodes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHQ.name=§5§lCable Diodes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHQ.desc=Sometimes you just need a Diode, either to prevent burning up cables when splitting off a main line, or on a Thermos Server's chunk borders. Make one 4A Diode and get a 2A one for free!

# Quest: Mushroom Biomes? Why Are There So Many?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHKg.name=§1§lMushroom Biomes? Why Are There So Many?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHKg.desc=The GTNH pack is made for the Realistic World Generator (RWG).%n %nIf your setup uses the vanilla-biomes worldgen, you will get huge Mushroom biomes over the map. If you have this problem, please generate a new world with the RWG. %n%nIf you met this problem on a server, put "level-type=rwg" into the server.properties file and generate a new world.

# Quest: Moron's Manual for Massacring Monsters
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMQ.name=§1§lMoron's Manual for Massacring Monsters
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMQ.desc=If you haven't noticed, this world is a true hellscape full of Special Mobs and Infernals around every corner. Unlike in vanilla, a player has to actually stay aware and pay attention to what they are fighting. Here are some tips.%n%nIf an infernal has Vengeance, don't shoot it with your 56-damage crossbow!%n%nA high health infernal with regeneration is hard to kill. Even worse if it is a witch that can also heal herself. In those cases, run like hell, or bring a soul vial to capture it and throw it into Mount Doom. %n%nWatch out for zombies with fishing poles - they can pull you to them. And zombies with a bow and arrow - they can shoot you back!

# Quest: Moron's Manual for Effective EBFing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHPQ.name=§6§lMoron's Manual for Effective EBFing
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHPQ.desc=Welcome to the latest Moron's Manual, Effective EBFing! This manual covers common problems encountered when using the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace.%n%nSetup%nWhen setting up your EBF, make sure to place it a few chunks away from things pollution affects, like farmland. Pollution is nobody's friend!%n%nDuring setup, make sure the center of the EBF is hollow. Sometimes things can sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft light orb!%n%nMake sure your muffler faces §lout§r, not §lin§r. The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those delightful odors!%n%nWhen placing your power hatches, make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF. Especially at LV, those few blocks make a big difference! Every amp of energy traveling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to get longer running time until you get stable power.%n%nOutput hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and inventories placed next to them such as chests or BC tanks. They will also void if they're full, so keep an eye on them!%n%nWhen building multiple EBFs, the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace can share walls. This can save you on input and output hatches too. Not recommended for energy and maintenance hatches!

# Quest: Double the Fun
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHaw.name=§a§lDouble the Fun
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHaw.desc=Need even more power? Why not combine rods? Produces more power (NOT double, it varies per rod type) and more heat (again NOT double) but only uses up one slot. You need more complex designs to handle them, but you were ready for that, right?%n%nSo how about doubling your doubling to double your double (4x)? Quad rods put out even more power and heat, expect all the other rods to work similarly (for the most part).

# Quest: Unfortunately, There's No Depleted Uranium Bullets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHbA.name=§a§lUnfortunately, There's No Depleted Uranium Bullets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHbA.desc=After your rods have finished their cycle they turn into depleted rods. You can then thermal centrifuge them for some materials back. Depending on the rod, you can get different stuff, see NEI or the wiki for details.

# Quest: No Boom Tomorrow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHbg.name=§a§lNo Boom Tomorrow
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHbg.desc=With a nuke, you can cause some real catastrophic damage to your base. You can either place it 20 chunks away, or surround it with blast proof materials.%n%nFused Quartz is no good now, forget about it ok? Instead, use the GTNH approved Plated Reinforced Stone series! Or one of the other options I guess, like Warded Glass. You may need multiple layers depending on your reactor, try it out in creative. Remember you must close in the corners - blasts can slip through the cracks. To get power out, do right angle turns on the wires as blasts go in a straight line.%n%n§3There are 6 of them, use NEI.%n%nOkay, okay, you don't have to forget Fused Quartz, I'll give you some. Maybe you can stop rain with it.

# Quest: A Quicker Way to Get Around
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHhg.name=§2§lA Quicker Way to Get Around
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHhg.desc=Are you ready for a longer trip? With your new lunch box, saddle, lead and of course a horse, we can start a small journey. Be sure to make paths over water, horses don't like going through deep water. If you get unseated in deep water, you can try getting on repeatedly and moving a small distance each time, this may be faster for small rivers. You can also try jumping over the deep parts if it isn't that big.%n%nIf you are playing single player or a local server, horses make a great way to get around. On non-local servers they can cause problems and desync if you have poor internet, or if the server doesn't have good TPS. Like all the official servers.%n%nYou can tie the lead to your horse and the fence to get it to stick around while you investigate something.

# Quest: Circuit Programming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH_w.name=§5§lCircuit Programming
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH_w.desc=Some machines have a very, very large number of recipes. To avoid conflicts, many recipes have programmed circuits to ensure that the correct recipe is used. These programmed circuits are not consumed.%n%nIn this modpack, all singleblock GT machines now come with an icon in the GUI on the bottom-right that represents a ghost circuit. Click it or scroll to choose the number you need. If you do that, you don't have to insert a physical circuit. This is going to be your main option for all single block machines. This option is now also available for input buses of multiblocks, which you will use much later.%n%nThere are a few places throughout the modpack where you still need the physical circuits. You can turn an LV circuit into a programmed circuit in the crafting grid and then program it in various ways:%n%n1) Find a correct crafting recipe with a screwdriver in NEI and use that.%n%n2) Right-click while holding the programmed circuit to open an easy menu. You still need to at least have the screwdriver in your inventory though or it won't work. Eventually you can also make an electric screwdriver.%n%n3) Use the BartWorks Circuit Programmer. It's only available in MV, but it does not use any durability and runs on EU.%n%n4) Use the GT++ Circuit Programmer block. It isn't portable and only available in MV, but it allows for automation.%n%n%nThe tasks in this quest are just the showcase of what programming circuits there are. You can just click the checkmark once you understand how the programmed circuits work.

# Quest: Safety First
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIcQ.name=§3§lSafety First
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIcQ.desc=For those new to GregTech, here are some tips and warnings about electricity. %n%nMachines don't like being out in the rain, and will start fires nearby. Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier causes an explosion. Or several, if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.%n%nSending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a cable does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.%n%nA generator that supplies 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than the full voltage.  For example, macerators processing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run several from a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. Why does that matter? Because there's loss for every amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are better than wires. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.%n%nMost machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding on cables.%n%nSome machines are specifically there to help you deal with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers, and diodes. Check out the quest tab Storing and Transforming EU for more on those.%n%nIf you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV and LV have their own lossless cables). You can use laser hatches much later to send even more. There even are wireless options, but not right now.%n%nA single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.%n%nNote that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ (tier-1) per amp. So 1 EU at LV, 2 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of your power. You have to be careful with losses when making your first EBF later in LV, maybe rather power them directly? Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up over longer distances, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes less of something to worry about.%n%nIf this info isn't enough for you, head on over to §9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Electricity[/url]§r to read more.

# Quest: Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIoQ.name=Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIoQ.desc=First off, don't be scared by the massive amounts of bees you see here once you unlock the breeding trees. There's even more that aren't included and you'll need NEI to find!%n%nHa ha, just kidding - don't panic! The breeding lines unlock bit by bit showing you what you can go for next, mostly from the top to the bottom. The large icons represent particularly powerful bees. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown on the Bee Breeding Tree.%n%nBees have two sets of traits, active and inactive. The active one affects the behaviour of the bee while the inactive one is only relevant for breeding. %n%nA trait can be §4Dominant§r or §9Recessive§r. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the desired traits. You can breed the ones with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. A Field Kit or GT scanner cannot see passive traits, you need a Beealyzer for that. %n%nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee - a bee that has little to no crossbreeding potential but has all the traits you want - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility, and so on. Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.%n%nWhen you are trying to get new species, what you want is a drone - this way you can use your "breeding stock" princess with the drone to get new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poorly crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good to swap traits because they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let them live longer. %n%nOnce you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die, but they can become Ignoble under certain circumstances like using tons of production frames. Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits, and there's a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect them with that.%n%nOnce you get a new species, it will replace either all Active or Inactive traits. If the mutation happens twice at the same bee, it will replace both sets.§r For example, when you get a Cultivated bee, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated. Most effects are useless, so you can disregard them.%n%nAll quests require purebred§r species. Purebred means that the inactive species-trait is the same as the active one.%n%nAll traits can be bred into any bee species, aside from the species itself. Species also determines the preferred temperature and humidity, as well as drops. Species require their preferred temperature and humidity to be in the 'jubilant' state and produce their special drops. You can also mimic this with the alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT with tolerances.%n%nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances or lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However, the excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for a pristine princess to become ignoble.%n%nIt looks complex, because it is! But it's also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIow.desc=There are a couple of basic bees that have good stats you want to breed into your breeding stock.%n%nCave Dwelling - Rocky - This lets you put the bee housing underneath or inside. Handy for putting a chest on top for products.%n%nNocturnal - Rocky - This keeps your bees working all night long, and in the dark.%n%nRain Tolerant - Water - Keep producing even when it is raining.%n%nHigh Fertility - Wintry - For breeding purposes, you want the maximum number of drones produced.%n%nKeep in mind that specialty products from bees require the Jubilant state. %nTo be in this state, a bee needs have its naturally preferred humidity and temperature. Just being able to work due to tolerance traits is not enough.%n%nFor example, a Salt bee needs Warm/Normal climate. Even if it has +- humidity and temp, it will not produce its Salt comb unless it is in a Warm/Normal climate. Use Alveary upgrades to make sure it is in its preferred temp/humidity.

# Quest: Too Much Mercury?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIzQ.name=§6§lToo Much Mercury?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIzQ.desc=After a couple of hours...days...weeks...of processing redstone for chrome you'll have a massive stockpile of Mercury and not know what to do with it. You can store it all in supertanks, but really, how much hypochlorous acid does one need? Instead you can build an Acid Generator and at least get a little power out of it.

# Quest: Obtaining Ender Pearls
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJZA.name=§e§d§c§6§lObtaining Ender Pearls
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJZA.desc=You can hunt endermen the Vanilla way to get a chance at Ender Pearls, you can purchase Endermen spawn eggs, or try your luck in the End. %n%nOr you can get cruel, and stuff one into a smeltery to melt it down into delicious Liquid Ender and cast pearls from it.%n%nYou monster.%n%nSome of the dungeons have Spawner of Enderman, so you can do whatever you want with it.%n%nTo prevent endermen from teleporting, make sure to cover the smeltery so they don't see the sky.%n%nIf you manage to put a regenerating endermen in there, tag it so it doesn't despawn, and make sure your smeltery is not in a claimed chunk on a server.

# Quest: Numbers in the Corner?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJZg.name=§1§lNumbers in the Corner?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJZg.desc=What's with the numbers in the corner? That is an In-Game Info (IGI) mod. Some of the info it gives is useful right away, some of it shines later on in progression.%n%nFor now, the most important thing it does is showing if you are in an ore chunk. Further quests will explain what it means.%n%nIf you want to hide it, type "/igi disable" in the chat. Type "/igi enable" if you want to turn it back on.%n%nThe command "/igi config" opens the configuration window to control its position, scale, and size.%n%nThe command "/xu_tps" from the mod Extra Utilities toggles numbers to measure ticktime in milliseconds and the TPS (Ticks Per Second). TPS is a measure of how well your server is running. The ideal TPS is 20.00 (meaning a ticktime of at most 50.00). If your TPS  is less than 15, things are going to start lagging noticeably. At 10 or less TPS, it is going to be hard to play.%nThe tooltip shows three types of measurement: instantaneous, average, and worst-case. Each one first shows the ticktime and then the TPS in brackets.%n%nIf you need suggestions on solving TPS problems, feel free to ask for help in the GTNH Discord.%n%nWhile GTNH comes with recommended default settings, in particular when it comes to balance, there are many commands and configurations to customize your experience. They range from accessability or debug tools to visual customization all the way to various cheats. You can find a small overview on §9§n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Commands_and_Configurations[/url]§r.

# Quest: Bringing the Biome to You
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJbw.name=Bringing the Biome to You
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJbw.desc=So maybe you can't find a swamp or tropical forest for your crops or bees, or maybe they're too far away so they're inconvenient to get to, or maybe your base is in a colder climate and you have to deal with the howls of direwolves constantly. Instead of packing up all your stuff and moving somewhere else, why not try changing the biome? There are a couple different ways to do so in this modpack:%n%nUse the Arcane Terrestrial Reformer from Witching Gadgets%n-Requires EV Circuits, Tungstensteel, Rocket Tier III%n-Also requires Infusion, Void Metal (sufficient warp), Energized Node for CV, lots of Essentia%n-16 block radius%n-Can only change to a few specific Vanilla or Thaumcraft biomes%n-Kind of slow%n%nUse Ritual of Gaia's Transformation from Blood Magic%n-Requires Void Metal, Infusion, Tungstensteel%n-Requires getting deep into BM (and the warp that come with it)%n-Requires 1,000,000 LP, Master Blood Orb, Tier 4 Altar and Awakened Activation Crystal%n-10 block radius, can be exactly specified with bloodstone bricks (either type)%n-Cannot specify which biome you get, you can only change the temperature/humidity within the 0.0 - 2.0 range and hope%n-Some biomes may be impossible due to limited range and overlap%n-Adjust temperature/humidity with items on 8 plinths around the Master Ritual Stone%n-Need to relog to see changes%n-Very little documentation or explanation%n-Fast%n%nUse the Brew of Shifting Seasons from Witchery%n-Small range, depends on the level of the brew (power, not dispersal extent)%n-Biome can be exactly specified%n-Crafted using the complicated custom brew system%n-Can add different ingredients to change range of the brew%n-At min changes a single block%n-At max has about a 3 block (circular) radius%n-Instant (once you use it)%n%nUse the Rite of Shifting Seasons from Witchery%n-Requires Stainless Steel, Greatwood Scepter or better for the Distillery%n-You have to do a bunch of witchery stuff%n-Not hard once you're done it once%n-Extremely large range, 16/32/48 block (circular) radius%n-Biome can be exactly specified%n-Sometimes fails in specific chunks%n-Very Fast%n%nIf you want to know how to use the Witchery methods, please go to the Look to the edges tab to continue.%n%nPSA: The IC2&Galacticraft Terraformers only change the surface, not the biome itself.

# Quest: Unlimited LP
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJlw.name=Unlimited LP
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJlw.desc=Making this will give you unlimited LP. But you still need blood for crafting, OK? (Look into Cry of the Eternal soul ritual for a way around this)

# Quest: I'll Send Wireless Signals Where I Want, Thank You
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4A.name=I'll Send Wireless Signals Where I Want, Thank You
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4A.desc=This block provides unlimited AE for your network.

# Quest: Wireless 3.0
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ7w.name=Wireless 3.0
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ7w.desc=This upgrade allows unlimited range. You don't even need a Wireless Access Point!%n%n§4Extremely buggy, unfortunately. May randomly disappear, or fall out of the terminal at any time.%n%n§3Many bugs were fixed. Maybe its better now?

# Quest: UV Solar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKGw.name=UV Solar
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKGw.desc=Produces 1A of UV voltage during the day. Useful if you live in a dimension with permanent day (Eg garden).

# Quest: Gods+
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKHw.name=Gods+
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKHw.desc=BTW, it doesn't actually hold more, you can just I/O faster. Make filling it your life goal!

# Quest: Who Needs UV Solars When You Have Magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKJA.name=Who Needs UV Solars When You Have Magic
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKJA.desc=This single block can produce a maximum of 600m eu/t when in aqua form, that's balanced right... right?

# Quest: Transform and...Stay Put Actually
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKqw.name=Transform and...Stay Put Actually
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKqw.desc=Active Transformers will transform power up or down at only a 0.004%% power loss, making using several in a row obsolete, if you can afford it. Unfortunately, it's kinda expensive. On the other hand, you can use it to turn your lasers from your laser hatches, which is probably a better use.%n%nIt doesn't need a Maintenance Hatch, just the I/O Hatches.%n%n§4Be sure to turn off Power Pass if you want to edit your machine and don't want it to explode!

# Quest: This is Not How You Get Into Space
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKyg.name=This is Not How You Get Into Space
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKyg.desc=This produces power out of Rocket Fuels. To see how to make them, look at the Space Race tab. These are specifically GT++ Rocket Fuels, and automating them for powergen in this multi will also provide you with endless fuel for your space travels.%n%nThe math regarding the Rocketdyne is complicated. Looking at the controller's tooltip helps, but the main gist of it is like this: provide Carbon Dioxide and make sure it doesn't run out, choose the EU/t you want to get, calculate the amount of fuel you need for the fuel you will use, and then provide enough Liquid Hydrogen to boost the multi, according to the EU/t value.%n%nYou will always want to have the Rocketdyne boosted, for several reasons. Assuming you have at least a buffered IV Dynamo Hatch, outputting close to the maximum on that hatch will lower the fuel efficiency, but not if it's boosted. Additionally, this multi doesn't consume fuel continuously, but with intervals of 1 second between consuming and not consuming, while generating power all the same. Boosting this consumption results in huge fuel efficiency, combined with the high fuel values of the Rocket Fuels.

# Quest: A Steam Tier Multi? Unpossible!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKzA.name=§4§3§lA Steam Tier Multi? Unpossible!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKzA.desc=It's a larger version of the Steam Macerator. It only works 8 at a time, but is faster. Note that this multi requires §4§lVery Specific§r I/O blocks, don't mess it up.%n%nAs a 3x3 multiblock, it might seem expensive if you're in the Steam age. However, the processing time per ore is so low that you can sustain your beginner's ore processing system with it! The main reason to change off this is the HV Macerator, which unlocks new outputs on top of what you already get.%n%n§3With this quest you have started your journey on GT++ Multiblocks. However, don't get too excited quite yet. Most of them only unlock in EV or later, including a better version of this macerator.%n

# Quest: Machine Interface Fluid I/O
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALKg.name=§5§lMachine Interface Fluid I/O
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALKg.desc=Thanks to the tireless work of the devs, you can now use cells to I/O fluids directly from the interface of GT machines. Just click on the fluid while holding a cell or other fluid container item.%n%nPoints to consider:%n1) Left click to attempt filling/emptying all fluid containers held on cursor.%n2) Right click to attempt filling/emptying one fluid container held on cursor.%n3) All fluid containers that can be used in a standard gt tank (e.g. super tanks or the X voltage tanks) are supported, including but not limited to: water bottles, vanilla buckets, ic2 (universal and normal) cells, volumetric flasks, large fluid cells, pressurized fluid tanks, etc.%n4) Can fill/take less than one cell (1000L or 144L if molten) of fluid if the fluid container supports doing so.%n5) It won't check if it's a valid fluid for the machine/recipe, keep that in mind.%n6) Doesn't work with Crops++ alcohols, feel free to code compatibility for us.%n7) EIO tanks need to be placed and picked up first before they can be used.

# Quest: 「 」
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALSA.name=「 」
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALSA.desc=If you somehow manage to connect to it, you can get a lot of aspect points, but can't become God. You don't disappear though, so it's probably a decent tradeoff.

# Quest: Making a Rapier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUQ.name=§2§lMaking a Rapier
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALUQ.desc=Problems killing the Lich? Can't manage to shoot back his projectiles? No problem, just use a Rapier that ignores armor and the Lich will soon be...re-dead? Un-alive? Whatever happens to something undead once it dies for real.%n%nThe only problem is that the Rapier doesn't do a lot of damage.

# Quest: Here's Some Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqg.name=Here's Some Oil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALqg.desc=§3Here the oil questlines diverge into two tabs - part about getting every possible output is in the LV tab, part about the usefulness of oil is in the Working with Oil tab, this quest is part of the latter.%n%n§rWelcome! This is the questline that shows the path through oil processing towards all the useful items and fluids that can be obtained from it. Working with this black liquid involves a lot of steps that range from LV (Low Voltage), all the way to IV (Insane Voltage), and outputs that are useful at those tiers and beyond. %n%nOil is useful both for generating power, and to automate a lot of chemicals that are important for progression. As you progress, you will be able to get more of it, and get it faster, as well as process it in new ways that improve on the setup that you were using before. It is not a required path for progression in the pack, but it is a very useful one, should you choose to follow it.%n%nThe best way to start working with oil is to extract it from the surface. Oil spouts are visible without having to dig down, and they can be interacted with by using a Pump placed above them, alongside a generator that feeds it some power. You can use some of the Oil to generate this power for now.

# Quest: Faster Crops
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMRg.name=§6§lFaster Crops
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMRg.desc=§WWelcome to my ted talk, today we talk about the §6§lExtreme Industrial Greenhouse.%n§rIt is the most advanced and §l§nLAG FREE§r crop farm that will allow you to supply the amount of tea you need.%nThe machine starts at §5EV§r, but to farm IC2 crops you will need at least §dLuV§r power.%nTo see the structure, place the controller on ground and use a structure hologram to build.%nThe glass tier limits the energy tier until §3UV§r. With §3UV§r glass you can have an energy tier as high as you want.%nShift click with screwdriver to change crop type (IC2/normal), sadly you can't farm both in one machine.%nThere are 3 modes to manage your crops (change with screwdriver):%n%n§lSetup mode (input):%n§rIn this mode you can plant your crops in the machine.%nJust put them in the input bus and enable the machine with a soft mallet.%nAdditionally, you need to insert block that is required for IC2 crop to grow (if any)%nWhen the bus is empty, just disable it and change the mode.%nKeep in mind that there is limited space of slots for your crops depending on the voltage.%nWith normal crops you start with 1 slot and that multiplies by 2 every tier past §5EV§r, every slot can take 64 crops of the same type.%nWith IC2 crops you start with 4 slots and that multiplies by 4 every tier past §dLuV§r, every slot can take only 1 crop.%n%n§lSetup mode (output):%n§rThis mode allows you to move your Greenhouse or upgrade your crops.%nWhen the machine is running in this mode it will output all planted crops in the output bus.%n%n§lNormal operation:%n§rWith normal crops it is a straightforward process. Base processing time is 5 seconds, at the end of operation all crops are grown and the outputs are added to the output bus. Additionally the time is lower every tier past §5EV§r §o(The time is divided by the number of tiers past §6HV§r§o, minimum 1 second. WOW) §r%n%nIC2 crops on the other hand, are not that easy. They are normally simulated, but accelerated 32 times. Process time is 5 seconds. You can check the progress of the growing process with a tricorder.%n%nIf you want to grow your crops even faster, then you can use a fertilizer (up to §l400%% more drops§r !). Machine will take fertilizer from the input busses on start of the operation and will be applied to that operation only. Each fertilizer gives +200%% per crop in normal mode or +10%% in IC2 mode. The bonus is applied evenly on crops. Examples:%nNormal mode, 3 wheat seeds, 1 tea seeds, you insert 1 fertilizer, you will get +150%% wheat drops and +50%% tea drops.%nIC2 mode, 16 melon seed bags, you insert 64 fertilizer, you will get +40%% drops.%n%nAdditionally, all your crops need water to grow. Every single crop drinks 1000L per operation. So for example if you have planted 576 tea seeds at §3UV§r voltage you will need 576000 L per second.%n%n§lLast notes:%n§rThe animation can’t be disabled.%nThe lamps can be inverted.%nThe dirt must be tilled.%nIf you encounter any issue or have any suggestion please open an issue on github and ping §l@kuba6000§r.%nThis MB was created to farm tea because I wanted to.%n

# Quest: UV Power Per Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXQ.name=UV Power Per Turbine
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXQ.desc=Once you progress enough in ZPM to make ZPM Dynamo Hatches, you can increase each turbine's output to 524,288 EU/t. At this number, you'll be a lot less limited by the turbine material, and it's possible to increase the total power output of one Fusion Reactor considerably. You can cover the total Helium Plasma output from one reactor with 3 Plasma Turbines, if you choose the right materials:%n%nLarge High Durability Compound Steel 230%% 202,860 EU/t%nLarge Atomic Separation Catalyst 200%% 399,672 EU/t%nLarge Adamantium 180%% 170,010 EU/t%nLarge Draconium 170%% 214,200 EU/t (durable)%nLarge Ichorium 170%% 342,720 EU/t (very durable)%nLarge Neutronium 160%% 241,920 EU/t (very durable)%n%nThe power output and final efficiency can vary a lot, based on which turbines you're using. Some of them, like Ichorium and Neutronium, last basically forever, while others will need to be replaced from time to time but offer higher efficiency. If you want to get more power per turbine, to reach closer to the dynamo's limit, you can increase the flow of plasma to the turbine, but be careful! You can't go beyond the dynamo's limit, and you will also lose efficiency as you increase the flow amount. More concrete values for efficiency loss can be found in the Plasma Turbine quest in the LuV page.%n%nMake a normal or buffered ZPM dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest: High Temperature Super Breeder
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbg.name=High Temperature Super Breeder
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbg.desc=Have you heard of pebble reactors?%n%nIt's called the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR), and it uses fuel pebbles and consumes power. However, it doesn't really make a lot of power, and doesn't even match the EU/t of THTR, despite being much more expensive. The multiblock structure is basically the same, a huge reactor around 12x12x12 blocks in size, with 500+ casings made with Europium. What it doesn't make in power, it compensates in breeding, however.%n%nFor the unaware, this is expensive. Pebble reactors work by stuffing the reactor absolutely full of pebbles, and then the reaction will keep going for, essentially, forever. In this case, you will have a fully automated source of almost endless Lutetium, Plutonium and other things that will be explained in the following quests, alongside the production of fuel and the processing of outputs. What this means is that this is an expensive multiblock, but it's placed a tier in which this expense is actually reasonable, if there is a need for immense, endless breeding of many outputs.%n%nIf you're on the fence about building this, check the next quests to learn more about the fuel and outputs.%n%nNotes:%n%nHTGR has an internal buffer for fuel and only one input bus is required (any will do), as well as only one output bus (reactor automatically compresses every 64 burned pellets into one ball, so you need 6 slots or more to avoid problems with voiding at full capacity).%n%nReactor requires only 72k out of 720k pebbles to operate, but running at minimum capacity means that you will not get any bonuses, such as lower recipe time and higher amount of pebbles processed per cycle.%n%nThis multi consumes 1A LuV when operating, no matter how many pebbles are inside, but it also generates Hot Coolant as it runs. If you use it to generate power, you will gain more EU than is consumed by the reactor. %n%nIn this reactor, the throughput increases with the amount of pebbles put into it.%n%nBy typing HTGR in NEI, you can see all the items that are related to this multiblock.

# Quest: Two Million Turbines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcw.name=Two Million Turbines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMcw.desc=Hopefully, not more than a handful. The objective here is for each of them to output close to 2 million EU/t.%n%nHow can you get there? Look at the UV Dynamo Hatch's recipe and you have your new objective. When you arrive there, each turbine that is equipped with that impressive block will be able to output up to 2,097,152 EU/t, which again opens you up to new turbine opportunities. Some good choices at this point are as follows:%n%nLarge Cosmic Neutronium 220%% 1,330,560 EU/t%nLarge Awakened Draconium 190%% 478,800 EU/t%nLarge Trinium 180%% 1,452,520 EU/t%n%nAt this point, you might consider building more t1 Fusion Reactors to process other materials. Even if you stop the reactor you're using to generate this plasma, the EU cost of restarting it is less than 1 bucket of plasma, so it's probably not that big of a deal.%n%nMake a normal or buffered UV dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest: Infinite Turbines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMeA.name=Infinite Turbines
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMeA.desc=Some turbine materials are not available for you, either because you don't have the material itself or because the Dynamo Hatch in the turbine cannot handle the power output from plasma. It will be a different story in UHV, when you can once again quadruple the max output of each turbine, and also unlock Infinity as an option for turbines.%n%nLarge Infinity 270%% 4,354,560 EU/t%nLarge Infinity Catalyst 200%% 806,400 EU/t%n%nYes, that's basically it. You can use any material from the previous turbine quests, but when you make the t8 rocket and can mine Infinity Catalyst, these are the two options. Obviously, Infinity is much better, but also much more expensive. If you stick with fusion, you will need several of those to push through the endgame. Remember that you can input plasma beyond the optimal flow, and get more out of each turbine at the cost of fuel efficiency.%n%nMake a normal or buffered UHV dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest: Gas Planets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMiQ.name=Gas Planets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMiQ.desc=You probably also want a good overview of what you can get with your Gas Siphon. So here we go:%n%n%nJupiter§r%n1 Hydrogen - 15000 L/s%n2 Helium - 500 L/s%n3 Nitrogen - 300 L/s%n4 Oxygen - 200 L/s%n%n§oSaturn§r%n1 Hydrogen - 18000 L/s%n2 Helium - 800 L/s%n3 Oxygen - 500 L/s%n4 Liquid Oxygen - 150 L/s%n%n§oUranus§r%n1 Deuterium - 5000 L/s%n2 Neon - 450 L/s%n3 Argon - 250 L/s%n4 Krypton - 100 L/s%n%n§oNeptune§r%n1 Tritium - 3000 L/s%n2 Helium-3 - 500 L/s%n3 Ammonia - 400 L/s%n4 Xenon - 350 L/s

# Quest: Hypogen Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkg.name=§6§lHypogen Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkg.desc=Forged from the blood of an ageless dragon, and melded together by the power of fusion beyond what you thought was the reality. No natural element, or combination of elements, could match up to this glowing orange material, not even the Awakened Draconium you got your hands on before.%n%nWhat truly happened inside that Mk4 Fusion Reactor? What §ois§o§r this material? Its dust pulsates visibly, at different rates depending on the size of the dust itself. Hypogen approaches a state of complete balance as it approaches the block size, and it is obvious to you what needs to be done with it.%n%nIt absorbs and radiates energy without any effort, but it would be stupid to attempt making coils out of this without assistance. Wetware wasn't good enough anymore, and only the most advanced living circuit could withstand the erratic behavior Hypogen demonstrates.%n%nProvides 12601K heat. Almost certainly, this will end up on your DTPF.

# Quest: Eternal Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkw.name=§6§lEternal Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMkw.desc=Beyond spacetime, beyond reality. You have peered into what never existed and brought into a fluid, and then a solid. It has been stabilized, against all odds. When you look at it, you think that you could hold the entire universe in your hand.%n%nIn the past, you were able to combine almost all materials into one, through an Eternal Singularity, an infinitely dense sample of the universe. However, automating this at the scale of the DTPF proved ridiculous, which would have stopped your progress altogether if not for the discovery of the Energized Tesseract. To physically manifest spacetime itself, you first needed to manifest the fourth spatial dimension, and that is what the Tesseract is: a 4-dimensional cube.%n%nCubes! Almost everything around you is made out of cubes. You have only glimpsed at the reality of the 4-dimensional world, but you have successfully used it to condensate spacetime, which can be arbitrarily molded into the complete Eternal mixture, a process that unfortunately cannot be reversed. Needless to say, living circuits will not suffice to maintain an infinitely dense, infinitely stable, multi-dimensional material.%n%nCurrently, the final upgrade with 13501K. This really makes your DTPF shine!

# Quest: PCB Factory
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMyQ.name=PCB Factory
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMyQ.desc=All those boards made in a chemical reactor. It's time to stop that, there must be a more efficient way to make them. After a couple days of research I have found one, a factory designed to print out circuit boards.%n%n§4§5§a§d§r§a§rThe PCB Factory is able to use a wide range of plastics to create circuit boards ready to be used. The printing mechanism overheats when it tries to overclock currently, so I will have to find a way to make that work later. Boards with neurons on them will also take a bit before they can be made, but it won't be hard to achieve.%n%n§T§2Trace size: the trace size represents the lines between components, which are needed to transmit the electrical signals on the circuit. One can make it smaller to slow down the machine, but use less resources, or make it bigger to make it faster, but use more resources.%n%n§1Formulas:%n- 10000/(TraceSize/100) Production%n- RecipeDuration/TraceSize^2 Time%n%n§2Using the GUI, the player can go to the configuration menu. There they can change the trace size or add new parts to the multiblock. One can also change where they are placed around the multiblock.%n%n§3Make sure to set the configuration you want before using the structure lib blueprint for autobuild.

# Quest: Bio Chamber
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMyg.name=Bio Chamber
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMyg.desc=As I got new technologies, I have seen the need to make a chamber where the circuit board can contain neurons for the wetware boards or the upcoming bioware boards.%n%nThe Bio Chamber is a simple upgrade, it doesn't require many resources. Don't know why I didn't make it earlier.%n%n§3It can use any glass.

# Quest: Liquid Cooling Tower
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMyw.name=Liquid Cooling Tower
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMyw.desc=I have started to hit the limit of the multiblock without overclocking it, so I decided to give it a liquid cooler to cool down the mechanism. This will allow it to overclock like every other multi with 2xSpeed 4xEU/t.%n%nI will need to provide some distilled water to its hatch to avoid blockage in the pipes.%n%n§3The Liquid Cooling Tower allows the Multiblock to have 2/4 OC at the cost of 10/s of distilled water when running. The hatch is placed in the center of the Liquid Cooling Tower.

# Quest: PCB Factory Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzA.name=PCB Factory Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzA.desc=With the Nano Forge built, we can upgrade our production of circuit boards for free, but the nanites need a container to hold them. The current casings aren't enough, we need to find an alternative casing.%n%nAfter some research, infinity as a frame and enriched holmium as the protection layer seems to work well. It can be allowed to let through nanites to go into the printer base so that extra material can be directly removed instead of trying to go slower.%n%n§3Allows the player to use the tier 2 recipes with the use of a silver nanite in the input bus.%nThis also unlocks parallels of the PCB Factory with said formula: Log2(x) parallels, where x is the amount of nanites in the input bus.

# Quest: Thermosink Radiator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzQ.name=Thermosink Radiator
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzQ.desc=With the control of spacetime you have achieved and its 0K temperature it would be possible to make an even better cooling unit. A casing able to keep its room temperature very low and nanites which can transfer heat effectively because of their small bodies. This doesn't quite work and some coolant is still needed, but water freezes at those temperatures so super coolant will be our choice.%n%n§3The Thermosink Radiator allows for 4/4 OC making it possible to speed through recipes. It requires 10/s of super coolant in its hatch, its in the same place as the Liquid Cooling Tower.%n%n§4This upgrade is incompatible with its lower tier predecessor.

# Quest: PCB Factory Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzg.name=PCB Factory Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzg.desc=Why use a small nosel to print out the conductor on the board when one can just build it using nanites? Well the silver nanite isn't rigid enough for that so a new nanite will be needed... and so will new casings. Heard that celestial tungsten is a good candidate for a frame. Quantum can be used for the protection as these nanites will be forever flying around inside.%n%nThe structure will need to change as it needs to be a bit bigger and taller.%n%n§3Works the same as the Tier 2 in most cases, but allows the player to use even less resources by using a gold nanite.

# Quest: Nano Forge Tier 1
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzw.name=Nano Forge Tier 1
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMzw.desc=There must a be a way to make a nano scale robots to work in a machine. Carbon ones can be made in an assembly line, but very inefficiently. There must be a better way.%n%nWhat about a Nano Forge, able to cut up blocks into nano-thin sheets and then creating the first nanite, which helps create thousands of them in mere seconds.%n%n§3The Nano Forge is a big multiblock requiring lots of power over the course of a couple minutes. It is able to use TT energy hatches (including lasers). The controller must have a carbon nanite to use tier 1 recipes.%n%nDespite what NEI might claim there are no minimum voltages for the Nano Forge recipes. If you want to do a recipe you just have to achieve the raw EU/t required, no matter the voltage.

# Quest: Nano Forge Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0A.name=Nano Forge Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0A.desc=Carbon Nanites are good first workers, but they don't have much in the way of working with more complex systems as they have a very basic nanite network. So a new more advanced nanite will be needed to produce complex nanites.%n%nThe neutronium nanite is an in-between of the two tiers able to produce tier 2 nanites, which have other uses.%n%n§3When putting the neutronium nanite in the controller, you will need to wait for the structure check to happen again or break and replace the controller with a neutronium nanite inside. Allows the Nano Forge to make tier 2 nanites.

# Quest: Nano Forge Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0Q.name=Nano Forge Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM0Q.desc=Neutronium nanites are slow moving, but that allowed them to have a complex nanite network. If there was a material that could move itself it could allow for an even more complex nanite with great speeds... Thankfully with the DTPF fully functional we can make it, transcendent metal.%n%n§3Same thing as the neutronium nanite, but this nanite allows for tier 3 nanites to be made in the nano forge.

# Quest: Integrated Ore Factory - All in One!
betterquesting.quest.3hN7FykMSJSWSykZiEWvfQ.name=Integrated Ore Factory - All in One!
betterquesting.quest.3hN7FykMSJSWSykZiEWvfQ.desc=The Integrated Ore Factory allows you to process ores through multiple processes at once.
