; To change/remove/add/replace recipes, modify this file and put it in the
; "minecraft/config/ic2" folder. Do NOT modify the file inside of the IC2 jar file.
;
; shaped recipes are defined as follows:
;  <output> = <input set 1>[, <input set n>...]
;
; output:
;  <name>[@<metadata>]
; input set:
;  "<pattern>" <input 1> [<input n>...] [@hidden] [@count:<n>]
; pattern:
;  <index characters row 1>[|<index characters row 2>[|index characters row 3]]
; input:
;  <pattern index character>:<input item>
; input item:
;  <name 1>[@<metadata 1>][|<name n>[@<metadata n>]...]
;
; name references one of the following:
; - the global unique item name as introduced by MC 1.7 (mod id:registry name)
; - an ore dictionary entry with OreDict:<ore dict name>
; - a fluid container item for a fluid with Fluid:<fluid name>
;
; the metadata is specified as follows:
; - not at all -> metadata 0 is required or for ore-dictionary names their original metadata
; - * -> any metadata is allowed, overriding ore-dictionary metadata values to acccept any
; - <some number> -> the specific value is required, overriding ore-dictionary specifications
;
; The hidden attribute will prevent the recipe from being shown by recipe mods,
; unless specified otherwise in the IC2 config.
; The count attribute determines how many items of <output> the recipe will yield.
;
; Line breaks are only allowed with a leading \ character, but never before =.
;
; Note: this is a Output = Input mapping.
