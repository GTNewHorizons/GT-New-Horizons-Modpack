Specifies the spawning behavior of Ender Zoo mobs. 
These settings can be modified, and changes can be made to non Ender Zoo mobs in the SpawnConfig_User.xml file.
This file will be replaced each time Ender Zoo is loaded and is only placed in the config dir as a guide to creating
entries in the user file.

Note that all entries are applied in order. This allows, for example, for existing slime spawns in swamps to be removed in one
entry, and then in the following (using a different ID) they can be added back with different rates / group sizes. 

The basic format for the file is as follows:
<SpawnConfig>

  <entry ...> 1..x
    <biomeFilter ...> 0..x
      <biome/> 1..x
    </biomeFilter>
    <dimensionExclude .../> 0..x
  </entry>

</SpawnConfig>

entry attributes:
- entry.id:
  Used to uniquely identify the entry. If an entry with this id exists in the user file that entry will replace the one in
  the core file.
  
- entry.mobName: The name used to register the mob with Minecraft. 

- entry.creatureType: (Optional, default monster) The type of mob. Values must match the names in EnumCreatureType. Valid entries:
                     monster, creature, ambient, waterCreature

- entry.rate: The rate at which the entities are spawned, for example 10=Enderman spawn rate, 100=Zombie spawn rate

- entry.minGroupSize: (Optional, default 1) the minimum number of mobs to be spawned per group 

- entry.maxGroupSize: (Optional, default 3) the maximum number of mobs to be spawned per group

- entry.remove: (Optional, default false) if true all all existing spawn entries matching this entry will be removed rather than added
                in this case the rate is ignored, but must still be included cause I am lazy

Each entry can include 0 or more biome filters.  To remove an entry from the core file via the user file create an entry with the
same id and no biome filters.


biomeFilter attributes:
- type: The type of filter
  'any': if a biome matches any of biome entries, and does not match any of the excluded entries, the mob will be able to spawn in that biome 
  'all': if a biome matches all of biome entries, and does not match any of the excluded entries, the mob will be able to spawn in that biome


Each filter must contain one or more biome entries

 biome attributes:
 - type: The name of the biome type. There can be many biomes registered for a specific type based on the mods installed
         Any number of biome types can be listed for a filter
         All valid biome types that are listed in BiomeDictionary.Type. The base types are:
         MESA, FOREST, PLAINS, MOUNTAIN, HILLS, SWAMP, SANDY, SNOWY, WASTELAND, BEACH, MUSHROOM, OCEAN, RIVER, NETHER, END 
          
         The special name BASE_LAND_TYPES includes:
         MESA, FOREST, PLAINS, MOUNTAIN, HILLS, SWAMP, SANDY, SNOWY, WASTELAND, BEACH
         
- name: The name of the biome. Must be exactly as registered.
         
- exclude: (Optional, default false) when set to false any biomes matching this type will be excluded. For example, if
            FOREST is specified as a biome type, and CONIFEROUS is specified with the exclude set to true, then the mob will not
            spawn in a forest with coniferous trees (e.g. spruce) will be excluded       
            

Each entry can include 0 or more dimension excludes. This will stop the mob spawning in the specified dimension/s.
Dimension excludes can be defined in three ways: by name, by ID and by ID range            

dimensionExclude attributes:
- name: The name of the dimension, for example: "The End", "Nether", or "Overworld"                       
         <dimensionExclude name="The End"/>
- id: The ID of the dimension to be excluded         
         <dimensionExclude id="1"/>
- idStart: The minimum ID to be excluded
- idEnd: The maximum ID to be excluded.           
         <dimensionExclude idStart="2" idEnd="10"/>
         In this example the mob will not spawn in any dimension with an ID between 2 and 10 inclusive
