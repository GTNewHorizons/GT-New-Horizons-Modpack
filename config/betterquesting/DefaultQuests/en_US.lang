betterquesting.questline.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.desc=The very first tier, tier zero. This chapter will introduce you to the basic mechanics of this modpack. Mods covered: Vanilla, Pam's Harvestcraft.

# Quest: §d§3§2§1§lYour First Night

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.desc=Your first task will be to find food, and a shelter for the night. The nights will be cruel, as this pack has hardcore darkness. It probably would be a good idea to collect some food now...%n%n§lNote: You don't need to keep this book, you can use tilde to open quests without the book.§r ...if your keybinds don't conflict.%n%nGo to the Discord server at §6https://discord.gg/EXshrPV§r for help outside of what the questbook offers, or just to hang out. Select an appropriate role in #role-select to get tier-appropriate advice.%n%nWe also maintain a wiki at §9https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page §rbe sure to check it out. Some of the stuff is really complicated, and needs more text to explain than the QB can do. Also, pictures. Also, beginner's guides for some stuff if you don't think the questbook is enough. There's also a list of optional mods for people that want to be even fancier, or use different fonts or w/e.%n%nAdditionally, there's the spreadsheet at §dhttp://bit.ly/gtnh-datasheets§r for info that you would would want a spreadsheet for.%n%nLastly, if you got the pack from §4Curse§r, please be aware that it doesn't always work properly (Curse doesn't play well with all the customized versions of mods we have), so if you have any problems, the first response on how to fix it will be to switch to another launcher like §9MultiMC§r or §aTechnic§r. The latest version is available on the discord channel from #announcements or with the !download command.%n%n§3Hopefully you didn't get munched by a monster while reading this.

# Quest: §1§lSticks 'n Stones

You can read about quests while you're waiting for the night to be over, but for now, you may want to get the basics done. If it isn't dark already, go out and collect some gravel and wood. Keep in mind that you need food, so look for Pam's Harvestcraft gardens. (And save some of the vegetables for seeds!)%n%n§3If you haven't already, make sure to read the info quests linked from the first quest when you can, they have important info!

# Quest: §1§lMain Quests and Secondary Quests
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004.name=§1§lMain Quests and Secondary Quests
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004.desc=Now that you've made it this far, notice the two new quests. See how these two quests look different? The quest with the jagged edges is a main quest and is linked to other main quests by a thick line. You must complete the main quests to unlock the next tier, or to progress in general. If you can't progress, go back to previous tiers and look for uncompleted main quests. The other quest is an optional quest, and is not needed to unlock new tiers. However, optional quests often introduce you to useful items or processes.%n%nWhat are the coins? You can use them to purchase things in the Coins tab. In case you started in a bad biome, I'll give you enough coins to purchase some saplings.

# Quest: §1§lTools
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000005.name=§1§lTools

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000361.desc=If you're lucky enough you spawned near a sand or rainforest biome and can find some quicksand. Collect a stack of the stuff, dig a small ditch and fill it with the quicksand to protect your "dirt base" home. Just don't fall in!

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000003b2.desc=Maybe you're lucky and started off in a bamboo forest. Bamboo is a very useful tree since it grows really fast and when you break the bottom-most block, the whole thing comes apart. You can use them as sticks, or you can place the bamboo sticks and they will grow and protect your base behind a 3 block tall wall. Alternatively, you can also use Berry Bushes. Well, assuming you don't just make a fence.

# Quest: §1§lYou Reap...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000006.name=§1§lYou Reap...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000006.desc=You won't always get food rewards from this book, so it might be a good idea to take care of that problem. As you've created a hoe already, go and find some water nearby and make a field.  With this modpack you can only make farmland within range of water. Let's trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your own farm.%n%nTo get other wheat, use a hoe on grass away from water. You'll get Witchery seeds too, save those for later. Start planting a cotton field, it's a key early game resource.%n%n§3PS: You can also grab a bunch from villages, and also grow the seeds from Pam's garden food.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001d5.desc=Are you waiting for the carrots to grow? Go and find some berry bushes and berries.

# Quest: §1§l"Baked" Potatoes

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001ba.desc=Eating raw potatoes isn't that healthy, as you might have noticed. Some potatoes are green and poisonous already.

# Quest: §2§1§lFood Variants
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001d7.name=§2§1§lFood Variants
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001d7.desc=Maybe you noticed already that eating the same food too often is very boring and not healthy any more. Some food like tea leaf can be taken to the furnace and processed further. So take a break and drink a cup of tea. Maybe munch some tasty raisins as they are very nice.

# Quest: §1§lSoft Mallet Adventure
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001bc.name=§1§lSoft Mallet Adventure

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000b.desc=It's about time to craft something more useful: A sword!%n%nNow that you have a sword, you will get credit for monster kills in the Kill All the Things tab. Watch out, monsters in this world will chew you up and spit you out!%n%n§3PS: You can find additional weapon quests on the Getting Around Without Dying tab.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000a.desc=It's GLOPPing time! Go kill some pigs to gather meat. (And yes, they will drop cooked porkchops. Now isn't that useful...)

# Quest: §1§lCows Are Supposed to Moo!

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005c3.desc=What the? You noticed that sometimes when you kill something, even a cow or chicken, that it explodes! What madness! To stop it, use a proper GregTech Knife or Butchery Knife to kill them. Craft a flint GregTech knife with a stick and a piece of flint (it's hard to find in NEI, you need to search a bit) and I will give you an old iron one to use once it wears out.

# Quest: §1§lShields UP
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001be.name=§1§lShields UP
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001be.desc=With a sword in one hand, what can you do with the other? Right, you need a shield. Let's make one.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001c0.desc=Your wooden shield is very weak. So you should make a better one. Looks like you need some leather, so go and find some cows.

# Quest: §1§lYour First 'Long Range' Weapon
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001c2.name=§1§lYour First 'Long Range' Weapon
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001c2.desc=Since you can't make a vanilla bow before LV and Tinkers weapons are not available in this Tier, you can make a spear out of sticks, leather and a string. Get one because some infernal monsters are easier to kill with a long range weapon.

# Quest: §1§lMoron's Manual for Massacring Monsters
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000731.name=§1§lMoron's Manual for Massacring Monsters
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000731.desc=If you haven't noticed, this world is a true hellscape full of Special Mobs and Infernals around every corner. Unlike vanilla, a player has to actually stay aware and pay attention to what they are fighting. Here are some tips.%n%nIf an infernal has Vengeance, don't shoot it with your 56 damage crossbow!%n%nA high health infernal with regeneration is hard to kill. Even worse if it is a witch that can also heal itself. In those cases, run like hell, or bring a soul vial to capture it and throw it into Mount Doom. %n%nWatch out for zombies with fishing poles - they can pull you into them. And zombies with a bow and arrow - they can shoot you back!

# Quest: §1§lCreeping Dread
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000732.name=§1§lCreeping Dread
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000732.desc=Creepers can cause the worst problems. %n%nDrowning Creeper - when it explodes, it surrounds you in a ball of cobble filled with water. Not only do you have to escape, but the cobble is infested with silverfish! And those silverfish are all infernal as well.  The best way to deal with it is to first escape up or down.  If you have to clear the cobble ball, first clear the water. Surrounding the cobble with a dirt moat will keep the silverfish inside and unable to hide. Put down punjis, quicksand, or lava, and/or spectral glass. Make a wall with a 1x1 window and use that to break the cobbles - fishing silverfish are especially dangerous.%n%nEnder Creeper - Randomly teleports you a short distance - possibly deep underground.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000734.desc=The only zombie pigman to watch out for is the Vampire Pigman. He hardly takes any damage unless you use a wooden sword as a stake or have a magical sword.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000735.name=§1§lFlaming Idiots

Get awesome weapons, awesome armor, and prepare for a fight. %n%nAlternatively, figure out a way to destroy them with technology.%n%nAlternative to the alternative, figure out another way to get blazepowder and blaze rods.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000d.desc=Sleepy time, and the end of the tutorial. Congratulations, you've built your first hideout, and you should have a steady supply of food by now. See you again in tier 0!

# Quest: §1§lWhat's That...?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000e.name=§1§lWhat's That...?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000e.desc=You've seen a lot of trees, but there are a few that look really special. You are sure that these trees are much more than just wood to build your home with or used to get charcoal. You're sure that these will be Very Important soon™.%n%nThe best place to find them is in a Magical Forest, but if you can't find one you can try a Garden or Cherry Wood Grove. Or just randomly everywhere.%n%n§3If you have trouble finding them, you can go to "Coins, Coins, Coins" tab and buy them.

# Quest: Goals
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000018c.name=Goals
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000018c.desc=GregTech New Horizons is a long and intricate mod pack with massive amounts of custom content and over 3000 quests to guide you along.%n%nWe would generally recommend you only set yourself relatively small goals from tier to tier and see how far your journey takes you. The ultimate late game goal is to craft a Stargate or two. But the recipe is outrageous and only very few players have ever done so. If you need a big goal for your run, maybe aim for a more realistic achievement. Like going to the moon if this is your first time playing. Or making and automating an Assembling Line if you have never done so. Or crafting the Tier 8 Rocket which is the last rocket and is reached in UHV. 

# Quest: Even more challenge needed?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000018d.name=Even more challenge needed?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000018d.desc=You have played through most of the pack a few times already? Maybe you even made a Stargate? Or are you just looking for something a bit different? Don't worry, we have a few options for you:%n%n- Play in Hardcore. Either Minecraft Hardcore, or BetterQuesting Hardcore. The latter is a bit more forgiving. Maybe this seems impossible, but people have indeed reached UEV+ in Minecraft Hardcore. Better be prepared to restart a few times. This is obviously not for everybody.%n%n- Never make a rocket. The so called §ono rocket run§r is pretty well supported by now and you will be able to do almost everything in the pack. Use bees, crops, and blood magic meteors as your main resource production. Be warned though that this challenge is grindy and slow. You might need to collect large amounts of aluminium gravel for example to get your first titanium.%n%n- Skyblock. Yes, really. It is also known as Garden of Grind and it is absolutely brutal. There is no actually supported skyblock version of the pack but some players have figured out the minimal amount of changes needed to make it work. Ask around or search on the offical discord channel for all the details. But don't expect any fun down this road.%n%n- Speedrunning. A few players have designed some basic rules and have started to record speedruns to early game goals like the Coke Oven. Ask around or search on the offical discord channel for all the details. Maybe you just want to watch how they do it.

# Quest: §1§lStaying Cool in the Heat
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000740.name=§1§lStaying Cool in the Heat

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001e4.name=§1§lCan You Hear the Carrots Grow?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001e4.desc=Tired of waiting since your carrots grow sooooo slow?%n%nWell I've got an idea, bone meal will help you grow food in seconds. So, chop down some trees and I will trade you some bone meal.

# Quest: §1§lTell Me When We Reach 20
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000739.name=§1§lTell Me When We Reach 20

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001b8.desc=Oak trees which give apples? Who the hell added this to minecraft? You found a way of combining an oak sapling and an apple to get an apple tree sapling. Try to plant one to get a permanent source of food.%n%nOnce you complete this quest, check out the rest of the Quest Tabs. A new one, "Coins, Coins, Coins", has unlocked. You'll want to look through all the quest tabs to make sure something new hasn't unlocked somewhere else occasionally. There are lots of tabs, so be sure to scroll down!

# Quest: §1§lAll Alone in the Night
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005d7.name=§1§lAll Alone in the Night
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005d7.desc=If you are playing single player, updates mean having to reload the questbook. Use the Default Load Block to do it for you without having to enter creative mode - you don't lose progress, but you'll have new quests to complete!

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b3a.desc=In this, like many packs, you'll want to have things in your base keep running while you're off exploring. §3(Though admittedly once you reach midgame you'll spend almost no time off-base, you'll still want to make sure everything is still chunkloaded just in case to prevent machine explosions, especially for multiblocks)§r%n%nIn order to have things keep running, you need to have the chunks loaded. You can do this in a few ways.%n%n1) Install FTB Utilities and claim chunks, then set them to chunkload. By default you may not be able to claim/chunkload enough per player, so feel free to increase the number. You need to be in SP or running your own server to do this.%n%n2) Use an Anchor from Railcraft. There are 4 types. Anchors are not craftable until LV. In SP, or a server you run, cheat in Admin Anchors to chunkload forever, for free. They're limited on servers to prevent TPS dropping from people chunkloading a base forever when they aren't even there. On the officials, you need to use Ender Fragments, Ender Pearls, or Coins to fuel them. Look at the tooltip on each for how long it will work, and in what chunkloader. Feel free to limit yourself to chunkloading this way in SP if you want to make it more challenging though.%n%n3) Use chicken chunks to get anchor-like blocks. But don't do this, it's buggy.%n%n4) Use Chunkloader from GT++. You need EU instead of Ender Pearls.%n%n5) Use one of the blocks that chunkloads itself. If you do this on a server, expect the admins to possibly get very mad with you if it's not something you're allowed to do. Same for vanilla methods.

# Quest: Moron's Manual to Fecund Farms

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002ce.desc=If you ever wanted to know how crop breeding works you are in the right place. Get some crops (the sticks) and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. %n%nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdWdFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd %nFFFdddFFF%nNow place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.%n%nWhen they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.%n%nWith some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.%n%nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.%n%nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds. %n%nIf you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.%n%nNote that the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.%n%nDon't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing. %n%nCrossing happens when 2 or more almost mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a high chance of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation. More details in the IC2 cropnalyzer quest.

# Quest: Moron's Guide to Better Trees
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000045b.name=Moron's Guide to Better Trees
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000045b.desc=Forestry trees have a variety of attributes.  Once you get a tree with a useful attribute, you can breed that attribute into other tree species. This way you can get an ultimate tree that combines all the attributes you want - including the type of fruit! you can also extract the genes with Gendustry if you can make the machines.%n%nIT IS RECOMMENDED YOU DO YOUR FORESTRY TREE BREEDING IN AN ENCLOSED AREA, OR UNDERGROUND. BUTTERFLIES ARE A KNOWN LAG SOURCE.%n%nFor faster tree breeding, enclose your trees so that butterflies cannot escape, and breed bees with better traits for area and pollination speed. There's also frames too if you can afford it. The sieve may also help if you want to do it more exactly if you can make an alveary. §3PS: You need either bees or butterflies, trees won't pollinate each other. §r%n%n§eSaplings/Fertility§r: Chance of getting a sapling from a detroyed leaf. Good for making into biomass or other uses. Balsa, Gooseberry and Sweetgum are what you want.%n%nAllele     Drop Chance%nLowest   1%%%nLower    2.5%%%nLow       3.5%%%nAverage 5%%%nHigh      10%%%n%n§cMaturation/Matures§r: The growth speed of a sapling into a tree.

Wider trees have more leaves and logs, but will also need more saplings to begin growing. All saplings must be the same species and girth. The sapling in the NW corner determines the stats of the new tree, and is where bone meal must be applied to mature the tree. The Giant Sequoia is best here too.%n%nAllele/Size%n1x1%n2x2%n3x3%n4x4 %n%nYield: Chances of getting a fruit from a destroyed leaf.

All other trees just need light to grow.%n%n§3Territory/Soil§r: All trees have Average, whatever that means. Probably something related to the below that never really got used.%n%n§eTolerates§r: If it can be planted on sand or not. Only Desert Acacia and Grandidier's Baobab have this. The trait is either Plains or Plains, Desert.%n%n§5Supports§r: What kind of fruits it can theoretically have. Determined by Species. Only fruits from families listed under this trait can be produced by the tree, regardless of what appears under the tree's §aFruits§r trait. There's a number of Extra Trees trees that support all 4 types, but none from Forestry itself.%n%n§aFruit§r: Determines what fruit or nut it produces. Each fruit/nut provides different advantages:%nPlum and Cherry Plum only produces 100L Fruit Juice, but have a 60%% chance of producing Mulch in the Fluid Extractor or Squeezer.%nPapaya produces 600L Fruit Juice, but only has a 10%% chance to produce Mulch.%nCoconuts produce 300L Seed Oil, but only have a 25%% chance to produce Mulch.%nUse a forestry Multifarm so you don't have to break the leaf block to get the fruit/nut. Set it to Manual Orchard, and place everything first.%n%n§bFamily§r: Tells you what family of the fruit listed under the Fruits trait is: Pomes, Prunes, Nuts or Jungle.%n%n§4When breeding these trees for quests, you will need to breed the species "pure", not a hybrid. Fortunately, that's much easier for trees. You should probably save the crossbreeding 'till after you get all the good ones.

You can now use a wrench to connect only the pipes you want. You don't need a plate or a foil to prevent pipes from connecting anymore.%n%nPipes transferring anything hotter than a certain amount (like steam) will cause damage to a player touching them. You'll want to cover hot pipes to prevent getting hurt if you want to walk over them. Also, if the heat level is higher than the pipe's heat capacity, it will melt.%n%nRight clicking on a pipe in the center of the 'grid' will enable or disable a connection. It will have an X through it if the connection is enabled. You can do the same to any of the 4 corners to adjust the opposite side. You can similarly connect each of the 4 sides by clicking on the closest box in the grid.%n%nAlso, pipes now come with a shutter built in for free to reduce sloshing. Shift-rightclick with a wrench on the side you want prevent input.%n%nPipes will attempt to transfer 1/2 of the capacity twice per second, so the full capacity per second in total.%n%nLarge or Huge fluid pipes can be a poor man's storage tank, holding large amounts on their own.%n%nFor machine outputs, including the boilers, and RC water tanks (the one made of water tank siding), you will not need pumps. Other tanks will need pumps or Tinker's Construct faucets to move fluids.%n%nYou can put covers such as GT oak planks or plates on a pipe as well. Normally this prevents connections in that direction, but you can use a screwdriver to enable connections. This lets you make pipes that look nice going through walls. Use a crowbar to remove covers.%n%n§3Hint: If you click one pipe onto the other they will auto-connect.

Now, the orecenters are located at 3N+1 chunks.  So, 4,7 is an orecenter. 10,16. -22,19.  Etc. %nProtip: to find out if a number is divisible by 3, add the digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3.  So 86 = 8+6 = 14. So you need to go down 1 chunk or up 2 chunks so that you are on a 3N+1 chunk.%n%nFor reading all the way, I'll give you an ingot of iron.%n%n§6TLDR: There's an ore vein every 3 chunks.

# Quest: §6§lAutomating Power On/Off
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000676.name=§6§lAutomating Power On/Off
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000676.desc=Once you have a GT boiler or Large Combusion Engine with a long startup time, you may wish to automate turning it on/off to save fuel, since extra power or Steam will just be voided. Additionally, the bigger your Steam/EU buffer is, the less time your generators will spend heating up, which makes them more efficient. Use a Machine Controller Cover on the controller (protip: You can put it on the top, bottom, or on the side next to a casing, casings will transmit redstone signal). §3You can use a Soldering Iron and Fine Soldering Alloy Wire to set the Redstone Output of a controller block to strong so it'll go through a casing (only casings, not hatches, busses, etc) to use with an activity detector if you want to receive a signal from the controller rather than turning it on/off with one.§r%n%nWith a Machine Controller Cover, you can use redstone to turn the machine on and off. This is handy if you don't want to use a Soft Hammer to disable a machine yourself constantly.%n %nThe best way to do that is with an RS latch. One input will turn the machine on, and one input will turn the machine off. Use a comparator attached to a valve to measure the steam level in your multiblock Iron or Steel Tank. Invert the signal to turn on your boiler when the steam level is low. When the steam level signal is high, turn your boiler off. Use a trail of redstone to lower the signal strength. Because of boiler/turbine warmup, try to set the ON strength to 30 percent of capacity and OFF strength to about 90 percent.%n%nRed alloy wire will hold a redstone signal for a longer distance than normal redstone, while redstone conduits will go indefinitely. You can also use amplified redcrystal to improve the strength of the signal for a long distance, repeating as necessary. %n%nYou can use a Energy Detector Cover in Normal Electrical Storage (including batteries) mode to monitor the power in a battery buffer and use it to enable/disable generators in a similar way. Change mode using a screwdriver. If you use a dense redcrystal, it will only allow signal through at a certain level, perfect for automating this kind of thing.%n%nYou can use MCCs on more than just generators though, you can use it on any multiblock (and most SBs too). This is useful to prevent voiding of materials. If a non-GT++ multi is full, it'll void the items or liquid (GT++ ones will halt) and keep on truckin', potentially voiding huge amounts of materials. You'll want to use them in combination with Fluid or Item Detection Covers on the output hatch or bus.%n%n§2If you still don't get it, watch moron's video on it at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPfnifJEO64

This manual covers common problems encountered when using the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace.%n%nSetup%nWhen setting up your EBF, make sure to place it a few chunks away from things pollution affects, like farmland. Pollution is nobody's friend!%n%nDuring setup, make sure the center of the EBF is hollow. Sometimes things can sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft light orb!%n%nMake sure your muffler faces §lout§r, not §lin§r. The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those delightful odors!%n%nWhen placing your power hatches, make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF. Especially at LV, those few blocks make a big difference! Every amp of energy travelling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to get longer running time until you get stable power.%n%nOutput hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and inventories placed next to them such as chests or BC tanks. They will also void if they're full, so keep an eye on them!%n%nWhen building multiple EBFs, the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace can share walls. This can save you on input and output hatches too. Not recommended for energy and maintenance hatches!

# Quest: §3§lSafety First
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000871.name=§3§lSafety First
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000871.desc=For those new to GregTech, here are some tips and warnings about electricity. %n%nMachines don't like being out in the rain, and will start fires nearby. Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier cause an explosion. Or several, if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.%n%nSending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a wire does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.%n%nA generator that supplys 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than full voltage.  For example, macerators doing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run several off of a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. Why? Because there's loss for every amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are better than wires. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.%n%nMost machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier) + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding cables.%n%nSome machines are specifically for dealing with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers, and diodes.%n%nIf you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV and LV has thier own lossless cables). You can use the laser hatches much later to send even more.%n%nA single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.%n%nNote that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ tier. So 2 EU at LV, 4 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of your power, and even 1 can prevent usage of an EBF at MV voltage. Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes less of something to worry about.%n%nIf this info isn't enough for you, head on over to https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Electricity to read more.

# Quest: Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008a1.name=Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008a1.desc=First off, don't be scared by the massive amounts of bees you see here once you unlock the breeding trees. There's even more that aren't included and you'll need NEI to find!%n%nHa ha, just kidding - don't panic! Once you unlock the bee breeding lines, look around and pick and choose which bees really interest you. The way the breeding is done is mostly left to right, and top down. Some of the lines at the bottom might look simple, but they will require bees further up to complete first. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown here.%n%nBees have two sets of traits, one that is §aActive§r that has effects on how the bee lives, and one §3Inactive§r but can be used for breeding. Some traits are §4Dominant§r, and some are §9Recessive§r. Keep this in mind when trying to breed in or out a new trait. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the targeted bee traits. You can breed the bees with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. You can't see the passive traits using a Field Kit, you'll need a Beealyzer. For lots of bees, you can scan them first using a GT scanner, but you'll still need a Beealyzer to see passive traits.%n%nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee.  A bee that has little or no crossbreeding potential, but has all the traits you prefer - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility, etc.  Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.%n%nWhen you are trying for a new bee, what you are wanting is a drone - this way you can use your "breeding stock" princess for easy breeding, but the drone to get the new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poor crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good for this, since they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let them live longer. Once you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die (they can become ignoble under certain circumstances though, like using tons of production frames). Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits already, and there's a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect them with that.%n%nOnce you get a new species, it will replace all of one of the two sets of traits of the bee. §3If you get the mutation chance success twice on the same bee, it'll replace both active and inactive sets of traits though.§r For example when you get a Cultivated, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated! All the quests will require §6purebred§r species. PS: most effects are useless, so don't worry too much.%n%nAll traits can be bred into any bee species, aside from the species itself. Species also determines the preferred temperature and humidity, as well as drops. Species will require their preferred temerature and humidity to be in 'jubilant' state, and produce their special drops. You can also mimic this with the alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT with tolerances.%n%nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances, or to lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for that pristine princess to become ignoble!%n%nIt looks complex, because it is! But it's also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!

# Quest: Basic Bee Stats
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008a3.name=Basic Bee Stats
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008a3.desc=There are a couple of basic bees that have good stats you will want to breed into your breeding stock.%n%nCave Dwelling - Rocky - This lets you put the bee housing underneath or inside. Handy for putting a chest on top for products.%n%nNocturnal - Rocky - This keeps your bees working all night long, and in the dark.%n%nRain Tolerant - Water - Keep producing even when it is raining.%n%nHigh Fertility - Wintry - For breeding purposes, you want the maximum number of drones produced.%n%nReminder - Specialty products from bees require Jubilant state. That means the bee is in its §lNATURAL§r preferred climate. So it must not be in a biome it can tolerate due to temp/humidity improvements. For example, a Salt bee needs Warm/Normal climate. Even if it has +- humidity and temp, it will not produce its Salt comb unless it is in a Warm/Normal climate. Use Alveary upgrades to make sure it is in its preferred temp/humidity.

# Quest: Covering Up
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b0f.name=Covering Up
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b0f.desc=This quest goes over all of the covers, just in case you forgot or they weren't mentioned. If they have their own quest, look at it for more info. You can put them on basically any GT block, pipe, machine, tank, etc. Though that doesn't consider whether it will work right or be useful. Shift-Right-Click will open a GUI for many of them. For covers that you can adjust the amount of, clicking the left side with a screwdriver goes down, and right goes up. All covers block rain on the side they're attached to. Generally you can adjust covers with a screwdriver, whether they have a GUI or not. You can remove them with a crowbar if you forgot.%n%n§9§lFluid-Related Covers:§r%nPump: Transfers fluids at the speed specified on the tooltip.%n%nFluid Regulator: Regulates the rate that fluid can go through it, as well as pumping it. Can work x/s or x/t.%n%nSteam Valve: Moves more, but is only for steam. Only goes to IV. Does not work on SH steam.%n%nOverflow: Voids anything over the specified amount in the tank.%n%nFluid Detector: Will emit RS based on fluid fill rate of the tank it's on. By default, empty=15, full=0. Use inverted mode to swap. Useful on tanks and hatches.%n%nEnder Fluid Link: Cover version of ender tanks to TP fluid around. Doesn't connect to ender tanks though.%n%nDrain Module: Protects from rain on that side, and will fill the tank with water from rain if it can. Useless.%n%nFluid Filter: Filters fluid going through it. Click with a cell to set it.%n%nShutter: Blocks items/fluids when active. Use it with a machine controller and RS. Does not visually disconnect/block. You place it between the pipes, and put the MC on the same pipe.%n%n§2§lItem-Related Covers:§r%nConveyor: Sends items. Use an item pipe in import mode or on a GT block/machine.%n%nRobot Arm: Sends from a specific slot in the machine it's on (internal) to another specific slot in a block next to it (adjacent). Keep going through numbers until you get it right, it seems to change per machine. If the output slot is full, it won't output. There need to be a valid block with slots to send to or the settings won't save.%n%nItem Detector: Will emit RS based on item fill rate of the block it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Detects by filled slots, so doesn't work right with the super/quantum chests. Probably better for busses.%n%nItem Filter: WIP PR.%n%n§6§lEU-Related Covers:§r%nEnergy Detector: Will emit RS based on EU fill rate of the batbuff/tank it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Make sure to set it to include batteries. Can also detect steam for some reason.%n%nPower Pass Upgrade: Read the tooltip, then ask Bart how it works, he didn't bother telling anyone. He'll probably just tell you the code is the best documentation, just like the Tectech guys. May not actually be finished/work, either.%n%nTesla Coil/Tesla Coil Rich Edition: Use with the tesla tower to send EU wirelessly or something. %n%n§d§lOther Covers:§r%nPlayer Detector: Detects players. About 10 block range. §4Currently owner/other is inverted on non-pipes due to some bug or another.§r%n%nActivity Detector: Detects either recipe progress or idleness. 0%%=0 RS, ~95%%=14 by default. In idle mode, idleness is 15, and is 0 when running by default.%n%nMachine Controller: Turns machine on/off based on RS. Disable machine will keep it off regardless of RS state. Safe Mode only works on MBs. If a MB runs out of power, it will normally turn off, but a MC will turn it back on, continuing to void stuff. This will set it to the disable machine state instead. You will also get a notification. §4Safe mode is currently broken?§r%n%nNeeds Maintenance: Emits RS if it meets the condition specified. Rotor=turbine?%n%nRedstone Transmitter/Receiver (In/Out): OK, these things are confusing, so listen closely. First, set a frequency, either by using the GUI, or using the original way: right clicking it with an item. Empty hand = 0, other items = their item ID. Be careful not to reset it to 0 by accident. Honestly, just use the GUI. You can set it to private or not, it's the same kind of thing as EnderStorage, so you don't blare RS across the server. Channel state = RS level.%n%nRT(O) sets the channel state based on the redstone level sent from outside to the specific side. You can TP a RS from this to the RR(O).%nRT(I) sets the channel state based on redstone level that would be emitted from the machine itself. §4Always sends 15, so it's useless.§r%nRR(O) outputs redstone level based on channel state. You can TP RS from the RT(O) to here.%nRR(I) controls whether a machine can work based on channel state, just like a machine controller cover does. If it has 0 RS, it stays off. At least 1, and it turns on. You send the signal from elsewhere with the RT(O).%nRR(I) can also be used in conjunction with other covers whose states talk about conditional.%n%nIC2 Heat vents: Speeds up machines a tiny amount? Someone look through the code and tell me what it means. Also looks neat.%n%nCrafting Table: Adds a crafting table to the block you can use. Useless.%n%nPlanks/Plates/Foils: Blocks I/O on that side. Use a screwdriver to set allowed types of stuff through. Blocks everything by default. Set the output to another side first to avoid changing its settings too. You'll probably 'use' this by accident at least once.%n%nComputer Monitor: Adds a visual look. Useless, but sorta fancy.%n%nLens: Visual only. Useless.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b2a.desc=Thanks to the tireless work of the devs, you can now use cells to I/O fluids directly from the interface of GT machines. Just click on the fluid while holding a cell or other fluid container item.%n%nPoints to consider:%n1) Left click to attempt filling/emptying all fluid containers held on cursor.%n2) Right click to attempt filling/emptying one fluid container held on cursor.%n3) All fluid containers that can be used in a standard gt tank (e.g. super tanks or the X voltage tanks) are supported, including but not limited to: water bottles, vanilla buckets, ic2 (universal and normal) cells, volumetric flasks, large fluid cells, pressurized fluid tanks, etc.%n4) Can fill/take less than one cell (1000L or 144L if molten) of fluid if the fluid container supports doing so.%n5) It won't check if it's a valid fluid for the machine/recipe, keep that in mind.%n6) Doesn't work with Crops++ alcohols, feel free to code compatibility for us.%n7) EIO tanks need to be placed and picked up first before they can be used.

If you can drink cacti, you should also be able make water out of 8 cacti and use that for most recipes that require water. How cool is that? So what about another trade? 10 wood for... 3 cacti so you can setup a farm. Deal?%n%nTo automate the farm, place a string next to the cactus and a sand on top of the string. Now when the cactus grows, it will automatically break!  You can stack this horizontally and vertically to make a very efficient cactus farm.

If you didn't find a village yet (to grab some parts from the chest), you can only craft flint tools.%n%nLet's start with a pickaxe, an axe and a shovel. At this point swords are unobtainable since they need metals like iron or bronze which you will get at a later stage. In the meantime use your gregtech swords.%n%nYour new tools are weak at first, but the more you use them the better they will get. You get a modifer slot after some levels, needing more as you level it up. They will level up to level 99 if you play long enough, with 20 modifier slots. Tool parts can be replaced for a bit of level XP, however the tool must be fully repaired first.%n%nYou need to level up the mining level each time you replace the parts to unleash the full power of the pickaxe. Stone->Copper for this pickaxe. If you manage to get a Zombie, Skeleton, or Creeper head, you can use it to skip the level-up process.

# Quest: §2§lHow the Heck Do I Find Ores?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005d8.name=§2§lHow the Heck Do I Find Ores?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005d8.desc=GregTech ore generation is based on veins. Veins are centered on orecenters, based on the chunk number. Look at upper left of the screen to find the chunk number. Those infos are displayed by InGame Info XML mod. It has some useful info, but for now you need to see chunk info like "Chunk X: 3 Z: -2".%n%nThe 3,-2 is the chunk's address. Ignore the negative sign.  Now, the orecenters are located at 3N+1 chunks.  So, 4,7 is an orecenter. 10,16. -22,19.  Etc. %nProtip: to find out if a number is divisible by 3, add the digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3.  So 86 = 8+6 = 14. So you need to go down 1 chunk or up 2 chunks so that you are on a 3N+1 chunk.%n%nFor reading all the way, I'll give you an ingot of iron.%n%n§6TLDR: There's an ore vein every 3 chunks. Look in the upper left to see if you're over one.%n%n§3They have nothing to do with biomes, ok?

Our fancy bartimaeusnek developer has added a nifty feature to NEI that shows you where to find ores! Simply look for the oreblock in NEI, and click on it for info on where to find that ore.%n%nThere are many types of ores, even just for getting one material like Iron. So don't stick to only one type.%n%nYou can also search small ores, but not all of them are used.

Make sure you don't put too many animals in the pen or they will overcrowd and kill each other (this happens to villagers as well).%n%nAnimals will prioritize moving towards grass blocks over any other blocks, and if there's no grass blocks around, lit blocks over dark blocks. You can encourage animals to stay in pens (or at least not crowd the edges) by removing grass from around both sides of the fence (and under!) and placing a torch in the center of the pen. For sheep that need the grass to eat (reduces time to mature and replaces sheared wool instantly), place it in the center of a cleared out area with a border of non-grass.%n%nAlso, large quantities can cause server lag, especially if they are bumping into each other a lot. So make sure you limit animals to no more than ~ 1 per block for small entities like chickens and 1 entity per 2 blocks for large entities like cows if playing MP.%n%n§3PS: Most animal/mob drops can be gotten from less laggy IC2 crop farms.

You can also try jumping over the deep parts if it isn't that big.%n%nIf you are playing single player or a local server, horses make a great way to get around. On nonlocal servers they can cause problems and desync if you have poor internet, or if the server doesn't have good TPS.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002ce.desc=If you ever wanted to know how crop breeding works you are in the right place. Get some crops (the sticks) and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. %n%nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble.

Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.%n%nWhen they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.%n%nWith some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.%n%nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.%n%nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds. %n%nIf you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.%n%nNote that the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.%n%nDon't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing. %n%nCrossing happens when 2 or more almost mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a high chance of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation. More details in the IC2 cropnalyzer quest.

Other basic ore blocks can be purchased from the Coins tab.%n%nTo use, shift click when looking at the ground to open inventory and put the ore block into the slot. It has a 60 block range both up and down, this may miss redstone or graphite veins if they're very deep (Y5) and you're not at sea level (Y63).%n%n§3PS: It appears to work based off of GT's 'Material' system, so anything of the same material will work. Ie: an ingot, gem, plate, ore block, whatever. Anything that doesn't have a Material, it appears to search only for that block. You can't search for clay blocks with clay balls for instance.%n%n§rAs you get close, you will see and hear a response from the ore finder tool. You will see the wand tilt down when it discovers a match. Watch out - it will respond to small ores as well as normal ores so for Lapis and Redstone you will want to wait for large signal before digging. If it detects a large quantity of the ore you're looking for the wand will flip upside down completely. If you play with your sound on you will hear an obvious sound to notify you as well. The wand works in both your inventory and hotbar and you don't need to be actively holding it, though you get style points if you are holding it.%n%n§3You can craft magnetic iron rods by combining an iron rod with some redstone.%n%nAlso, because of the magical nature of the wand, the ore is stored with the player, not the wand. If you want to give the wand to someone else, remove the ore first.%n%n§4It doesn't work in space! The vast cosmic energies of the sun interfere with it's inner workings. Or we want you to use something more complicated than a stick, you choose.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000047a.desc=Maybe you are wondering why the new pipes don't auto-connect anymore? This was changed to make the pipes smarter. You can now use a wrench to connect only the pipes you want. You don't need a plate or a foil to prevent pipes from connecting anymore.%n%nPipes transferring anything hotter than a certain amount (like steam) will cause damage to a player touching them. You'll want to cover hot pipes to prevent getting hurt if you want to walk over them. Also, if the heat level is higher than the pipe's heat capacity, it will melt.%n%nRight clicking on a pipe in the center of the 'grid' will enable or disable a connection. It will have an X through it if the connection is enabled. You can do the same to any of the 4 corners to adjust the opposite side. You can similarly connect each of the 4 sides by clicking on the closest box in the grid.%n%nAlso, pipes now come with a shutter built in for free to reduce sloshing. Shift-rightclick with a wrench on the side you want prevent input.%n%nPipes will attempt to transfer 1/2 of the capacity twice per second, so the full capacity per second in total.%n%nLarge or Huge fluid pipes can be a poor man's storage tank, holding large amounts on their own.%n%nFor machine outputs, including the boilers, and RC water tanks (the one made of water tank siding), you will not need pumps. Other tanks will need pumps or Tinker's Construct faucets to move fluids.%n%nYou can put covers such as GT oak planks or plates on a pipe as well. Normally this prevents connections in that direction, but you can use a screwdriver to enable connections. This lets you make pipes that look nice going through walls. Use a crowbar to remove covers.%n%n§3Hint: If you click one pipe onto the other they will auto-connect.

Craft the bow limbs out of wood and the bow string out of strings. The arrow that has the most durability is bone, so craft the stick out of bone. It is much lighter but less durable than a regular arrow. Use a flint tip to make it repairable with flint.%n%n§4You can repair your bow the same way as all the other Tinkers tools.

Well, what if I told you you can get extra hearts just by expanding your palate. You get 1 point for every half shank of hunger from a food eaten, and after 50 points, you get 1 extra heart! Now you have a reason to make all those Pam's foods. Of course, each food only contributes it's shank value once, no cheating!%n%nIf you want to see what foods you've eaten, you can use the (not) handy Food Journal. Realistically though, you'll want to use NEI to both see foods eaten and not eaten. You can search for 'not yet eaten' to see foods left, and 'assisted' to see foods eaten. You need to have started diminishing returns first to see this.%n%n§3If it doesn't work for you, try the following. First, go to NEI options in the bottom left when the inventory is open, then click on inventory, and change Search Mode to Regex. Then restart your client, and try searching again.§r%n%nThere are also two commands:%n%n/foodlist size%nWill tell you total progress, and progress to next heart.%n%n/foodlist sync <PlayerName>%nIs to sync with the server if it gets out of sync.

So add the raw fish to your inventory and select the raw fish in your hotbar.%n%nJust like vanilla Minecraft, a tamed ocelot turns into a cat. The cat will repel creepers.%n%n§3TIP: Make sure you are in a large space when trying to tame the ocelot so that the ocelot has lots of room to move. If you are in a space that is too small, you will not be able to tame the ocelot.%n%nNext, while holding the raw fish, do not move. If you move, you will scare away the ocelot. If you are very still, the ocelot will eventually notice the fish in your hand and begin to walk over to you.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000046.desc=You've almost made it. One last crafting step is required in order to advance to Tier 1. Keep going!%n%nThis Steam Turbine generates electricity from Steam. The power source you've been using is the same, but from this point on you will generate EU, and bring it to your machines via cables, instead of bringing the Steam directly to them. Luckily, electric machines don't need an exhaust port, and they are considerably more efficient than Bronze machines.%n%nAt a later point, you will most likely switch from Steam to another fuel, though.

# Quest: §3§lSafety First
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000871.name=§3§lSafety First
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000871.desc=For those new to GregTech, here are some tips and warnings about electricity. %n%nMachines don't like being out in the rain, and will start fires nearby. Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier cause an explosion. Or several, if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.%n%nSending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a wire does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.%n%nA generator that supplys 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than full voltage.  For example, macerators doing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run several off of a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. Why? Because there's loss for every amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are better than wires. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.%n%nMost machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier) + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding cables.%n%nSome machines are specifically for dealing with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers, and diodes.%n%nIf you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV and LV has thier own lossless cables). You can use the laser hatches much later to send even more.%n%nA single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.%n%nNote that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ tier. So 2 EU at LV, 4 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of your power, and even 1 can prevent usage of an EBF at MV voltage. Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes less of something to worry about.%n%nIf this info isn't enough for you, head on over to https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Electricity to read more.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000047b.desc=They work basically the same as pipes, but you need wire cutters (or a soldering iron) instead of a wrench. Additionally, you take damage if they're not insulated (wire) but not if they are (cable).%n%nHint: If you click one wire or cable on the other it will auto-connect. Cables and pipes can be painted to make sure you do not cross your MV line with your EV line, or dump hot lava into your plastic water pipes.

You can make the Reinforcement which gives a reinforced modifier which increases the durability of your tool. Reinforced level X makes a tool unbreakable.%n%n§3PS: In many cases this is not worth it, since the tools don't degrade that fast, it doesn't cost much to repair, and you get better materials (with higher durability) to make them out of reasonably fast. Plus, by the time you got it to unbreakable, you'd be auto-mining everything with a miner anyway. Just use redstone, or maybe luck/silky. However, there are a few very nice uses cases like lumber axes and tools for automation setups.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000003b4.name=§3§lBetter Than Iron
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000003b4.desc=But not as good as steel. Mostly, this is used in machine hulls, or in tools if you don't want to use steel up for that.%n%nTo make wrought iron, you need a tinkers smelter to melt some iron ingots down and cast nuggets; or use an ingot and a saw to get your nuggets. Now put these in a furnace to get wrought iron nuggets. With the compressor, you can compress the nuggets into ingots.%n%n§3Hint: Crushed or purified iron ore (not a mixed version like pyrite, look for Iron Ore in Chalcopyrite veins) can be smelted to iron nuggets directly. Or you can use an alloy smelter to turn iron ingots into nuggets faster than a smeltery. You can also use a saw to cut up iron ingots into nuggets.%n%nLater on, you can use an arc furnace to make wrought iron ingots directly.%n%n

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000468.desc=Maybe you were lucky and received the luck modifier on your pickaxe. If not, you may still have an unused modifier on your pick so you can add some lapis lazuli. Or you can perhaps add another modifier by adding a diamond and a gold block to your pick and then add some lapis. %n%nYou can put the lapis lazuli in more than one slot in the tool station, use blocks to raise the luck level faster, and even use lapis blocks in the crafting station with your tool for maximum luck gain.%n%n§3Since it only affects small ore it might not be worth it to you to use. Also, if you lack in lapis, you can put 1 point on, and then mine stuff, and it will sometimes gain more points, up to the 450 limit.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000004b5.desc=Hoppers come in handy when you want to automate your machines. You can input items via hoppers directly into GT pipes and you don't have to use a conveyor module. However, the input rate is much slower, and the hopper must be beneath its source inventory.

# Quest: §3§lBowl Full of Spaghetti
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000006c7.name=§3§lBowl Full of Spaghetti
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000006c7.desc=Or at least factories full of item pipes. With these simple item pipes and conveyors you can take items out of one machine and feed them immediately into a second machine.%n%nLater on you can make better item pipes. Search for "item pipe" in NEI for options.%n%n§4You'll need a Steel Wrench to remove them. Don't place them down unless you're sure of the location until you have one.

# Quest: §3§lMore Advanced Alloys
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000002e.name=§3§lMore Advanced Alloys
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000002e.desc=Your smeltery does a great job mixing metals into alloys, but it's not very efficient, and limited in its complexity. You need something new, so why not put your steam to some use? The Alloy Smelter can make bronze for you directly, using ingots, dusts, or even nuggets. You can make a nugget mold as well to turn ingots into nuggets if you have steel.%n%nIt might also come in handy when processing raw rubber. You should keep an eye on recipes to see when machines offer better options to make items...%n%n§4NOTE: Like all steam machines, the output port doubles as a steam outlet when recipes complete. It must not be blocked. Also, steam is hot, remember? Change the output side by whacking with a wrench. The 3x3 grid will show you which side the output will move to when you whack it.%n%nIf you try enabling item output, you'll see it comes out the same side as the steam outlet. How unfortunate! However you can still empty the machine by putting a hopper beneath it. %n%nWARNING: The Alloy Smelter recipes take a §llot§r of steam. Do them one by one until you understand how fast you use steam, and how much you will need buffered. Large pipes are a decent "poor mans" buffer, and the boiler can hold quite a bit of steam, as well as the machine itself. Once you get a little further along, make a larger steam buffer with an iron or steel railcraft tank.

# Quest: §3§lWhere Can I Put All the Liquids?

Oil can be burned directly in a combustion generator (onsite to power the pump, perhaps?) or be refined for better fuels and crafting materials. %n%nBring a generator or battery buffer (with full batteries obviously) with you to power the pump. Thanks to the advancement of technology the pump can auto output on top. Stacking multiple pumps makes them work faster. In that case, oil has to be removed from the bottom of the stack using a pump cover or other means like a conduit.%n%nTaller spouts have more oil. But for the LV pump, it's better to use the short spouts if possible since it doesn't have enough range to fully collect the larger ones in the horizontal range. Save the taller spouts for MV or HV pumps.%n%nMining pipes are needed for pumping the oil, same as the auto miner. When it hits the bottom (or something in the way), if there's no fluid left to collect, it will start retracting the pipes. Same thing if you disable it with a soft mallet. You can also change the range with a screwdriver if there's a reason to do that, like collecting lava in a limited area faster.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on all sides. And set a waypoint with JourneyMaps so you don't forget where you placed it!%n%n§3Once you run out of surface oil, you'll want to turn to:%n1) Oilsands ore, though this is better suited for making heavy oil%n2) Making oil from logs in a pyro%n4) Ridiculous bio vat nonsense%n5) Crops%n6) Bees%n7) The real answer, which is Underground or UG oil.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000442.desc=Pumps can do more than pump oil and water. You can go to the nether and pump lava from the huge lava lakes too.%n%nOnce you reach HV, lava can be centrifuged for Silicon Dioxide, Magnesia, Quicklime, Gold, Sapphire, and Tantalite. You can get Silicon, Magnesium, Calcium, Gold, Aluminium, Manganese, Tantalum, and Oxygen out of them.%n%nThis is a good use for your LV pumps once you upgrade to MV pumps for oil. If you get into Thaumcraft or Blood Magic, there are ways to produce lava with magic unlimitedly and easily too.%n%n§3You'll want either ULV tanks and cells, or BC tanks and a dolly to transport your lava.

# Quest: §5§lLong Distance Fluid Pipeline
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000098c.name=§5§lLong Distance Fluid Pipeline
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000098c.desc=Wouldn't it be great if you could transport your oil from a far away oil spout or oil field by pipes to your base?%n%nThis is not a problem anymore. Connect your setup on the start and end point with a Long Distance Fluid Pipeline block. Inbetween use the associated pipe blocks - the total distance between endpoints must be more than 64 blocks apart (4 or more chunks). There can only be one start and end point per pipeline.%n%nTo actually connect it, you need to align the start LDFP block such that the arrows are facing inwards, and the opposite side of it has a LDFPP block. Put a pump on the side of the block that has the arrows and set to import. It will now attempt to import fluid to the endpoint LDFP. §2This will go as fast as you can put fluid into it.§r%n%nDo the opposite on the far side, except you don't need a pump.%n%nNow you only need to chunkload the start and end points and the fluid will be "teleported" to you.%n%nOf course, later on you'll probably use ender tanks to §oactually§r teleport the fluid, especially from other dims.%n%nThis setup is lag-free in the pipe blocks, so it's useful in your base as well if you want to reduce lag.

# Quest: §5§lDust to Crystals
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000303.name=§5§lDust to Crystals
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000303.desc=Use the autoclave to crystallize your dust. You can also make raw carbon mesh out of carbon dust, and do other things.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000037b.desc=The next version of GT tanks stores 64,000L in a tank. It actually requires a pump this time, so it's a little expensive. Consider staying with your ULV ones if you only need basic I/O.

# Quest: §5§lGT MV Tank...Already?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000037c.name=§5§lGT MV Tank...Already?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000037c.desc=These store 128,000L. The dark steel plates and LV pump make it a little annoying to make, since it needs an EBF.

# Quest: §5§lSimple Ore Washer
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000382.name=§5§lSimple Ore Washer
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000382.desc=Too lazy to make an ore washer, yet bored with your non-automatable cauldron? Then the simple washer is the machine for you! It works reasonably fast and uses only 8eu max - make sure you don't provide too much voltage! Ok, so you don't get any byproducts, but who cares!%n%n§3They're only every other tier, which is why there's no LV one.

# Quest: §5§lULV Transformer
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000046f.name=§5§lULV Transformer
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000046f.desc=To get your simple ore washer working you need a ULV Transformer. The Washer can only work with 8 EU. If you put more energy into it you get a big hole in your base.%n%n§3This will probably be the only one you make in the game.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000004f9.desc=If you want brews or alcohol, I recommend you to build one of these. You might have noticed that you cannot build a brewing stand without Thaumcraft. But fear not, you can still find them in secret rooms on the first floor of some roguelike dungeons or ur-ghast towers. Better get searching...

# Quest: §5§lLubricant
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000043c.name=§5§lLubricant
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000043c.desc=Using lubricant instead of water or distilled water in your cutting machines will increase their speed.%n%nYou can make lubricant out of oil, seed oil, fish oil or creosote in a distillery (or distillation tower later on). If you're able to craft a brewery you can use talc or soapstone to get much more lubricant each cycle.%n%nLube cells are required to make low tier energy hatches, so stockpile a few cells and use the rest to make your cutting machine faster.

# Quest: §5§lFerment Your Brew!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000004fa.name=§5§lFerment Your Brew!

Well, the chemical bath is perfect for you! %n%nYou'll have to provide liquids like mercury to extract different products like nickel, silver, copper, and platinum (only as PMP) from ores. %n%nFor paper you'll only need some water and wood pulp. Maybe you'll find more uses for it!

# Quest: §5§lFilling the World With Fluids...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000736.name=§5§lFilling the World With Fluids...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000736.desc=Need to make a lake? Look no further than the Flood Gate. It will fill the world with any fluid you provide it, up to the level below the gate. This can get kinda laggy in a large area, so keep that in mind.

# Quest: §5§lFaster Steam Transportation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b21.name=§5§lFaster Steam Transportation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b21.desc=Do you think that steam fluid transport is far too slow? Your LV pumps got you down, doing only 640L/s? Then it's time to make the 32 times faster LV steam valves!%n%nThey only work with steam and are just as fast as the valve on a Railcraft tank (if you put it on the bottom side).%n%n§6§4§3There's also MV, HV, EV and IV versions.

# Quest: §5§lYour Oil is Too Crude? Refine it!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000223.name=§5§lYour Oil is Too Crude? Refine it!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000223.desc=Burning oil in the combustion generator is a very inefficient way of producing power. Every bucket/cell of oil only gives you 20,000 EU. Time to refine it.%n%nYou'll need to use a circuit to pick which of the products you want. Later on you can make a Distillation Tower to get all of them, but that's far away for now.%n%nYou can also distill many other fluids! There are two that are useful, but take a long time to distill, so you should set them up in advance: Lubricant (from Creosote) and Distilled Water (from Water).

# Quest: §5§lLight Sulfuric Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000224.name=§5§lLight Sulfuric Fuel

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000281.desc=You can process Sulfuric Naphtha to fluid Naphtha which has a burn value of 320,000 EU in the Gas Turbine. Naphtha can be used to get Rthylene for Polyethylene, but it shares this use with Refinery Gas and Light Fuel, so decide for yourself which one you want to use. %n%nIf you choose to make High-Octane Gasoline in EV and onwards, it will need a lot of Naphtha. You can also make Polycaprolactam (Nylon), which doesn't have any useful purpose yet, but it might get some in the near future.

# Quest: §5§lSulfuric Gas

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000283.desc=Refine your gas in a chemical reactor with Hydrogen gas to give it a better burn value of 160,000 EU. It used to be the least useful fraction of oil, but it's now possible to distill it into large amounts of Ethylene if you steam-crack the Refinery Gas beforehand.%n%nThis early, you will have to use a Chemical Reactor to crack it, but later on there's a dedicated multiblock for this purpose, the Oil Cracker. For best Ethylene results, you should severely steam-crack it, and you will get lots of Methane as well.

# Quest: §5§lMethane
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000284.name=§5§lMethane
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000284.desc=Distilling some "refinery gases" gives you some methane gas. There are many more (and probably better) ways to get methane.%n%nYou will need this in later tiers, for PTFE as an example.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000348.desc=You can crack and distill a lot of different fluids out of your already distilled products, such as Butane, Butene, Butadiane, Benzene, Ethane, Ethylene, Helium, Hydrogen, Methane, Octane, Propane, Propene, Toluene, and even more Light Fuel, Heavy Fuel, or Naphtha. You can then crack them down even further too sometimes. Many of these are only used for power. Go check out the spreadsheet for more details than this quest can encompass.%n%nFor now, get some Butane and Propane.

# Quest: §5§lLPG
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000280.name=§5§lLPG
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000280.desc=Centrifuging Butane or Propane gives you LPG with a burn value of 320,000 EU, the same as naphtha.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000228.desc=By adding Hydrogen to sulfuric Heavy Fuel in a Chemical Reactor you can produce Heavy Fuel, with a burn value of 240,000 EU per cell! Aside from this, it's also required for Diesel, in MV, which is a better fuel, and it can also be distilled into three very useful fluids: Benzene, Toluene and Phenol.%n%nIt's honestly not especially efficient to make Heavy Fuel out of regular Oil. You should try to get Heavy Oil to make it, like from Oilsands Ore in MV once you can. Then use it to make Diesel.

# Quest: §5§lChemical Rubber Production
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002d6.name=§5§lChemical Rubber Production
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002d6.desc=A much more efficient way to make insulated cables is by making molten rubber in a chemical reactor, which can be applied to a cable in the assembling machine. When you put both machines next to each other you can output the molten rubber directly to the assembling machine by clicking the fluid auto-output button on the chemical reactor. Make sure to set the correct side of the reactor as output side by wrenching it. Also remember to use the right circuit in the assembling machine.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000243.desc=You heard that the carpenter needs some molten redstone for a few recipes. Converting redstone dust into a fluid requires a fluid extractor. Let's build one.%n%nIf you want to get that molten redstone into a cell, you'll need a fluid canner instead of a GT tank. Why? Because Reasons.%n%nFortunately, most fluids work properly, but redstone, cracked fluids, and certain other ones do not. Or just use a universal cell.

Instead of doing that, put an enderman into a smeltery with hot fluids and use a gem cast to get guaranteed pearls. %n%nThe higher the hit points, the longer they'll last, so the more pearls you get. If you can find a regenerating enderman, or an enderman spawner, you'll have all the pearls you would ever want. Later on with EnderIO you can even create your own powered spawner to make endermen on-demand. Or just place it in the End and move the mobs inside.%n%nUse a nametag on a regenerating enderman to make sure he doesn't despawn. You'll want to keep him from seeing the sky or else he'll teleport away.%n%nIf you haven't found a regen enderman yet, you can buy enderman spawn eggs to put into your smeltery with coins. Maybe you'll get lucky and get a regenerating one.

You won't find much on the Overworld because of obvious reasons. To get additional zinc crushed ore drops, use a Tinker's Construct tool with the Luck (Fortune) enchant on it, probably the best use for all that lapis you got while looking for calcite. Or use a miner, if you don't mind how slow it is.%n%n- Sphalerite can be electrolyzed for a small chance of a gallium dust. Better put in a lot or you might get unlucky.%n- Zinc crushed ore can be washed and then thermal centrifuged or forge hammered and then centrifuged. But you don't always get the crushed ore as a drop, the impure dust doesn't give gallium.%n%nYou can get arsenic from realgar small ores in the Nether at Y 15-85. Centrifuge the dusts in a centrifuge.%n%nOther sources are Tinker's Construct cobalt ore in the nether and cobaltite ore in the Twilight Forest. You can use your EBF for that. You also need to level up your pickaxe to ardite or make an Ironwood Pickaxe or LV Miner to harvest cobalt ore.%n%nAnother way to get gallium and arsenic is with XP buckets in a crafting grid if you're really desperate.%n%nWith your EBF you can combine these two dusts to make a Gallium Arsenide Crystal.

You can crush the Gallium Arsenide crystals to dust and combine that with fine copper wires and molten glass. Once you have solar grade silicon you can use it to make silicon wafers in your EBF to make even more. Note that the wafers are much more efficient on gallium and arsenic, so even a reduced amount is still worth it.%n%nMake sure you check all the NEI recipes for advanced items instead of just using the first one you find.

This nifty machine will collect ores for you, which can be helpful especially in the Nether, as it won't anger pigmen.%n%nPlace up to two stacks of mining pipes in the right slots. Each pipe can go 1 block, and allow the miner to dig 1 block further. If you're above Y64, you may need to pipe more in.%n%nThis machine only needs 8 EU/t to work, so LV batteries in a batbuff work ok if you don't want to make another generator.%n%nThe miner searches for ores in a 17x17 block work area (adjustable with a screwdriver), and comes with a level 1 fortune bonus! Great for gathering additional small ores!%n%nDon't forget to cover it up! These are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on all sides.

Connect your setup on the start and end point with a Long Distance Item Pipeline block. Inbetween use the associated pipe blocks - the total distance between endpoints must be more than 64 blocks apart (4 or more chunks). There can only be one start and end point per pipeline.%n%nTo actually connect it, you need to align the start LDIP block such that the arrows are facing inwards, and the opposite side of it has a LDIPP block. Put a conveyor on the side of the block that has the arrows and set to import. It will now attempt to import stuff to the endpoint LDIP. §2This will go as fast as you can put items into it.§r%n%nDo the opposite on the far side, except you don't need a conveyor.%n%nNow you only need to chunkload the start and end points and the items will be "teleported" to you.%n%nOf course, later on you'll probably use ender chests to §oactually§r teleport the ore, especially from other dims.%n%nThis setup is lag-free in the pipe blocks, so it's useful in your base as well if you want to reduce lag.

Now you have a book with detailed info about the chunks you scanned.%n%nOre locations are given as the center of the chunk. Ores that are marginal in that chunk may not be found in the center but on an edge. Look at where ores are located and determine the center of the vein. At higher tiers, it scans more chunks for ores. If you just want to know about fluids, use the lower tier version so the book isn't as long.%n%nEach underground fluid field is 8x8 chunks. This starts at 0,0 and continues for 8 chunks east and south, containing 64 chunks. Not all fields have anything in them though. Within the field the amount can vary +/- 25 percent. The amount reported in the book is the minimum and maximum per field across all chunks in the field. The prospector reports on 3x3 fields (as in, 9 fields of 8x8 chunks) at all tiers with the center field where the seismic prospector is located. Fluid extraction rate depends on many factors, check the wiki for details. In general, anything above 300 is really good. The total amount in the chunk is complicated. %n%n

It's a great way to run your base, and can be upgraded further in the next tiers. Check the "Working with Oil" tab for more information, once you've made a Pump and found some Oil.%n%n§3If you're dealing with Oil processing, this is the type of generator you'll use the most.§r

You can use Steam up to IV, but beyond MV it gets pretty painful. %n%nIn LV you can start refining oil for either Light Fuel for a Combustion Generator or Refinery Gas for a Gas Turbine. %n%nOnce you hit MV you can switch from Steam to renewable Benzene (Gas) from your logs. Other renewable alternatives are Fish Oil or Seed Oil based bio diesel (combustion). Seed Oil can be sourced from Pam's peanuts, IC2 Rape crop or Forestry tree nuts.%n%nAt MV you can also upgrade your Light Fuel with Heavy Fuel to get Diesel. When you reach HV turn diesel or bio diesel into Cetane Boosted Diesel. In EV, you can make HOG, but it's complex, and you'll need to rejigger your whole oil distillation setup, since it uses different fluids than Cetane does.%n%nEV introduces the Large Gas Turbine, Large Steam Turbine, Large HP Steam Turbine, and Large Combustion Engine, which are more efficient versions of the earlier ones. The first 3 require turbines. %n%nYou can also make Nukes, or Wind and Water Kinetics.%n%nFor low-power operations, or dedicated players willing to setup autocrafting, you can begin using Solar Panels at MV.

Too lazy to bother finding some Ironwood in the Twilight Forest, even though it's super duper easy?%n%nYou can make it with your EBF now using Cobaltite Ore from the Twilight Forest and Oxygen to get Cobalt. It's a little complicated, but you also get arsenic out of it.%n%n§3You can also just electrolyze it out in MV, which is what you §oshould§r§3 be doing instead of this, assuming you actually need it.


## Quest Line: Tier 2 - MV
betterquesting.questline.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004.name=Tier 2 - MV
betterquesting.questline.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004.desc=Your second voltage tier. Don't mix different voltage levels, or you'll have a fancy new crater. Start thinking about how to expand your base. %n%nBTW, for OCing purposes, this counts as tier 2, ULV doesn't count.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000047c.desc=The next tier of machine hull needs aluminium. You're gonna need it for every machine and machine part for this tier, so keep that EBF truckin'.%n%nDid you remember to read the Safety First quest for details about mixing tiers? The most applicable part to remember here is that sending MV to an LV machine will cause it to explode. Sending MV voltage over LV cables causes them to melt, which causes a fire that can also cause an explosion. Additionally, recipes done in a tier higher than the original one (not ULV, ULV counts as LV) are overclocked. OC'd recipes use 4x power, and complete 2x faster.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000099.desc=Translocators can only transfer items over a distance of 1 block. But they're quite cheap, and a good solution to building compact machine setups. They include a free simple item filter which can be enabled on the input or output side. And they support multiple inputs and outputs! Glowstone will make it transfer faster - try investigating other upgrades.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002da.desc=You've been using steam, creosote, and possibly oil plus their byproducts to generate power. It's time to start making bio diesel. The first step is to make plant balls out of organic materials. You can use wheat, sugarcane, apples, saplings or, well, practially anything. Indigo blossoms are 4:1 and unlike the rest of the IC2 crops with the same ratio, not really useful for anything else. Realistically, you'll probably just use saplings though, since you'll want/need a tree farm anyway.%n%nBe sure you have a Forestry multifarm, Steve's Carts Farm, IC2 Crop Sticks with a harvester, or whatever, because you need plenty of biomaterials for constant bio diesel production.

# Quest: §6§lPlantballs

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002db.desc=Next you should compress plantballs out of your wheat.%n%nThe MV compressor is twice as fast as the LV. You might think this means using it is a good idea. You would be §4WRONG§r. Why? Remember it also uses 4x the power. This means you spend 4x the EU to get the same amount of EU, twice as fast. Eventually, you end up with an EU deficit with this kind of setup, though not necessarily this setup. Ironic, I know. You can use multiple machines (like, a lot), and later use a Processing Array or multiblock if there is one. This applies to all fuel production, basically.

# Quest: §6§lPlant Mass

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002de.desc=The first way you get biomass out of bio chaff is to use the IC2 Fluid Canner. One bucket of water and one bio chaff gives one bucket of biomass.%n%n§4This option is not really recommended. You should focus on GT machines, not IC2. It also has some buggy interaction with normal cells, you might need to use universal cells.

It's probably time to add a second EBF to your base.%n%nMultiblock machines can share casings, mufflers, and input/output hatches/busses, but not maintenance hatches (you can share the auto ones though). You can share energy hatches, but only if you can supply enough power to all machines it's a part of. So if you have two EBFs that both want MV power, and you use a MV Energy Hatch, it won't work, since neither will get enough power. This is almost never used, so don't worry about it. Also, if you want to share inputs on Processing Arrays, turn off recipe map filtering on the busses.%n%nRemember, pollution will be very high with two EBFs active at once! Watch out for high pollution effects. Use the best mufflers available and don't place the EBFs in the same chunk as farmland or other high pollution machines like Pyrolyse Ovens and Large Boilers.%n%nYou can use whatever coils you have lying around, but you might want to start searching for Mica if you haven't found any yet.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000969.desc=Rare Earth processing may have been ignored, but you believe your new Dehydrator can finally make it worthwhile. First, you need to use some Sulfuric Acid to melt off any impurities in a Chemical Bath, leaving you with Crushed Rare Earth (I). After that you need to process it like a normal ore until you get Rare Earth (I) Dust.%n%nAfter running the Dust through your Dehydrator, you get a number of strange materials, only some of which you recognize. But if you run these materials through an Electrolyzer or through the Dehydrator again, you may get some use out of them. Some of them may take quite a few to do so, but you §o§o§r§h§ohave§r been stockpiling, right?

It guzzles amps though, so your power infrastructure better be ready for it. The tooltip will list the performance boost provided. For block-based acceleration, the WA will do an area around it. For TileEntities like most machines, it will only accelerate the blocks directly touching the WA, and will need to be reconfigured with a screwdriver. This uses twice the power though.%n%n§4This does not work with GregTech machines!§r For those, build more or higher tier ones.%n%nIf you want, you can change the level of acceleration by using a wrench on it. It will go back to the minimum, then increase one tier from there for every usage. It will use that tier's amount of power (and acceleration), increasing as per GT standard of 2x speed (acceleration) and 4x EU per tier.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ce.desc=A low tech method to cool down the hot coolant is to use vent covers. Just place the cover on any GregTech block which can contain IC2 coolant and place water in front. The easiest might be just a tank or pipe. This will help until you have access to a Large Heat Exchanger or a Vacuum Freezer.%n%nAn advanced or overclocked reactor vent is much faster than a basic heat vent but you can't make those yet.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000968.desc=Now that you have MV Circuits and Stainless Steel, you can make the incredibly handy Drawer Controller. This block will make any drawers it connects to in a 4-block radius (including the y-axis) and 50 blocks at maximum as part of a multiblock that allows storage (and retrieval with the right setup) to any of the blocks that make it up. This will allow you to dump the contents of your mining trip into a storage system much easier. Just hold right click on the Controller front for a second or two, and any items that match what's already in the multiblock will be deposited, while your tools and such won't. Just make sure to place your Controller last so it registers all the drawers.%n%nYou can feed into the Controller (and thus the rest of the drawers) with any kind of piping or hopper equivalent. If using it as part of a Multifarm or Mob Farm, make sure to set the contents of the drawers, and lock them with a key so that it properly stores everything in an organized manner. If the drawers' contents aren't set, it will start filling starting from the ones closest. If you wish to have more than one drawer full of an item, put a void upgrade on the drawer further from the Controller, and it will fill the first one, then the second.%n%nIf you want to go around corners, use the Trim Drawers to extend the multiblock. If you want to have a second point to dump items into, use the Controller Slave (one per multiblock, automation only). Note that you can use a key on the Controller to affect all drawers at once.%n%nOnce you have an ME Network, place a storage bus on the Controller, and the entire inventory will be accessible from the network, with both storage and retrieval. Just remember to set the priority higher than your ME Drives. If you haven't locked them yet expect all your drawers to fill with random items from your ME Network.%n%n§4Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will tank TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.%n%nAdditionally, expect all non-backpack interactions to be DISABLED on the official servers. Congratulations, Drawer Cubists, you ruined it for everyone.

These are needed to run the Kinetic Wind Generator.%nOnce a Rotor is placed inside the GUI, the block is given sufficient space, and the current wind level is adequate for the current rotor, the Kinetic Wind Generator will begin to generate Kinetic Energy. %n%nThis can be converted into EU by using a Kinetic Generator attached to the correct face (the black circle).%n%nAbout Wind%nFirst off, the wind strength of a particular area is affected by 3 factors: Height, Weather, and Chance. The higher up in the world you are, the higher the wind level. Below y64, there is never enough wind to be used, and KWG's will not function at all. Weather will also give boosts; Rainy weather will give a 20%% boost to normal wind levels, and stormy weather will give a 50%% boost. The final factor of chance makes the wind strength vary randomly, however there is a limited range of variation.%n%nThe easiest way to check the current wind level in an area is by using a Windmeter. Wind is strongest at around Y160, towards the build limit of Y255 there is very little wind, hence no point attempting to run Windmills that high. While inconvenient, the Wind Generator can run anywhere.

Well there are couple of ways, but at EV you'll need to radiate Glowstone and convert to Sunnarium.%n%nThe Glowstone rod will slowly charge up if you put it next to any fuel rod in your IC2 reactor. The exact charging speed is `(number of rods adjacent) * (floor(hull temperature/3000) + 1)` per second. A dual rod will count as 2 rods and quad fuel rod will count as 4 rods for this purpose. The Glowstone rod will neither emit heat, nor cause other component to emit more heat. You can treat this rod as a reactor plating in the IC2 Reactor Planner.%n%nAs you can see, the speed is directly proportional to hull temperature and rods adjacent. At the very extreme you can fully charge up a Glowstone rod in less than half a minute and output one Sunnarium every 10 second (on average, since cells aren't charged at same speed due to different position), but that require very considerable resource to setup. It also involves a vacuum freezer to cooldown the coolant cells and running the reactor at 66000+ hull temperature. Balance your need and your resource situation wisely.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a78.desc=When making Raw Crystal Chips, you have two other options if using Europium constantly is too expensive for you: Bacterial Sludge, and Mutagen.%n%nMutagen is obviously better than the sludge, but how do you get it? I'll teach you how.%n%nFirst, get the Bacterial Sludge you got from Mars, and run it through a Brewery along with some U-238 to get EnrichedBacterialSludge. Then Ferment it to get FermentedBacterialSludge. And finally you Distill it to get Mutagen.%n%nBut is a single bucket enough for you? Hardly! But now that we have some, we can make more with the vat. Use the Mutagen you got along with some of that Mysterious Crystal Dust to make a culture. Unfortunately the chances are pretty low, so you'll almost certainly have to do it several times.%n%nOnce you have your culture you can use it in the vat along with some of the dust again to make more. You'll need LuV-tier glass, and Plutonium rods.%n%nIf you want to get more Bacterial Sudge more easily, you can use the vat to make that too! The culture is much easier to make.%n%n§3Mutagen is also used for Gendustry, so if you want to do that, make a bunch.

You'll need to slice the circuits for the imprint in either a tier-appropriate slicing machine, or the Cutting Factory in slicing mode.%n%nTo use the imprints, place them in the CAL controller's item slot. The CAL will be imprinted once you turn it on. You can see what it's imprinted with by using a portable scanner on the controller. You can also swap out controllers if you're too lazy to make more CALs.%n%n§3If you already have an imprint for an earlier version of a recipe, you don't need to make another, it works with both recipes.%n%n§4Because of the way oredicting and recipes work, slicing LV or HV circuits in the Cutting Factory will not work properly, so use at least an HV slicing machine for those.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000004bc.desc=Now that your power needs are increasing, you need a way to keep up with demand. To generate over 1A ZPM with a single machine you have two options: solars, and fusion.%n%nWhile solars are simpler to set up, solars cap out at 524288 EU/t. Fusion can reach levels close to eight times that with the right setup. %n%nFor your first reactor, you will need a controller, 2-16 fluid input hatches, 1-16 fluid output hatches, and 16 energy hatches. All hatches have to be LuV tier or better. Each hatch provides 2048 EU/t for the recipe, and has a storage capacity of 10M eu. %n%nThis means you can do any fusion recipe that takes less than 32768 EU/t or less, and has a startup cost of 160M EU or less. Using more fluid hatches means you need less fusion casings. While this doesn't matter as much for the mk1 reactor, this principle helps tremendously with the higher reactor tiers.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000004b1.desc=Your fancy new Large Plasma Turbine will need a rotor to go inside of it. %n%nYou can make it out of any GT material, but the best right now is NORMAL Draconium. §4Always test in Creative first!§r%n%nWhen using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Plasma Turbines being the best at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 250%% of optimal flow to produce 158%% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 400%% of optimal flow to produce 214%% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 550%% of optimal flow to produce 301%% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.%n%nThe choice is yours!%n%n§3For a lot of extra information on fusion, check out the new quest line called Powerful Nuclear Physics.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000aaa.desc=Laser hatches are a high-end way of sending lots of amps of power, so much in fact, that it starts at 32A. This goes 32/64/96/128/256+ and continues from there. They're also so powerful that only a few machines support them outside of the ever §owonderful§r TecTech: LSC, MEBF, MVF. and PSS. (Might be added in the future!) Remember to color both the Laser Vacuum Pipes, and the Source and Target Hatches. Also, Source = Output, Target = Input.%n%nLaser Converters are basically: Laser Source (on machine) -> Vacuum Pipes -> LC -> 5x output split into X amps, 32 for the first. Make sure to put it into recieve mode. Or do it the other way around if you want to go up, it's basically a transformer that converts laser to/from cables. You can also use them to turn the lasers if you don't mind 3x the loss on device output (and not sending all the amps) compared to the Active Transformer (because of loss on each output). Just remember to put a battery buffer in between if you want it to work.%n%n§3You can use the Low Power Laser Pipes if using a 'Low Power' Hatch or Converter, but keep in mind you'll need to connect them with wire cutters yourself after coloring them.%n%n§cBe careful with using very high ampere hatches as every Laser Hatch has 1EU/s per max. ampere passive power loss.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000007d7.desc=One of the most incredibly complicated machines, this will serve as the main structure for your Computation generation for the Research Station. %n%nFirst, you'll need a few things: the Quantum Computer itself, The Uncertainty Resolver, some good circuits and the Computer Racks to hold them, and at least a UV energy hatch (maybe start with a UV 4A energy hatch). The QC will consume 1A of UV, and each rack will use one more. So another important factor is to ONLY turn on the Quantum Computer once you have the desired recipe for the Research Station ready to avoid excess energy loss. Remember to turn the QC on BEFORE the RS. In order for you to build this absolute monster, you'll need to place down the Quantum Computer at least 1 block above the surface/ground and use the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector to see where to place everything. The blocks with no dots next to the vents indicate that that space must be empty. Later you'll want to build a bigger QC. Use a stack of multiple Hologram Projectors to see how that is build. If at some point even a maximum size QC with 24 racks is no longer sufficient, you can also chain multiple QCs. For now, let us focus on a basic setup.%n%nUncertainty Resolver:%nA mini-game that might take you a bit to understand. Your goal is to balance the lights around the focal points. Sometimes, the Schrödinger Status will require some puzzle solving again after a period of time. This is random and incredibly frustrating, especially during operations being done between the Research Station and Quantum Computer(s), so it is important to constantly check the Uncertainty Resolver before you start operations on your Computer. If the puzzle looks too hard or you can't complete it, just remove it and the controller and re-place them to get a different puzzle.%n%nComputer Racks:%nThe main component within the multiblock to generate Computation. In order to achieve this, you will need to input some circuits and ic2 heat vents; Advanced Heat Vents work best. It is critical that you use Heat Vents to prevent the heat from reaching a catastrophic point. Computer Racks will always melt or explode about 9000 heat (also written as 90 percent, 10000 being 100 percent) but most circuits have much lower thresholds. For our example here we will use Ultimate Crystalcomputers. With these, any heat above 54 percent should be avoided for safety reasons! The maximum heat will be different for different circuits, even if they are of the same tier. You can see the heat for individual racks by scanning them. You cannot remove or insert components until the heat is gone. You can see the overall heat value in the controller's interface. And most importantly: DO NOT WRENCH THE COMPUTER RACKS IF THEY HAVE HEAT IN THEM. Otherwise, you're going to get an explosion.%n%nComputation:%nComputation is generated every second and is based on the tier of your circuit. There are, however, differences in between how much computation is generated, even with the same exact tier. For instance, you could use a Master Quantum Computer (Quantum Circuit Series / LuV) or a Wetwareprocessor (Wetware Circuit Series / LuV) which will give you more Computation even though they are of the same tier. If you wish to find out exactly how much Computation a circuit gives; place down a Computer Rack, put a circuit inside and scan it. You can also see the total computation in the controller.%n%nIt will include the following information.%nBase computation: %nAfter overclocking: <same as above unless you specially overclock it>%nHeat Accumulated: <based on circuits and heat vents, keep a watchful eye on this part as it's extremely important>%n%nYou can find an overview of circuits with their maximum heat and Computation generation on the GTNH wiki.%n%nUsing the parameters in the GUI, you can overclock and overvolt the QC but we won't do so for our example setup here.%n%nSending Computation to the Research Station:%nUse the Optical Master Connector in one of the variable spaces on the QC, and the Optical Slave Connector on the RS. Use Optical Fiber Cable to connect them, and make sure to paint all three.%n%nExample setup:%nNow that you've understood the concepts and safety of handling of the QC, what are the more optimal setups for your Quantum Computer? For now, we suggest 2 racks with 3 Ultimate Crystalcomputers each, and of course 1 Advanced Heat Vent. This gives you 156 C/s and will get you started with recipes in the Research Station. This is a rather minimal setup though, you should probably think about more optimized (or just larger) setups later!%n%nNow that you understand the QC, it's time to build it! You'll need to gather quite a lot of resources.

# Quest: Research Station

Once again, using the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector will tell you how to build this Multiblock. There should be 3 empty blocks beneath it so you can see the whole blueprint. Once it is nearly assembled, place down an Energy Hatch, an Optical Slave Connector, and a Maintenance Hatch all on the back side.%n%nOnce fully assembled, you can begin operating recipes at any time, so long as the Quantum Computer is also active and connected. The Research Station requires you to put the item to research within the Object Holder, then a data stick in the Multiblock interface. Once the Computation is fully completed, the data stick that houses all the data of the completed item will be inside the Multiblock Interface.%n%nStill confused? Good, that's the spirit of learning! Always make sure to test these things in creative single player if you wish to find exact measurements and such. Don't forget to ALWAYS COLOR THE OPTICAL HATCHES AND FIBERS!%n%n§3Note that some researches require a significant amount of amps, so keep that in mind.§r

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a5b.desc=In order to make Wetware circuits, you'll need Sterilized Growth Medium and Stemcells, so let's get started on those, ok?%n%nTo get anywhere, first you need Bacteria. You can get this through the vat or the brewing machine. Vat way is more efficient, but you need culture for it so you first need to do brewing way. Vat needs Bismuth rods for radiation and EV-tier glass. There are also 3 recipes, so you can use a higher tier one later if you like.%n%nYou'll also need Mince Meat and Agar. You'll want a stable supply of meat, so something like the a fish farm, a standard animal farm, or IC2 Meatrose or Goldfish is probably best.%n%nAgar has a more complicated processing chain, but it's nothing compared to Platinum. You'll need even more meat for it.%n%nUse some of the Bacteria to create an Ova Evolutionis culture (15%% chance), and then use that in the vat's controller to make Raw Growth Medium. You'll need IV-tier glass, and Uranium rods. There are also higher tier recipes.%n%n§3Cultures are not consumed when used in the vat.

You only need one per Vat, but they're consumed when making DNA Samples, so you should probably learn how.%n%nTo start off, you'll need to get an eColi Culture.%n%nUse that to make the eColi Bacteria Fluid.§3 (I know the name is completely different, deal with it)§r%n%nCentrifuge that to make Liquid DNA.%n%nAnd combine it with Radon in the Mixer to make FluorecentdDNA.%n%neColi Bacteria Fluid can also be Centrifuged for Plasma Membranes (10%% chance) and EnzymesSollution, so do that as well.%n%nAnd then Centrifuge the EnzymesSollution again for Polymerase.%n%nYou should expect to need a significant amount of eColi Bacteria Fluid if you plan on copying a lot of cultures, or making the hard to make ones.%n%n§3To search for items related to copying cultures, search for 'culture', 'dna sample', or 'plasmid'. You can't do this for the Data Orbs, you have to check the uses of DNA Samples.%n%n§5A bunch of the fluids have incorrect spelling, don't blame me for it.

# Quest: DNA Samples for Copying Cultures

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a98.desc=To copy cultures, you'll need to make a DNA sample first. Many of these have low chances, but this one's 100%%. I'm sure you can figure it out yourself, but keep in mind that the Modules are not consumed, and that you may wish to use one of the IC2 Crops for the Detergent materials.

# Quest: Data Orbs for Copying Cultures

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a9a.desc=To copy a culture, you'll need%n1) A Sterilized Petri Dish%n2) A Plasma Membrane (made from Stemcells, or gotten while making EnzymesSollution)%n3) Stemcells%n4) A Data Orb with the appropriate data on it%n5) Liquid DNA%n6) A LuV Bio Lab%n7) A Clonal Cellular Synthesis Module%n%nYou can change out the Data Orb for one with whatever culture you wish to copy. Keep in mind that it might be easier to make a second culture the normal way, and that there's generally an alternative recipe that uses the fluid it produces to make it with a higher chance.%n%nPS: This recipe is the only one in NEI that uses this module, so you can find it if you look, but the number will change, so I can't specify which page.

# Quest: General Purpose Fermenting Bacteria

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a9b.desc=So if you looked in NEI and tried to figure out how to make this, you were probably confused by the fact that you use the fluid it produces to make it. This is where NEI is lying to you. Like the previous recipe, NEI doesn't show it correctly (they should be around the same page in NEI, they both also appear to produce Sterilized Petri Dishes, (even if that's not true) and both use unique Modules).%n%nIn order to make this, you'll need to make the Rotten Flesh Bacteria culture, get the DNA Sample, and then get the Data Orb. It changes it's name to beta-Lactamase, that's normal.%n%nThen, do the same thing for Common Yeast (get the right Yeast!).%n%nThen you need to use the recipe to combine the information from the Data Orbs and get the Common Yeast Plasmid from that.%n%nLastly, use the Rotten Flesh Bacteria culture, the Common Yeast Plasmid, Penicillin (make it by centrifuging Common Yeast Fluid), and Distilled Water. You want the Transformation Module for this. It's a 100%% chance.%n%nYou'll want to use the normal recipe to make more cultures, since it also becomes beta-Lactamase once you turn it into a DNA Sample.

Carbon ones can be made in an assembly line, but very inefficiently. There must be a better way.%n%nWhat about a Nano Forge, able to cut up blocks into nano-thin sheets and then creating the first nanite, which helps create thousands of them in mere seconds.%n%n§3The Nano Forge is a big multiblock requiring lots of power over the course of a couple minutes. It is able to use TT energy hatches (including lasers). The controller must have a carbon nanite to use tier 1 recipes.%n%nDespite what NEI might claim there are no minimum voltages for the Nano Forge recipes. If you want to do a recipe you just have to achieve the raw EU/t required, no matter the voltage.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a8b.desc=So if you thought one Quantum Computer was cool, what about two? You can chain them to get more computing power for your research by connecting them with Optical Connectors the same way you connect to the Research Station. The original QC should have the slave to receive the data from the second one.%n%nOf course, this is kinda expensive, so there's actually another option, and that's to simply extend the first one. You can tear down the last two columns of blocks and then use an itemstack of two hologram projectors to see how a 4 computer rack one would be built. However, you'll need another UV or higher hatch to power it if you use 4 racks, since that will use 5A. You can do the same for up to a 12 stack for 24 computer racks if you want. Just add more of the middle slice, or let a larger stack of hologram projectors show you how it's done.%n%nIf you use 3 racks with 3 Crystalprocessor Mainframes and 1 Advanced Heat Vent each, you'll have enough for the UEV circuit, and it won't overheat either.%n%nA third option for higher computation needs is to finally go back and learn how to set parameters in a useful way. That gives you finer control over the maximum heat your QC reaches and get everything out of it.%n%n§4Remember to let all the heat in your QCs dissipate before changing things.

It can be equipped with Space Elevator modules, which then can take on different tasks. %n%nInitially, your Space Elevator has 6 module slots that can be used. You can later upgrade that to up to 12 with Mk-II and Mk-III motors. The motor tier also determines the module tier that you can use. The I/O is not shared between modules, each module only sees their own I/O slots. Energy is only provided to the central structure of the Space Elevator and then automatically distributed to all modules.%n%nAfter a module has been inserted and supplied with the right I/O, it can be configured further using parameters.%n%nYou can see in NEI which fluids are pumpable with the Space Pumping Module. It consumes 1A UHV to work. The Gas Type and Planet Type are parameters.%n%nNEI also has an overview of all the ores you can obtain with a Space Mining Module. It needs to supplied with a drone, which will act as catalyst, a set of input items, computation and either Helium, Bismuth or Radon plasma. The plasma will boost both the recipe time and the amount of bonus stacks you get out of a recipe. With its parameters you can adjust parallels, overdrive, and distance. When multiple recipes have the same input and you have the distance set to a value that they share, the module will pick a random one, taking the recipes weights into consideration.%n%nThe space elevator also lets you travel to other planets. It doesn't get you back though and there is no documentation. So best find out yourself how it works.%n%nThe mining module also got a cycle mode.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a88.desc=To make living solder for your UEV components or bio-circuits, you will need a chem plant with Rugged Botmium Casings. These are not easy to make!%n%nYou can certainly figure out the rest by now, but the Advanced Nitinol may confuse you. You make it out of blocks of Nitinol 60 with a Quantum Anomaly in a Laser Engraver. This means you need to make a UV Cyclotron, and hit several low chances in a row, so good luck with that!

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a61.name=It's Not Going Bad, I Swear!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a61.desc=To make your next tier of circuits (Bio Circuits), you need to make Raw Bio Medium. There are three ways of making it.%n%nThe first one requires Stemcells, Unknown Crystal and T-Ceti Seaweed Extract at LuV voltage and 94 Sievert (Plutonium level) in a Bacterial Vat. It makes Raw Bio Medium at 4:1 ratio.%n%nThe second one is basically the first one, but it requires Infinity Catalyst instead of Tritanium at ZPM voltage and 140 Sievert (Enriched Naquadah level) in a Bacterial Vat. It makes Raw Bio Medium at 1:1 ratio.%n%nThe third one is the most efficient, but it requires Biocells (which you don't have yet), and 4 dust of Infinity Catalyst at UV voltage and 150 Sievert (Naquadria level) in a Bacterial Vat. It makes Raw Bio Medium at 1:2 ratio.%n%n§3The second and third ways use a different culture.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a79.desc=So you probably noticed that the amount of seaweed you'll need to make Bio circuits is kind of...intense. Collecting them yourself is a huge pain, and who wants to program robots? Plus servers. Fortunately, there's now a way to make seaweed.%n%nThe first thing you need is...Seaweed! Use that with Unknown Water you pumped from the same planet to make the culture. Expect this to take a while, as the chances are super low. You'll also need the max tier Bio Lab.%n%nOnce you have the culture you can make SeaweedBroth, by combining it with UnknownNutrientAgar and some other stuff. This can then be made into seaweed.

The recipe is similar to the General Purpose one. Remember that all recipes in this chain are low probablility recipes.%n%nYour first step is to make the Barnardafis culture, then the DNA Sample, and then the Data Orb. If you didn't grab the saplings and dirt previously (to grow more trees for logs), head back to Barnarda C.%n%nUse the same recipe as for the General Purpose one, but use the Data Orb for Barnardafis instead of Common Yeast. You should get the Barnardafis Plasmid.%n%nAgain, it's the same recipe for the next step, but with the TCetiEis Fucus Serratus culture and the Barnardafis Plasmid, this should produce the Xenoxene Xenoxis culture. It's a 7.5%% chance.%n%nYou should probably use the normal alternative recipe to make more cultures, since it's easy to fail copying it too.%n%nYou should be able to figure out yourself how to make Xenoxene once you have the culture.%n%n%n§3After many years, the transformation recipe now even has NEI support!

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cb1.desc=Let's make a brand new plastic! The trees that you found on Barnada C have very interesting properties. Still, you can't just use the extracted radox substance raw. Some serious refining steps are in order!%n%n§6You'll need it for a ton of stuff like UIV and UMV superconductors, UEV+ hatches, or parts of the Dyson Swarm.§r%n%nCompared to the previous plastics, most of the steps required here are not chemical reactions. They are also very slow, so you might want to use a mega multiblock to help with that. This production line also underlines the necessity of large-scale plasma production. You will only need more going forward.%n%n§3The Heavy Radox you get as a byproduct can be used for MkV Naquadah Fuel.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ccc.desc=With the Nano Forge built, we can upgrade our production of circuit boards for free, but the nanites need a container to hold them. The current casings aren't enough, we need to find an alternative casing.%n%nAfter some research, infinity as a frame and enriched holmium as the protection layer seems to work well. It can be allowed to let through nanites to go into the printer base so that extra material can be directly removed instead of trying to go slower.%n%n§3Allows the player to use the tier 2 recipes with the use of a silver nanite in the input bus.%nThis also unlocks parallels of the PCB Factory with said formula: Log2(x) parallels, where x is the amount of nanites in the input bus.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002ce.desc=If you ever wanted to know how crop breeding works you are in the right place. Get some crops (the sticks) and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. %n%nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdWdFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd %nFFFdddFFF%nNow place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.%n%nWhen they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.%n%nWith some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.%n%nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.%n%nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds. %n%nIf you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.%n%nNote that the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.%n%nDon't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing. %n%nCrossing happens when 2 or more almost mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a high chance of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation. More details in the IC2 cropnalyzer quest.

# Quest: Analyze Your Crops
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000605.name=Analyze Your Crops
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000605.desc=The cropnalyzer is a powered tool used to analyze IC2 crop seedbags. Charge it by placing it in an MV machine; recommended to put an MV battery in it as well to keep it full. To fully analyze a seed bag, you will need to put it through the cropnalyzer four times. If the crop is already planted, it is better to analyze it with the portable scanner instead of breaking it just to scan it - you have a chance of losing the seed every time you break it.%n%nThe cropnalyzer also has a feature called the IC2 Crop Calculator, where you can find the mix of outputs of breeding together any crops. To access the calculator, hit the IC2 side inventory key while holding the cropnalyzer.  You can select any crops available and discover what plants have decent percentages of a result. And no, you can't do the reverse, search for the crops.zip on discord for that (it doesn't have micadia though).%n%nYou can choose up to four crops to breed together. Then click "process" and the bottom row will show the possible crossbreeding outputs, and their weights. You can use the + and - gui buttons to scroll through the row(s) of crops. You can also use a button in the GUI to sort the rows by tier or weight. You can invert the sorting by hitting the sorting button while holding shift.%n%nWhen trying to get a specific crop, you generally want to maximize its percentage. Do this by breeding 2-4 of the same plant together (more is faster). There is no advantage to crossing plant types, it just reduces the %% chance of getting what you want, contrary to what you might think.%n%nUse the crops guide at https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-Crops for more details.%n%nA large field of stickreeds has a good chance at making lots of valuable crosses. This is because it's decently high tier (they randomly mutate to tiers nearby mostly), and it's really fast, so you can get it to a high stat fast, which you should probably do first. Mutations are random, you can get transformium from stickreed, so keep that in mind. You do tend to get similar crops, so if you want metals, get the metal crops for example. Go to the wiki or spreadsheet (not up to date) to see the attributes that govern similarity.

# Quest: Crop Stats

Specifically, it increases the growth points your crop gets per growth tick. If it gets to 24+, your crop acts like a weed, so most people say to stay at 23 or less. However, it will only weed other crops under certain conditions.%n%n1) Is in a cardinal direction on the same Y level. 2) Will only affect dirt/grass, or cropsticks or crops 3) If there's a crop there that is §oalso§r a weed, if it's at a maturity level > 1, it §owon't affect it§r 4) If it affects the crop, it'll be replaced with a normal weed%n%n§9Gain§r:%nInfluences chances of how many drops you get, and whether you get any at all. 31 is the best for sure.%n%n§eResistance§r:%nThis stat is responsible for a couple of crops' properties: chances for getting a seed while punching crop, resistance of your crop to trampling (jumping on it), decreases chance of crop dying due to lack of enviromental stats, and resistance of crop to weed spread. It also reduces mutation chance as it goes up (apparently). Aim for around 10 for balance.

They're also affected by the Fertilizer and Water stats.%n%nNutrients and Humidity are mostly about the right biome, with swamp and rainforest types (hot+humid) being the best, but you can also get some extra stats by setting up right.%n%n§2Nutrients§r:%n3 possible free points from dirt under the farmland block, 2 for plants that require a specific block. So optimally always make sure that the required block is at the bottommost bottom in the column, because it checks in chain, not certain height. For example: cropstick -> farmland -> dirt -> oreblock -> dirt, it will only register 1 dirt, ignoring the one below the oreblock.%n%n5-10 possible points from fertilizing your crops. You can use fertilizer on a crop to increase its nutrients stat. Fertilizer caps at 199 which gives 10 nutrients, but can be applied again only if the crop drops below 100 fertilizer points. So for high stat crops its safe to assume and make tests for 100 fertilizer points as its a given constant unlike 199->100 values. You can apply bonemeal, IC2 fertilizer and Forestry fertilizer to a crop by hand. Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron does this automatically when supplied with fertilizer (the multifarm needs fertilizer to harvest crops as well).%n%n§1Humidity§r:%n2 free points from using dirt as farmland, as when farmland gets hydrated by water(turns darker) it gains 2 humidity points. This is why other blocks for this suck, since they don't give this bonus.%n%n10 possible points from hydrating your crop. Similiar to fertilizing, water can be applied to crop up to 200 points, which is 10 humidity points, altough unlike fertilizer it does not need to drop below value of 100, water can be applied over and over keeping it at constant 200 points. You can apply water to your crop by using IC2 hydration cells by hand, or let your Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron do it automatically. The multifarm needs water to harvest crops as well though.%n%n§6Air Quality§r:%n4 potential free points from empty space around crop. A crop checks for empty spaces to calculate bonus air quality points, it gives up to 4 points, 1 point for each 2 empty spaces. It only counts full blocks or cropsticks though. If you like looks, you'll probably have to sacrifice this.%n%n4 free points from height of your farm. You get 1 free point every 15 blocks startng at Y79.%n79 - 1 point%n94 - 2 points%n109 - 3 points%n124 - 4 points%n%n2 free points from no opaque blocks above the crop. You can place glass above and you won't lose the bonus since it's a transparent block. You cannot use dark glass, several layers of water, or gaseous tenebrae to get around this if your crop likes the dark. Unless you only let it grow at night I guess§..%n%n§aGrowability§r:%nYour crop will require a certain level of NHA, try to reach or surpass this, or the crop will either not grow, or even die (disappear). Each crop is different, and higher tiers (and stats) require more. It's generally easy to meet though, as long as you're in a good biome.%n%nGrowability is determined by the difference between what the crop needs in terms of NHA, and what it actually has. If you have more than what you need it grows faster. This is why you don't want a maxed resistance stat, since higher stats will slow it down.

Using §4left-click§r when §9immature§r will result in nothing.%n%nIf it's §amature§r, use §6left-click§r to have a higher chance of a seed dropping. Using §4right-click§r when §amature§r will result in lower seed drops than punching it normally.%n%nKeep in mind that the higher the tier/stats of the crop, the lower the chances. By a lot.%n%n§3The formula is 1+tanh((-1)(X+5((-Re/2)+Gr+Ga)/21)/12); X=0 to 16%n%nWhere Re, Gr, Ga are respectively Resistance, Growth and Gain stat of the crop, and X is tier.

To open the rest of the questline, you will need to do Thaumcraft quests and research the Witchery tab in the Thaumonomicon.%n%nAccording to legend, when the root of the Mandrake plant is dug up it screams and kills all who hear it. This is only partially true. A fully grown Mandrake may scream causing immense discomfort to those around. This is why it is best to harvest the Mandrake root at night when the plant is more likely to be dormant. The fully grown Mandrake can be harvested to obtain more Mandrake seeds and a Mandrake.%n%nBreaking a fully grown Mandrake plant will either yield Mandrake Root or the Mandrake may awaken and cause all sorts of mischief (and pain to the ears!).%n%nBelladonna seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage belladonna plant.

Which may either be replanted, or used in a crafting recipe.%n%nGarlic bulbs can be used to make meaty stew, a particularly nourishing meal. It is also the main ingredient in making a Garlic Garland, a useful tool in warding off vampires. Finally, garlic can be used by witches in a Witches' Cauldron to make a vampire Weakening brew, and by Witch Hunters, to make vampire resistant armor.%n%nWolfsbane seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Wolfsbane plant.

With §3UV§r glass you can have an energy tier as high as you want.%nShift click with screwdriver to change crop type (IC2/normal), sadly you can't farm both in one machine.%nThere are 3 modes to manage your crops (change with screwdriver):%n%n§lSetup mode (input):%n§rIn this mode you can plant your crops in the machine.%nJust put them in the input bus and enable the machine with a soft mallet.%nAdditionally, you need to insert block that is required for IC2 crop to grow (if any)%nWhen the bus is empty, just disable it and change the mode.%nKeep in mind that there is limited space of slots for your crops depending on the voltage.%nWith normal crops you start with 1 slot and that multiplies by 2 every tier past §5EV§r, every slot can take 64 crops of the same type.%nWith IC2 crops you start with 4 slots and that multiplies by 4 every tier past §dLuV§r, every slot can take only 1 crop.%n%n§lSetup mode (output):%n§rThis mode allows you to move your Greenhouse or upgrade your crops.%nWhen the machine is running in this mode it will output all planted crops in the output bus.%n%n§lNormal operation:%n§rWith normal crops it is a straightforward process. Base processing time is 5 seconds, at the end of operation all crops are grown and the outputs are added to the output bus. Additionally the time is lower every tier past §5EV§r §o(The time is divided by the number of tiers past §6HV§r§o, minimum 1 second. WOW) §r%n%nIC2 crops on the other hand, are not that easy. They are normally simulated, but accelerated 32 times. Process time is 5 seconds. You can check the progress of the growing process with a tricorder.%n%nIf you want to grow your crops even faster, then you can use a fertilizer (up to §l400%% more drops§r !). Machine will take fertilizer from the input busses on start of the operation and will be applied to that operation only. Each fetilizer gives +200%% per crop in normal mode or +10%% in IC2 mode. The bonus is applied evenly on crops. Examples:%nNormal mode, 3 wheat seeds, 1 tea seeds, you insert 1 fertilizer, you will get +150%% wheat drops and +50%% tea drops.%nIC2 mode, 16 melon seed bags, you insert 64 fetilizer, you will get +40%% drops.%n%nAdditionally, all your crops need water to grow. Every single crop drinks 1000L per operation. So for example if you have planted 576 tea seeds at §3UV§r voltage you will need 576000 L per second.%n%n§lLast notes:%n§rThe animation can’t be disabled.%nThe lamps can be inverted.%nThe dirt must be tilled.%nIf you encounter any issue or have any suggestion please open an issue on github and ping §l@kuba6000§r.%nThis MB was created to farm tea because I wanted to.%n

It will hopefully drop itself once you crash, which is slightly nicer than the usual sticks. That's all well and good, but what if we utilize the electric engine? Wearing an energy storage device in your chestplate slot, like a batpack or energypack, will cause the boat to drain energy from it and propel you forward at supersonic speed! Doing this will consume about 100 EU per block traveled, so even a decent batpack won't last long!

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000870.desc=Yet another custom block system! Carpenter's blocks are crafted blank and placed in-world, and then plain block textures applied to them. The blocks must not be Tile Entities, so Botany blocks don't work correctly with them, but GT Stones like Red Granite, and any colored clay or vanilla glass block will work. Some Chisel glass types will work, and Ztones blocks and Tinted Glass also work.%n%nThe Garage Door requires a block at the top to hang "down" from, but can pretty much be any length.  A redstone signal on any block next to the Garage Door blocks will open or close the door. The open/close will propagate across multiple vertical doors, so you can setup non-square doors. Sneaking and right-clicking with an empty hand will change the door's polarity.%n%nThe pressure plates are player-only activation, making them great for doors into your base.%n%nThe hatches must be clicked on the side of a block to place. They can be handy for protecting you from crucible...byproducts.%n %nThere is a lot more block shapes possible, check NEI for "Carpenter's" to see the options.%n%nThe Chisel allows you to chisel blocks while attached to a Carpenter's block.%n%nThe Hammer allows various functions.%n%nHammer on door - changes door shape type%nSneak Hammer on door - Changes from iron to wooden behavior%nSneak Hammer on lever - Changes polarity (which direction is on/off)

# Quest: Catwalks

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cde.desc=The Catwalks Mod adds several cosmetic blocks to deck out your factory.%n%nScaffolds and Builder's Scaffolds are useful for building up in the air before you get access to flight. They can be climbed like ladders, and break instantly when punched. You will also not fall off of them if you let go of movement keys while climbing. If you right-click the Builder's Scaffold with a solid block, the scaffold will be replaced by that block.%n%nCatwalks can connect to each other to form a wide passageway. You can decorate them by attaching Caution Tape or Rope Lights, the latter provide dim lighting.%n%nCaged Ladders give you a way to move up and down without a risk of falling off. Climbing them is much faster than vanilla ladders.%n%nSupport Columns are purely decorative. They connect to each other in all directions. They also work as ladders.%n%nSturdy Rails let you run minecart tracks across gaps without supports. Right-click the Sturdy Powered Rail with a Blowtorch to power it permanently, you don't need a redstone torch. If you don't have enough distractions already, use them to build a rollercoaster!%n%nThe Blowtorch lets you remove railings or even the floor from a catwalk by right-clicking. Use it to make an opening to let you walk onto the catwalk, or if you don't know what an "OSHA violation" is. The same function can be performed by a GT or Forge-compatible wrench, so you don't actually need to make this.%n

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000242.desc=The carpenter is similar to an automatic crafting table. It has an item input slot and a storage slot for the recipes. Some recipes need an additional fluid like water, creosote, honey or molten redstone. With the carpenter you can make farmblocks, woven backpacks, bee and tree analysers and many more.%n%nThe carpenter needs power to work. You can use a GT cable or a battery box to connect to the machine or make some forestry, railcraft or buildcraft RF engines.%n%n§3PS: Yes it's a pain in the ass to automate, just make one for each thing you want to make.

It requires redstone flux (RF) energy to run.%n%nIt is your first machine made in the carpenter. Once warmed up, it needs to maintain a certain heat level to operate. The amount of power supplied will determine how much heat will be generated. If you do not supply enough power to maintain the current temperature it will slowly drop. It will continuously draw power, so disconnect it if you don't need it.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000246.desc=The smallest farm you can build requires 36 farm blocks (3x4x3 - the largest is 5x4x5 or 100 farm blocks). Place the underlying blocks corresponding to the farm type you built. In this case, Stone Bricks. You can place these blocks beside or under the multi structure, but not the layer above. It will search 6 blocks above these for dirt/farmland/sand/soul sand/humus depending on farm type, with the appropriate crops, saplings, etc on top of that. %n%nYou can use different modes to collect different crops. Arboretum for trees, infernal for nether wart and so on. You can even mix and match modes on the same farm - cutting trees down for wood in part, and collecting fruit from trees without destroying it in another, for example. So long as they're on different sides, at least.%n%n§YYou may need to experiment a bit to see what works, but https://ftbwiki.org/MultiFarm#Managed_Farms has a decent list, though it doesn't specify cotton for managed crop farms for example. It might be a GTNH change, I dunno. A number of crops have an added IC2 crop version as well, so you may prefer those for the higher yield if you level them up. Orchard mode works with Pam's, and Witchery, just to save you some time. Pam's nether crops however don't seem to work at all though.

# Quest: Changing Your Foresty Circuit Configuration

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000248.desc=The (forestry) soldering iron is a tool used for attaching electron tubes to circuit boards in order to manipulate how an electrical engine works or to program multifarms, as well as upgrading the squeezer or centrifuge. Honestly, you'll probably only use it for the multifarm though.%n%nOnce electron tubes have been attached to a circuit board they cannot be removed, only replaced. The circuit board is automatically crafted as soon as the basic recipe requirements are met, so it's best practice to first place your electron tubes and then add the circuit board.%n%nThe soldering iron can also be used to remove the circuit board from electrical engines, multifarms, squeezers and centrifuges by opening the machine's GUI and left clicking with the soldering iron on the circuit board slot.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000250.desc=To power your farm and have it automatically harvest crops, you will need at least one farm gearbox to supply power. You can use either RF or EU. If you use EU, make sure to use a cable to allow conversion. Farm operations can be hastened with additional gearboxes.%n%nTesting has shown that splitting the amps to 4 gearboxes (4A ULV) works better than sending 1A LV to 4 gearboxes.%n%nA max sized IC2 Crop farm (5x4x5) using all space possible with max stat seeds (31/31/0) on a fast crop needs only 6A ULV to keep up.%n%nSimilarly, a max sized small farm (3x4x3) using all space possible with max stat seeds (31/31/0) on a high tier, moderate speed crop needs only 4A ULV.%n%nSending more power to the same gearbox doesn't work. If it can get to max RF capacity but your farm can't keep up, sending more power won't help, so add more gearboxes.%n%nIn addition, you lose 2 EU from the the energy emitting device for every A of ULV (which is only 8 to begin with), so it's not nearly as efficient as using LV or higher. Just keep in mind that more A to more gearboxes is better than to the same one.%n%nOf course, if you mix your slower crops with your faster ones, you aren't likely to need to min-max to this extent.

Get the U-238 from thorium, and the endereyes from either your crops, villagers, or the normal way in HV. It also only searches 6 blocks above the farm structure block to prevent lag. So goodbye MF stacking, you always looked dumb, and didn't make any sense.%n%nThe largest size supports ~1100 crops, while the smallest supports ~600 depending on your layout if you use it for IC2 crops. This is because it will look for crops up to 5 blocks out further than normal in this mode (In the cardinal directions, it's further out in the corners. Just try it out, it's hard to describe). They're the same size as in previous versions, so you don't need to rejigger them.%n

Once you get a tree with a useful attribute, you can breed that attribute into other tree species. This way you can get an ultimate tree that combines all the attributes you want - including the type of fruit! you can also extract the genes with Gendustry if you can make the machines.%n%nIT IS RECOMMENDED YOU DO YOUR FORESTRY TREE BREEDING IN AN ENCLOSED AREA, OR UNDERGROUND. BUTTERFLIES ARE A KNOWN LAG SOURCE.%n%nFor faster tree breeding, enclose your trees so that butterflies cannot escape, and breed bees with better traits for area and pollination speed. There's also frames too if you can afford it. The sieve may also help if you want to do it more exactly if you can make an alveary. §3PS: You need either bees or butterflies, trees won't pollinate each other. §r%n%n§eSaplings/Fertility§r: Chance of getting a sapling from a detroyed leaf. Good for making into biomass or other uses. Balsa, Gooseberry and Sweetgum are what you want.%n%nAllele     Drop Chance%nLowest   1%%%nLower    2.5%%%nLow       3.5%%%nAverage 5%%%nHigh      10%%%n%n§cMaturation/Matures§r: The growth speed of a sapling into a tree. Important if you plan to cut it down right away for logs. Golden Rasperry is the fastest.%n%nAllele    Time%nSlowest  10%nSlower   7%nSlow      5%nAverage 4%nFast      3%nFaster   2 %nFastest  ?%n%n§dHeight§r: Controls how high the tree grows.

Wider trees have more leaves and logs, but will also need more saplings to begin growing. All saplings must be the same species and girth. The sapling in the NW corner determines the stats of the new tree, and is where bone meal must be applied to mature the tree. The Giant Sequoia is best here too.%n%nAllele/Size%n1x1%n2x2%n3x3%n4x4 %n%nYield: Chances of getting a fruit from a destroyed leaf.

Boost Fermenter output more using honey or fruit juice. Blue Mahoe and Red Maple are the best. §3NEI doesn't show recipes for analyzed saplings in the fermenter (and maybe hybrids, I dunno).§r%n%nAllele  Biomass (forestry)%nLowest   100mB%nLower    200mB%nLow       300mB%nAverage 400mB%nHigh       600mB %n%n§4Fireproof§r: Kind of obvious. Applies to the wood. Only the Coast and Giant Sequoia have this.%n%n§7Effect§r: All trees are None.%n%n========================================================================%n%n§2Growth§r: Sipiri trees have Tropical instead of Light, and can only be bred in a Biome with temperature 90%%-190%% and humidity 90%%-200%% and can only grow in 120%%-190%% temp and 90%%-200%% humidity. All other trees just need light to grow.%n%n§3Territory/Soil§r: All trees have Average, whatever that means. Probably something related to the below that never really got used.%n%n§eTolerates§r: If it can be planted on sand or not. Only Desert Acacia and Grandidier's Baobab have this. The trait is either Plains or Plains, Desert.%n%n§5Supports§r: What kind of fruits it can theoretically have. Determined by Species. Only fruits from families listed under this trait can be produced by the tree, regardless of what appears under the tree's §aFruits§r trait. There's a number of Extra Trees trees that support all 4 types, but none from Forestry itself.%n%n§aFruit§r: Determines what fruit or nut it produces. Each fruit/nut provides different advantages:%nPlum and Cherry Plum only produces 100L Fruit Juice, but have a 60%% chance of producing Mulch in the Fluid Extractor or Squeezer.%nPapaya produces 600L Fruit Juice, but only has a 10%% chance to produce Mulch.%nCoconuts produce 300L Seed Oil, but only have a 25%% chance to produce Mulch.%nUse a forestry Multifarm so you don't have to break the leaf block to get the fruit/nut. Set it to Manual Orchard, and place everything first.%n%n§bFamily§r: Tells you what family of the fruit listed under the Fruits trait is: Pomes, Prunes, Nuts or Jungle.%n%n§4When breeding these trees for quests, you will need to breed the species "pure", not a hybrid. Fortunately, that's much easier for trees. You should probably save the crossbreeding 'till after you get all the good ones.

# Quest: Collecting the Hybrids
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000824.name=Collecting the Hybrids
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000824.desc=If you got lucky and found some bees in a village, put them in their houses next to some trees. Over time the bees will slowly pollinate the leaves of the trees. Using a grafter you can break the leaf blocks to retrieve a sapling 100%%, useful for getting the forestry saplings. This doesn't seem to work with magical trees though. You can trade with villagers to get proven grafters that have a longer lifetime. Also investigate magic, you have heard rumors of long lasting grafters available to magicians. %n%nGregTech also offers a really nice tool, the Branch Cutter.

# Quest: Better Grafter Through Technology
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000849.name=Better Grafter Through Technology

# Quest: Speak For the Trees
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000084a.name=Speak For the Trees
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000084a.desc=You'll need to find a bunch of vanilla trees to start your breeding program. To convert them directly to Forestry trees, you can use a Treealyzer - but you'll need a carpenter and aluminium from MV for that. Alternatively, you can just grow a bunch of vanilla trees and surround them by good pollination bees in bee housing. Spectacles will help you see the fertilized leaves to harvest with your Grafter or Branch Cutter.%n%nCompleting the quests will require scanned trees, but you can progress on breeding while waiting for your GT Scanner or Treealyzer to be made.

# Quest: Seeing the Fruits of Your Labor
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000825.name=Seeing the Fruits of Your Labor

# Quest: BEGONE, LAG! Also, Bats
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ad4.name=BEGONE, LAG! Also, Bats
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ad4.desc=Lag = Butterflies in this case, since they like to pile up just outside of chunk loading range. Also, they're annoying since they convert regular trees into more forestry ones, one leaf block at a time. Which causes more of the buggers to spawn. Fortunately, the settings we use prevent too many from being present at once, but still, they're annoying.%n%nThe solution to this is to kill them. Also, the bats. Stupid Thaumcraft warp. Use the (potentially unfinished) Pest Killer to do so.%n%nNotes: Hydrogen Cyanide has a recipe now. Both it and Formaldehyde require a Chemical Plant. It doesn't appear to use any of the Formaldehyde up though. The range is apparently 5x5 chunks, not blocks. It also only runs once every 30s or so?%n%n§3PS: If you experience problems using it (more than already mentioned), raise a ticket on github.

You can put an output fluid hatch to the top layer of the EBF to collect it otherwise it gets auto voided. It depends on the muffler hatch how much fluid you can recover. Bart's Platinum Series recipes output fluids on the BOTTOM, so if you want to do Platinum Stuff later, remember that.%n%nMoron always says - Make Muffler Moint Mup. Or point up, anyways.%n%nIf you want a really fancy EBF, you can add more input fluid hatches and store different fluids in each one.%n%nThe EBF also has a heat adjustment of 100K for each power tier above or below MV. You can only make LV energy hatches right now, but installing two LV energy hatches will overclock the EBF to MV power, eliminating the 100K penalty and setting the initial heat to 1801K.%n%nAs you upgrade your EBF over the course of the game, this heat adjustment will increase. Two MV energy hatches (overclocking to HV) will add +100K, two HV energy hatches (overclocking to EV) will give +200K, and so on.

# Quest: §6§lCleanroom
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000003ac.name=§6§lCleanroom
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000003ac.desc=If you want to make more advanced (also cheaper!) circuits you'll need a cleanroom. The cleanroom is a multiblock between 3x4x3 and 15x15x15 (WxHxL) blocks. Besides plascrete blocks for all edges you'll need a controller in the top center, filter machine casings for the rest of the top except edges, an energy and a maintenance hatch. You will also need a reinforced door or some other way to get in and out and machine hulls or diodes if you want to automate it. The door, machine hulls, and diodes are optional. You can use the machine hulls for power input, item input, and item output. Tier does not affect item transfer, so use the cheapest ones for that.%n%nLet's build a 5x5x5 room. Expanding it vertically is easy to do, or you can make it wider and longer, as long as both X and Z match and are odd. Up to around 5%% of the plascrete blocks can be replaced with Reinforced Glass to see into the cleanroom and check on machines. Some other glass like Borosilicate Glass or Warded Glass can be used in even higher percentages.%n%nYou can pass materials through the walls using Machine Hulls. You can pass 1A of power using a Machine Hull as well, or you can use Diodes to pass multiple amps through.%n%nJust be really careful when upgrading your machines to a higher voltage. Be sure to remove the machine hulls and diodes and replace them with the new power tier, or else you will be very sad. You don't need to do this for ones you only use to pass items through.%n%nIf the Cleanroom has maintenance issues, it will have a chance to void recipes needing a cleanroom (10%% per maint issue!). Monitor your cleanroom with a Hand Scanner, Industrial Information Panel, or using a Needs Maintenance Cover and a Redstone Powered Light or Howler Alarm.%n%nAdditionally, the longer the door is open or the cleanroom is off, the lower the efficiency will get, which has a direct correlation to recipe voiding. So open the door as little as possible and keep the cleanroom running! There are ways around using a door though. With an elevator or travel anchor you never actually need to open a door or even use one in the structure! You can even use the elevator block or travel anchor as a floor block to neatly integrate it.%n%n§3Multiblocks such as the LCR, LPF, or PA count as cleanrooms, so you don't need to put them in one. You cannot use the bio lab in a PA, so you'll still need the cleanroom later on.%n%nOther helpful hints include: using a wireless connector for AE or a transvector interface to skip machine hulls, and that you can use higher tier energy hatches to reach 100%% efficiency faster (does not use more power once at 100%%).%n%n§cKeep in mind that you cannot use anything in the cleanroom that causes pollution or it will break down.

This manual covers common problems encountered when using the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace.%n%nSetup%nWhen setting up your EBF, make sure to place it a few chunks away from things pollution affects, like farmland. Pollution is nobody's friend!%n%nDuring setup, make sure the center of the EBF is hollow. Sometimes things can sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft light orb!%n%nMake sure your muffler faces §lout§r, not §lin§r. The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those delightful odors!%n%nWhen placing your power hatches, make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF. Especially at LV, those few blocks make a big difference! Every amp of energy travelling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to get longer running time until you get stable power.%n%nOutput hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and inventories placed next to them such as chests or BC tanks. They will also void if they're full, so keep an eye on them!%n%nWhen building multiple EBFs, the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace can share walls. This can save you on input and output hatches too. Not recommended for energy and maintenance hatches!

If you only want one (for the microprocessors for example), just divide by 4.%n%nAssuming you got the necessary imprints on the LuV tab, you can now craft the CALs for the crystalprocessor series. We're starting with 4 since you'll need one per circuit, the imprint is not removable. And yes this means you need one for every circuit type you want to make with the CAL.%n%nAs an Assembly Line, it generally works like the normal one, with different items in each bus, but since it's only one item per CAL, it's far easier to use, and the recipe is cheaper too.%n%nThe CAL uses 'wraps' to make 16 of a circuit at a time (aside from ULV and LV circuits), saving you time, EU, and Soldering Alloy (or Indalloy). You make the wraps in an Assembler with 16 of the item and Polyethylene.%n%n§3BTW you can change out the Hatches and Busses for better ones, but you still need to keep ingredient order. Also CAL grants perfect overclock.

It will also pre-macerate your ores and give you a little bonus crushed ores as well.%n%nHigher tiers of power will drill faster. You need to upgrade the energy hatch corresponding to the power tier. You will also need an energy hatch, an input hatch, and an output bus - at least MV but you can choose.%n%nLater you can upgrade the ore drilling plant so it extracts from more than a 48 block radius. If you don't want to mine that far away, adjust the range with a screwdriver. Each tier of the controller also gives 1 bonus fortune for small ores starting at 4. At tier 3 you'll want to spread the wealth to multiple compressed chests!%n%nThe multiblock miners have been upgraded so that they will chunkload the area they dig in. They will NOT chunkload themselves however. They will dig §odown§r in the chunk they're in like normal, and then dig §oup§r one chunk at a time in other chunks within its range.%n%nYou need mining pipes in the controller and drilling fluid in the fluid hatch. You can also feed mining pipes into an input bus.%n%nYou'll need to make lots of Drilling Fluid. 64 is a tiny amount to get started with! Plan to make thousands of buckets - perhaps onsite, or pumped in via Long Distance Fluid Pipes.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain (and meteors!) on any side.

Put anything you like in the interior - a bed, stairs, torches, etc.%n%nNormal multiblock rules apply - do not cross chunk boundaries with this multiblock.%n%nIf this is your first GregTech multiblock, as with all the rest you will need to whack the controller with a soft mallet to activate it.%n%nIf you have troubles forming the multiblock, try breaking and replacing the controller block.%n%nThe controller can be fed items via hoppers etc to allow for larger batches. Just don't allow the dispenser to fill up or it will void outputs.%n%nThe rotor blades will run if the controller is disabled or has no recipe. Remove the blades when not in use or else they'll be used up.%n%nSpeed and output will be affected by wind speed, recipe, and rotor.%n%nMacerates 16 items at a time.%n%nHigh wind speeds will decrease output.%n%nThe durability will decrease according to the wind speed.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a04.desc=Looking at the Vat's recipes you are likely discouraged by the small amount of fluid being produced per recipe. Don't worry! Fluid consumption and production shown in NEI are just the baseline for the lowest efficiency. The efficiency of Vat depends on the amount of fluid in the Output Hatch.%n%nThe efficiency gradually increases as the output hatch fills up and reaches maximum efficiency when it is §cexactly half-filled§r. If the hatch fills even more, the efficiency goes down again, so try to keep it close to half! At maximum efficiency the amount of fluid consumed and produced per recipe is multiplied by 1001. The items and culture are not affected.%n%nThere are different means to keep it at half, including OC (not SFM, it doesn't like BW fluids), fluid detector+machine controller, or a fluid regulator, as well as more off the wall ones such as frames or block-sharing. If you choose the fluid detector route, remember that using a larger output hatch will make it easier to keep it close to half-filled.

With §3UV§r glass you can have an energy tier as high as you want.%nShift click with screwdriver to change crop type (IC2/normal), sadly you can't farm both in one machine.%nThere are 3 modes to manage your crops (change with screwdriver):%n%n§lSetup mode (input):%n§rIn this mode you can plant your crops in the machine.%nJust put them in the input bus and enable the machine with a soft mallet.%nAdditionally, you need to insert block that is required for IC2 crop to grow (if any)%nWhen the bus is empty, just disable it and change the mode.%nKeep in mind that there is limited space of slots for your crops depending on the voltage.%nWith normal crops you start with 1 slot and that multiplies by 2 every tier past §5EV§r, every slot can take 64 crops of the same type.%nWith IC2 crops you start with 4 slots and that multiplies by 4 every tier past §dLuV§r, every slot can take only 1 crop.%n%n§lSetup mode (output):%n§rThis mode allows you to move your Greenhouse or upgrade your crops.%nWhen the machine is running in this mode it will output all planted crops in the output bus.%n%n§lNormal operation:%n§rWith normal crops it is a straightforward process. Base processing time is 5 seconds, at the end of operation all crops are grown and the outputs are added to the output bus. Additionally the time is lower every tier past §5EV§r §o(The time is divided by the number of tiers past §6HV§r§o, minimum 1 second. WOW) §r%n%nIC2 crops on the other hand, are not that easy. They are normally simulated, but accelerated 32 times. Process time is 5 seconds. You can check the progress of the growing process with a tricorder.%n%nIf you want to grow your crops even faster, then you can use a fertilizer (up to §l400%% more drops§r !). Machine will take fertilizer from the input busses on start of the operation and will be applied to that operation only. Each fetilizer gives +200%% per crop in normal mode or +10%% in IC2 mode. The bonus is applied evenly on crops. Examples:%nNormal mode, 3 wheat seeds, 1 tea seeds, you insert 1 fertilizer, you will get +150%% wheat drops and +50%% tea drops.%nIC2 mode, 16 melon seed bags, you insert 64 fetilizer, you will get +40%% drops.%n%nAdditionally, all your crops need water to grow. Every single crop drinks 1000L per operation. So for example if you have planted 576 tea seeds at §3UV§r voltage you will need 576000 L per second.%n%n§lLast notes:%n§rThe animation can’t be disabled.%nThe lamps can be inverted.%nThe dirt must be tilled.%nIf you encounter any issue or have any suggestion please open an issue on github and ping §l@kuba6000§r.%nThis MB was created to farm tea because I wanted to.%n

# Quest: High Temperature Super Breeder

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c6e.desc=Have you heard of pebble reactors? There's a quest for the other one, the Thorium High Temperature Reactor, on the powergen side of this branch, but this is a diferent multiblock. %n%nIt's called the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR), and it uses fuel pebbles and consumes power. However, it doesn't really make a lot of power, and doesn't even match the EU/t of the other version, despite being much more expensive. The multiblock structure is basically the same, a huge reactor around 12x12x12 blocks in size, with 500+ casings made with Europium. What it doesn't make in power, it compensates in breeding, however.%n%nFor the unaware, this is expensive. Pebble reactors work by stuffing the reactor absolutely full of pebbles, and then the reaction will keep going for, essentially, forever. In this case, you will have a fully automated source of almost endless Lutetium, Plutonium and other things that will be explained in the following quests, alongside the production of fuel and the processing of outputs. What this means is that this is an expensive multiblock, but it's placed a tier in which this expense is actually reasonable, if there is a need for immense, endless breeding of many outputs.%n%nIf you're on the fence about building this, check the next quests to learn more about the fuel and outputs.%n%nNotes:%n%nHTGR has an internal buffer for fuel and only one input bus is required (any will do), as well as only one output bus (reactor automatically compresses every 64 burned pellets into one ball, so you need 6 slots or more to avoid problems with voiding at full capacity).%n%nReactor requires only 72k out of 720k pebbles to operate, but running at minimum capacity means that you will not get any bonuses, such as lower recipe time and higher amount of pebbles processed per cycle.%n%nThis multi consumes 1A LuV when operating, no matter how many pebbles are inside, but it also generates Hot Coolant as it runs. If you use it to generate power, you will gain more EU than is consumed by the reactor. %n%nIn this reactor, the throughput increases with the amount of pebbles put into it.%n%nBy typing HTGR in NEI, you can see all the items that are related to this multiblock.

After a couple days of research I have found one, a factory designed to print out circuit boards.%n%n§4§5§a§d§r§a§rThe PCB Factory is able to use a wide range of plastics to create circuit boards ready to be used. The printing mechanism overheats when it tries to overclock currently, so I will have to find a way to make that work later. Boards with neurons on them will also take a bit before they can be made, but it won't be hard to achieve.%n%n§T§2Trace size: the trace size represents the lines between components, which are needed to transmit the electrical signals on the circuit. One can make it smaller to slow down the machine, but use less resources, or make it bigger to make it faster, but use more resources.%n%n§1Formulas:%n- 10000/(TraceSize/100) Production%n- RecipeDuration/TraceSize^2 Time%n%n§2Using the GUI, the player can go to the configuration menu. There they can change the trace size or add new parts to the multiblock.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ccd.desc=With the control of spacetime you have achieved and its 0K temperature it would be possible to make an even better cooling unit. A casing able to keep its room temperature very low and nanites which can transfer heat effectively because of their small bodies. This doesn't quite work and some coolant is still needed, but water freezes at those temperatures so super coolant will be our choice.%n%n§3The Thermosink Radiator allows for 4/4 OC making it possible to speed through recipes. It requires 10/s of super coolant in its hatch, its in the same place as the Liquid Cooling Tower.%n%n§4This upgrade is incompatible with its lower tier predecessor.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ccc.desc=With the Nano Forge built, we can upgrade our production of circuit boards for free, but the nanites need a container to hold them. The current casings aren't enough, we need to find an alternative casing.%n%nAfter some research, infinity as a frame and enriched holmium as the protection layer seems to work well. It can be allowed to let through nanites to go into the printer base so that extra material can be directly removed instead of trying to go slower.%n%n§3Allows the player to use the tier 2 recipes with the use of a silver nanite in the input bus.%nThis also unlocks parallels of the PCB Factory with said formula: Log2(x) parallels, where x is the amount of nanites in the input bus.

Well the silver nanite isn't rigid enough for that so a new nanite will be needed... and so will new casings. Heard that celestial tungsten is a good candidate for a frame. Quantum can be used for the protection as these nanites will be forever flying around inside.%n%nThe structure will need to change as it needs to be a bit bigger and taller.%n%n§3Works the same as the Tier 2 in most cases, but allows the player to use even less resources by using a gold nanite.

Carbon ones can be made in an assembly line, but very inefficiently. There must be a better way.%n%nWhat about a Nano Forge, able to cut up blocks into nano-thin sheets and then creating the first nanite, which helps create thousands of them in mere seconds.%n%n§3The Nano Forge is a big multiblock requiring lots of power over the course of a couple minutes. It is able to use TT energy hatches (including lasers). The controller must have a carbon nanite to use tier 1 recipes.%n%nDespite what NEI might claim there are no minimum voltages for the Nano Forge recipes. If you want to do a recipe you just have to achieve the raw EU/t required, no matter the voltage.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd0.desc=Carbon Nanites are good first worker, but they don't have much in the way of working with more complex systems as they have a very basic nanite network. So a new more advanced nanite will be needed to produce complex nanites.%n%nThe neutronium nanite is an in-between of the two tiers able to produce tier 2 nanites, which have other uses.%n%n§3When putting the neutronium nanite in the controller, you will need to wait for the structure check to happen again or break and replace the controller with a neutronium nanite inside. Allows the Nano Forge to make tier 2 nanites.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000007f8.desc=Swimming in logs? Turn those logs into clean burning charcoal! The Industrial Coke Oven is a 3x3x3 multiblock that runs much faster than those gigangic Pyrolyse Ovens. With one of these, you can replace several of those, since it does up to 24x parallels.%n%nYou'll be able to effectively retire the Pyros from now on, unless there's some very fast recipe that they can keep up with. To turn Wood into Charcoal, for example, this ICO can keep up with an entire farm as long as you provide it enough Nitrogen for the job!%n%n§3This multi is EV and doesn't actually need the ABS.

# Quest: Energy Buffers

These are specifically GT++ Rocket Fuels, and automating them for powergen in this multi will also provide you with endless fuel for your space travels.%n%nThe math regarding the Rocketdyne is complicated. Looking at the controller's tooltip helps, but the main gist of it is like this: provide Carbon Dioxide and make sure it doesn't run out, choose the EU/t you want to get, calculate the amount of fuel you need for the fuel you will use, and then provide enough Liquid Hydrogen to boost the multi, according to the EU/t value.%n%nYou will always want to have the Rocketdyne boosted, for several reasons. Assuming you have at least a buffered IV Dynamo Hatch, outputting close to the maximum on that hatch will lower the fuel efficiency, but not if it's boosted. Additionally, this multi doesn't consume fuel continuously, but with intervals of 1 second between consuming and not consuming, while generating power all the same. Boosting this consumption results in huge fuel efficiency, combined with the high fuel values of the Rocket Fuels.%n%n§3This multi is IV.

# Quest: Chemical Pseudo-Altercations
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd7.name=Chemical Pseudo-Altercations
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd7.desc=Learning more about the world and its ways is a sign of wisdom. However, the truly wise are the ones who know what is unimportant and can be skipped. For a true breacher of technology, the constraints of physics and chemistry are not essential. To skip past their technicalities, the Quantum Force Transformer comes into play.%n%nThis multi is meant to replicate the most popular and important processing lines in the pack’s progression, mostly those related to chemistry. Because of recursion in recipes, where earlier tier materials are required to craft higher tier equivalents, there are a lot of early processing lines that stay up through progression. Even worse, they often need more and more machines to keep up with increasing speed demands. To save on lag, this multi will do those processing lines in one step and without most of the extra chemicals that are added to purify the inputs into the outputs.%n%nThe Quantum Force Transformer (QFT) is unlocked in UEV, after Bio Mainframes have been crafted, and with the addition of a single Eternal Singularity and other materials. It’s a tall, 15x15 multiblock with many different casings, including two that are upgradable and decide the two tiers of the multi. Although it’s available in UEV, the upgraded casings require more and more expensive materials, while also unlocking skips for more advanced processing lines. For example, a platline skip can be done in the earlier QFT tier, whereas a Kevlar skip can only be done in the last tier.%n%nEach recipe that the QFT has represents a single processing line or a big part of a line. The inputs for the early plastic skip, for example, are the basic components of the plastics on a molecular level (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc.), and not the multi-step chemicals that were used half a dozen tiers earlier. All recipes have 3 or more outputs, and every output has a chance to appear: the chance for each is 100%% divided by the number of outputs. To increase it, there are additional mechanics that can be used.%n%nSimply put, the QFT uses huge amounts of energy and quantum field stabilization to disassemble simple molecules and assemble them into more complex ones, without needing additives or constrained processes. The only addition to the base inputs that the multi requires is a specific catalyst, which the smart circuits use to guide the materials into what they ultimately transform into, but they are never consumed or lost in any way. %n%nThis direct process simplifies long processing chains to one step, but it has two consequences: it makes the process expensive, given the extreme conditions needed to undergo the transformation (in a similar way to fusion), but it also generates many different outputs at once, none of which are guaranteed, and it’s impossible to choose between them without adding something else into the setup to alter the conditions inside the QFT in some way. Throwing more energy into the multi won’t do anything, and better materials don’t seem to work, so what is the next step? That is what the next two quests will answer.%n

# Quest: Focusing Science and Mystery
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd8.name=Focusing Science and Mystery
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd8.desc=This mechanic is completely optional, and never required for crafting. However, it’s greatly incentivized when the number of parallels is high and when crafting the new items to unlock the new tiers. “Focusing”, in general, means to increase the chances of the outputs in a QFT recipe, and it can be done in two ways, possibly both at the same time. Each method uses a new plasma, both of which are crafted in a T4 Fusion Reactor by using other plasmas as the inputs, including one T3 plasma for each. These plasmas are Neptunium and Fermium and they can be used together, or individually.%n%nWhen Neptunium Plasma is present, the current recipe can have one of its inputs focused. The specific output is chosen with a circuit in the input bus (this is the only thing circuits do for this multi), where circuit 1 is for the 1st output visible in NEI, circuit 2 is for the 2nd output, and so on. It is up to the player to choose which output they want the most out of all the existing ones, and the fact that every recipe has multiple outputs is because of this mechanic.%n%nWhen an output is successfully focused with Neptunium, its chance increases by reducing the chance of all the other outputs. The logic for this change is as follows:%n%n-> Without focusing, the chance of each output is 100 / number of outputs;%n-> If the casing tier matches the recipe tier, the chance of all other outputs is halved and the sum of those halves is added to the focused output (for example, 20/20/20/20/20 becomes 60/10/10/10/10);%n-> If the casing tier is +1 over the recipe tier, halve the other outputs' chance again (for example, 60/10/10/10/10 becomes 80/5/5/5/5);%n-> If the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe tier, set the focused output to 100%% and the rest to 0%%.%n%nIn general, this type of focusing doesn’t increase the total amount of outputs, save for the new items added with this multi that will come out in smaller quantities. Instead, it allows the player to replace less useful outputs with the more useful ones, and this choice is completely up to them, as is the choice of focusing at all.%n%nWhen Fermium Plasma is present, the current recipe will have all of its output chances boosted, unless the chance for one of them is 100%%, in which case that chance is unchanged. This happens because the boost increases if the output chance before ferm focusing is smaller, and the maximum boost is achieved when the chance is 0%%, which happens with high-tier nep focusing.%n%nWhen an output is successfully focused with Fermium, its chance increases based on how far it is from 100%% chance. This applies to all the outputs at once, and the logic for this change is as follows:%n%n-> If the casing tier matches the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/4 of the "failure" chance (for example, a 50%% chance output has a 50%% chance of failure, so it gets boosted by 12.5%%, becoming 62.5%%)%n-> If the casing tier is +1 over the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/3 of the "failure" chance%n-> If the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/2 of the "failure" chance%n%nWith the two plasmas combined and a +2 or +3 over recipe tier, a 5-output recipe would normally have 20/20/20/20/20 chances, but it becomes 100/50/50/50/50.%n%nMany lategame multis have parallels, which means they complete the recipe several times at once every time the recipe time is completed, instead of only one, but they require extra EU to achieve this. This makes power the biggest constraint for those multiblocks, and the same happens with the QFT, given that recipe inputs are generally very cheap and simple. Throwing more power at the machine means more outputs, in general.%n%nGiven that, a player that wants a faster QFT will make more catalysts to unlock more parallels, but each added parallels adds to the other ones, to a cap of 64. Focusing, instead, changes output odds, which effectively multiplies the number of outputs per cycle. In terms of speed, a recipe with 4 outputs and 64 parallels runs at the speed of 256 parallels for the focused output if it’s nep focused to the maximum of 100%%, since it was 25%% originally. %n%nThis is a lot of saved EU for high-tier, high-parallel QFTs, so it is the main reason for focusing, and both plasmas are useful here. However, plasma consumption is not the same regardless of parallels, it instead scales with the square root of the number of correct catalysts for the recipe, which is to say, the number of parallels.%n%nThis further applies to the 3 new items that are needed to upgrade the casing tiers. Since their output amount is much smaller than usual, they could get a further boost if focusing is being used, to incentivize the plasma mechanic when upgrading the multi.

# Quest: Catalyzing Miracles
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd9.name=Catalyzing Miracles
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd9.desc=The QFT uses the kind of catalyst that the Chemical Plant also does. However, like the plants that have Awakened Draconium coils or higher, it does not consume the catalyst’s durability on recipe finish, behaving more like a real-life catalyst that is regenerated after being used. This makes the catalysts used here more expensive to craft, as was the case with the Infinite Mutation Catalyst for Mutated Living Solder, which is meant to be used only with those coils that make it last forever.%n%nGiven that there is no durability loss, it would seem only one catalyst needs to be crafted. However, there are two reasons for this to not be true: firstly, each QFT recipe uses a different catalyst; secondly, the QFT checks for parallels by counting the amount of catalysts it has in its input buses for the recipe in question (the current max is 64 parallels, for a stack of the correct catalyst, this can be changed if the number is not right). This system makes it so that crafting 1 of the correct type of catalyst is required to unlock a recipe, but making more is completely optional and only changes the speed at which the multi crafts, provided it gets enough EU input.%n%nThe recipes for the catalysts will be a sort of middle-ground between the cheap cost of the early variations, which are consumed, and the Infinite Mutation Catalyst, which lasts forever and doesn’t give any bonuses when there are multiple of it. On top of that, every catalyst will need some of the materials that it unlocks in the QFT, which is to say, the original processing line will have to be built to craft the catalyst that allows the player to skip it in the QFT. This applies to every recipe, and in turn every line that can be skipped.%n%nTo improve the general speed of processing, it is possible to add parallel crafting to the multi, and this is done by adding more catalysts. Each new correct catalyst adds a new “stream” of processing, which allows inputs to be transformed in multiple batches at a time, one new batch per catalyst, up to a maximum of 64. The other, more complicated way is to boost the chances of a successful output by adding more energy to the system, but in a special way: instead of using direct EU, using it to create a powerful plasma works to improve the QFT processing.%n%nIf the correct plasmas are added, the boosting will work, but it is also possible to upgrade the structure itself to perform chemistry skips that are not possible with the base QFT. These upgrades rely on more advanced and powerful materials, mainly in the material progression of DTPF recipes. However, those existing materials are not enough, because the quantum stabilization can’t be maintained with those “foreign” substances. Luckily, the QFT itself can produce the items needed to build the upgraded casings, and these items are outputs of some of the skips performed in the multi. It begins by allowing the much simpler production of already-owned materials but, in this process, it unlocks entirely new materials that are useful to improve the structure itself.%n%nThere are three new items and four tiers in the structure. The first tier can be built without them, but every new tier needs a new item crafted in the tier before. These outputs are related to the recipe where they can be obtained, and they possess unique characteristics that, in real life, are only theoretical.%n%nThe first item you will need to craft is the Hyper-Stable Self-Healing Adhesive. To craft this material, proceed with the Glue/Solder recipe by using the Adhesion Promoter Catalyst. Additionally, make these other catalysts to prove you're well set in your QFT journey.%n

# Quest: Tier 2 Transforming

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cda.desc=After a significant amount of progression, you will be able to build the tier 2 QFT by replacing 2 of its casings, the ones on the exterior shell, by the ones listed in this quest. When finished, the multi will be able to perform the monaline skip and a two out of three naqline skips. Amidst all the expensive materials, there is one that can only be crafted in a t1 QFT, so I hope you've got it going.%n%nThe first item - Hyper-Stable Self-Healing Adhesive. This adhesive is very effective at sticking things together, but it is also quantum-stable, which means that it cannot be altered or damaged by simple quantum fields. On top of that, it also has self-healing properties, which means that it can tolerate the increased energy flow of a tier 2, 3 or 4 QFT by repairing itself even when damaged, regardless of how that damage is applied.

# Quest: Tier 3 Focusing

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cdb.desc=With access to even better materials, you can upgrade to a t3 QFT. In this tier, two new skips are available: the final naqline skip and the stem cell skip.%n%nThe second item - Superconductor Rare-Earth Composite. This contributes to promoting the flow of energy, instead of stabilizing the structure like the previous item. Given that damage can be automatically repaired, the focus now is to make it easier for the energy to flow from one component to the next and allow for more energy input into the multi. The existing superconductors can’t handle quantum flow well, so this composite can be used instead to remove all resistance to flow across the outer shell of the structure, thanks to the unique composition of the transitions between the rare-earth elements present in the composite. The transition from one to the next is so gradual that the quantum flow has no obstacles or loose ends to escape from.

# Quest: Tier 4 Transforming
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cdc.name=Tier 4 Transforming
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cdc.desc=The final tier of the QFT, built on many stacks of Spacetime. When it's complete, you will have access to all the skips currently in the game, the new ones being the bio cell skip, the Kevlar skip and the Radox + Xenoxene skip.%n%nThe third item - Black Body Naquadria Supersolid. Even through all the upgrades made beforehand, it’s still not possible to reach the stage of chemical skips for the items that are used to build the first QFT, such as the bioware circuits. This is the theoretical limit of the multi, and reaching this limit needs a material obtained from the second half of the Naquadah line. This new Naquadria-related substance has the characteristics of a black body, a material that absorbs all radiation it receives and reflects none, and is a supersolid, which is to say, a solid that flows like a fluid that has zero viscosity. By applying these qualities together, through a single material, it’s possible to guarantee easy and steady flow of quantum energy at any EU level, even in the MAX tier. With all these advances put together, the QFT is fully unlocked and can create components up to those made in the UHV tier.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000046.desc=You've almost made it. One last crafting step is required in order to advance to Tier 1. Keep going!%n%nThis Steam Turbine generates electricity from Steam. The power source you've been using is the same, but from this point on you will generate EU, and bring it to your machines via cables, instead of bringing the Steam directly to them. Luckily, electric machines don't need an exhaust port, and they are considerably more efficient than Bronze machines.%n%nAt a later point, you will most likely switch from Steam to another fuel, though.

# Quest: §6§lMV Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000059.name=§6§lMV Steam Turbine
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000059.desc=Having moved up to MV, you can continue using Steam. However, it's not a great idea to stay here, and other fuel types will be more useful to you instead. This is because Steam Turbine efficiency drops quickly with every tier (this one is only 75%%), and the Steam itself needs big pipes to carry it around, compared to Benzene or Diesel.%n%nThat said, if you want to keep using this, then it's a good idea to build a Large Bronze Boiler or, later on, a Large Steel Boiler. You will need lots of solid fuel, probably Charcoal, so make sure you automate it! Definitely do not forget the water.

# Quest: §a§lAppropriate Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000be.name=§a§lAppropriate Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000be.desc=Whether you used magic, steam, oil or biogas for power until now, you will run into problems as you advance to higher tiers. So you'll need to upgrade your power grid, at least for your EBF(s). So let's start with something more powerful: A nuclear reactor!%n%nIf you want to know how they work, refer to The Internet or the Reactor Planner at https://github.com/MauveCloud/Ic2ExpReactorPlanner/releases%n%nNote: The EU multiplier is set to 10x in this pack. That means your nuclear reactor is 10 times more efficient. Make sure to set the planner to GTNH mode under advanced. Also, the base numbers (before 10xing) can be seen on the hover text for all the components.%n%nIf you just want to use them, go to https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Nuclear_Reactors for reactor designs. The Thorium 1920 EU one is probably best for now.

# Quest: Standard Nuclear Fuel: Uranium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000bf.name=Standard Nuclear Fuel: Uranium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000bf.desc=Just "regular" uranium fuel, nothing special about it. It produces 5x the power, and 4x the heat of thorium, while lasting 2/5 the time.%n%nMost fuel rods are basically this, but slightly modified. You generally get this from Mars and it's moons, but you can get a little from centrifuging thorium if you want.%n%nBTW, one of the reactor types 'pulses' the reactor to turn it off once it gets too hot. You can pack in the rods and then cool it off for a while to get higher efficiency out of each rod. Try it if you like explosions.

# Quest: Standard Nuclear Fuel II: Naquadah
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000768.name=Standard Nuclear Fuel II: Naquadah
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000768.desc=These are...not worth it. Go do something else with your enriched naquadah, like putting it in a naq gen if you want power. They work §oexactly§r the same as uranium other than materials cost/output.%n%n§3PS: You can get Nq+ from both centrifuging Nq dust or processing the ore.%n%n§3And why are they Naquadah rods when they're made of Enriched Naquadah?

# Quest: Alternate Nuclear Fuel: Tiberium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c6.name=Alternate Nuclear Fuel: Tiberium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c6.desc=They're the same as uranium but produce half as much heat. Given that there's no reactor designs floating around, and the fact that you need to go to Ross128ba, a T5 rocket (LuV) planet to get the tiberium, I'm gonna say they're probably not worth it. If you disagree, make a design and show it to people, 'kay?

# Quest: Obscenely Dangerous Nuclear Fuel: The Core
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001ea.name=Obscenely Dangerous Nuclear Fuel: The Core
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001ea.desc=For the truly insane mad scientists out there. Or people who can read a website (not guaranteed, trust me!). You HAVE to use coolant cells with it if you want power or to have it not explode after 1s.

# Quest: Tricky Nuclear Fuel: MOX
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c0.name=Tricky Nuclear Fuel: MOX
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c0.desc=Under normal conditions, produces the same amount of power as uranium, but MOX produces more power the more you let the reactor heat up. Try to come up with a heat-neutral design as close to the limit as possible to take advantage of this. It lasts 1/2 the time, and produces more heat once the reactor is over 50%%. A fuel for all the engineers out there.%n%n§3You'll need to run a uranium reactor for a while to get some plutonium if you don't have another way to get it. Remember that there's more than 1 type!%n%n§4Make sure to test in creative and/or use protection against explosions!

# Quest: Tricky Nuclear Fuel II: Naquadria
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000769.name=Tricky Nuclear Fuel II: Naquadria
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000769.desc=They're so not worth it I'm just going to give you back the materials. Like naquadah, they're the same as MOX other than materials.%n%n§3PS: You can get Nq* from both centrifuging Nq or Nq+ dust, processing the ores, or thermal centrifuging the depleted Nq+ rods.

# Quest: §a§lBasic Nuclear Fuel: Thorium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c1.name=§a§lBasic Nuclear Fuel: Thorium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c1.desc=The weakest of all fuel rods, but very easy to produce, very easy to keep cool and runs twice as long as uranium. It even returns 1/3 of the thorium back later. A perfect "fission and forget" power source.%n%n§4Note: After they're used up you can recycle them to get Lutetium which is used for making americium in the fusion reactor. Americium is §lneeded§r§4 for top tier materials later, so start stockpiling now. Plus, you get power!

# Quest: §a§lDouble the Fun
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000076b.name=§a§lDouble the Fun
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000076b.desc=Need even more power? Why not combine rods? Produces more power (NOT double, it varies per rod type) and more heat (again NOT double) but only uses up one slot. You need more complex designs to handle them, but you were ready for that, right?%n%nSo how about doubling your doubling to double your double (4x)? Quad rods put out even more power and heat, expect all the other rods to work similarly (for the most part).%n%n§3BTW it's more efficient to go 1->4 rather than 1->2->4 materials-wise.

# Quest: §a§lUnfortunately, There's No Depleted Uranium Bullets
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000076c.name=§a§lUnfortunately, There's No Depleted Uranium Bullets
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000076c.desc=After your rods have finished their cycle they turn into depleted rods. You can then thermal centrifuge them for some materials back. Depending on the rod, you can get different stuff, see NEI or the wiki for details.

# Quest: §a§lIncreasing the Capacity
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c3.name=§a§lIncreasing the Capacity
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c3.desc=To unleash the full potential of your reactor, you have to attach six reactor chambers to it.

# Quest: §a§lMonitoring Your Reactor
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c2.name=§a§lMonitoring Your Reactor
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c2.desc=It's important to monitor your reactor (Or just fancy to have a big screen somewhere...). So now that you've gained knowledge about the available fuel rods, you can start to build yourself a power plant. Here is something to help you out.%n%nUse the sensor kit on the block you want to monitor, then put the sensor card in the display panel. Next select which lines of information you want to display.

# Quest: §a§lMove the Heat
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c4.name=§a§lMove the Heat
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c4.desc=Reactors heat up, so you need to "move the heat away" to somewhere else. Either read a wiki and try to comprehend how these work, or give up and just use the versions on the wiki.

# Quest: §a§lVenting Heat
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c5.name=§a§lVenting Heat
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c5.desc=You can't just move the heat around, eventually you need to get rid of it. Just like the exchangers, there are different types of vents, each of them has a certain usage. Same as the other quest, either read a wiki and try to comprehend how these work, or give up and just use the versions on the wiki.

# Quest: §a§lNo Boom Tomorrow
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000076e.name=§a§lNo Boom Tomorrow
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000076e.desc=With a nuke, you can cause some real catastrophic damage to your base. You can either place it 20 chunks away, or surround it with blast proof materials.%n%nFused Quartz is no good now, forget about it ok? Instead, use the GTNH approved Plated Reinforced Stone series! Or one of the other options I guess, like Warded Glass. You may need multiple layers depending on your reactor, try it out in creative. Remember you must close in the corners - blasts can slip through the cracks. To get power out, do right angle turns on the wires as blasts go in a straight line.%n%n§3There are 6 of them, use NEI.%n%nOkay, okay, you don't have to forget Fused Quartz, I'll give you some. Maybe you can stop rain with it.

# Quest: Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000af1.name=Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000af1.desc=Runs forever on the fuel you give it. Puts out 1 EU/t, but doubles for each one added, up to 32 EU/t. Might be useful for a farm?

# Quest: Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator

# Quest: §6§lLarge Heat Exchanger - Fermat's Last
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000771.name=§6§lLarge Heat Exchanger - Fermat's Last
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000771.desc=The Large Heat Exchanger is a powergen multi that accepts a non-direct fuel, and doesn't output EU. What is it for, then? §7§7§7To heat up water with hot liquids, that's what!§r§r§r%n%nEffectively, it's a Steam Boiler that uses fluids instead of solids, but it's more complicated. The two main sources of energy here are Lava and Hot Coolant, and the second is more powerful, but harder to get. Lava can be automated from Everburn Urns or a myriad of other option, while Hot Coolant usually requires a proper powergen setup.%n%nFor Lava, the LHE will output §d§d§d160 L of Steam for every 1 L of Lava, up to 1000 L/s of Lava input§r§r§r (§a§a§a4000 EU/t§r§r§r at 100%% turbine efficiency). For Hot Coolant, the LHE will output §d§d§d400 L of Steam for every 1 L of Hot Coolant, up to 800 L/s of input§r§r§r (§a§a§a8000 EU/t§r§r§r at 100%% turbine efficiency).%n%n§c§c§cIf you go above these input rates, the output becomes Superheated Steam, which needs to pass through a Large HP Steam Turbine before the regular Large Steam Turbine.§r§r§r The maximum input rate here is twice of what was before, the conversion is §d§d§d1:80 for Lava§r§r§r and §d§d§d1:200 for Hot Coolant§r§r§r, and the energy output at 100%% turbine efficiency is §a§a§a12000 EU/t§r§r§r for Lava and §a§a§a24000 EU/t§r§r§r for Hot Coolant.%n%n§6§lVery powerful, but complicated, and needs turbines!§r§r§r%n%n§3For more information, go to §nhttps://tinyurl.com/GTNH-LHE§r§3 and read about it there, or to §nhttps://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Fluid_Reactor§r §3for how to use it in a Fluid Reactor setup.

# Quest: Deep Earth Heating Pump

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ace.desc=This allows you to skip the Fluid Reactor part of a FR setup, by heating the coolant with geothermal energy.%n%nIt's basically free power, but so is using an everburn urn with the LHE, so whatever. This is insanely expensive, so keep that in mind!

# Quest: More Advanced Reactors
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b0d.name=More Advanced Reactors
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b0d.desc=Fluid Nukes, Vac Nukes and Wrench Reactors (lol), are more advanced versions of the normal one.%n%nFluid means you build it differently (with the parts on the right, it's a 5x5 cube surrounding the normal one), with the goal of producing as much hot coolant (cycle in non-hot) as possible, to use that to produce power. It doesn't produce power on it's own, but more overall. Send it to the LHE to get SH steam out of it, then go through a HP steam turbine, then a normal steam turbine.%n%nVac nukes remove heat by sending it to coolant cells instead of coolant. Any cell in a cardinal direction will receive the heat instead of the reactor. Use a vacuum freezer to restore the Helium/NaK cells' durability.%n%nWrench reactors are when you fill the reacor with fuel rods, turn it on, and wrench it to reset it's heat state before it explodes. If you can automate it, you deserve a medal!%n%nIf you still don't know what a MOX one is, it produces more power the higher the temperature, so you try to keep it heat neutral, and as hot as possible. Of course, this can cause things nearby to, well, §omelt.§r You use MOX or Naquadria fuel cells work for this. You can also get more Plutonium out of MOX than Uranium.%n%nA breeder reactor is when you setup a reactor to get an item out of it rather than power, like Lutetium from Thorium, Plutonium from MOX, etc. Look at the depleted x fuel rod list in NEI or on the wiki to see more.%n%n§3Since Fluid Nukes are liable to explode if you run out of coolant, make sure you setup a cutoff tied to the temperature or amount of coolant with redstone.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000214.desc=The Combustion Generator produces EU from several fluids. Some are more popular than others, but the Oil processing line has a different combustion fluid in every tier from LV to EV, and all of them are burned in these generators.%n%nTo start, LV is the tier of Light Fuel. It is worth much more than the Oil itself for generating power, so you should distill and dessulfurize the Oil to get clean Light Fuel and use it for power. It's a great way to run your base, and can be upgraded further in the next tiers. Check the "Working with Oil" tab for more information, once you've made a Pump and found some Oil.%n%n§3If you're dealing with Oil processing, this is the type of generator you'll use the most.§r

Centrifuge some Brown and Yellow Limonite to get Hydrogen or dump your unused food in a Centrifuge to get Methane gas. Wood will even give 60 mb per log, and many other crops will also generate Methane this way.%n%nThe main powergen line that uses this generator is Benzene, but that needs MV tier.%n%n§3If you're dealing with fully renewable powergen, this is the type of generator you'll use the most.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000030f.desc=All your little turbines take up too much space? Are you running out of water? It's time to solve these problems. This Large Steam Turbine can help you produce a tremendous amount of energy. It will also distill water for you, so you can use the same water again inside your Large Boiler. Don't forget to make a rotor for the turbine and put inside the controller, otherwise this multiblock won't do anything.%n%nEach turbine has a specific optimal flow, the Steam flow that gives the highest fuel efficiency, the value shown on the turbine's tooltip. This is the flow you want to match, and you can use a Fluid Regulator as a cover to make it exactly what you want, but you can go beyond this flow to get an even higher EU/t value, at a loss of fuel efficiency. You can make turbines in 4 different sizes, with larger turbines producing more EU/t, but with variying amounts of fuel efficiency. Generally, Large is the best due to having the highest fuel efficiency and a good optimal flow rate%n%nWhen using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Steam Turbines being the worst at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 150%% of optimal flow to produce 112%% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 200%% of optimal flow to produce 133%% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 250%% of optimal flow to produce 156%% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away. Don't exceed your dynamo hatch's maximum EU/t output, though, or you will have problems!%n%nTurbines with a small turbine durability below 75k have their recipes removed. Use NEI with the appropriate long rod to find assembler recipes that will work for you. Or the spreadsheet. Long magnalium for small turbines, long titanium for normal turbines, etc.%n%nPre-moon, the best rotors are Shadow Metal or Vibrant Alloy.%n%nPost-moon, the best HV rotors are Shadow Metal or Oriharukon (this is IV-tier). Luckily, turbines are now fully functional with multi-amp dynamos, so give those a try if you need extra amps!%n%nFor additional choices, see the spreadsheet and Large Turbine Calculator.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000766.desc=A Large Gas Turbine is more fuel-efficient than singleblock turbines, and can have lower pollution output with upgraded mufflers.%n%nYou will also need a Muffler and Dynamo Hatch to complete the multiblock. Don't forget to use a Fluid Regulator, to control the flow rate into the multi! It can usually be an LV Fluid Regulator, since the optimal flow is much lower here than in Steam Turbines.%n%nEach turbine material has a specific fuel efficiency (the higher, the more EU you get from the same amount of fuel), and the multi only reaches this efficiency if the fuel flow into it matches the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 150%% of optimal flow to produce 112%% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 300%% of optimal flow to produce 180%% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 450%% of optimal flow to produce 252%% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.%n%nFor the best turbine materials, see the spreadsheet and Large Turbine Calculator.%n%n§4Going forward, the LGT will be capped at 8192 EU/t. You will need to use the advanced large gas turbine beyond that which can only take high value fuels.%n%n%n%n

The higher up in the world you are, the higher the wind level. Below y64, there is never enough wind to be used, and KWG's will not function at all. Weather will also give boosts; Rainy weather will give a 20%% boost to normal wind levels, and stormy weather will give a 50%% boost. The final factor of chance makes the wind strength vary randomly, however there is a limited range of variation.%n%nThe easiest way to check the current wind level in an area is by using a Windmeter. Wind is strongest at around Y160, towards the build limit of Y255 there is very little wind, hence no point attempting to run Windmills that high. While inconvenient, the Wind Generator can run anywhere.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000057b.desc=Using Steam as your single power source in HV is pretty difficult. Your fuel automation will have to be very fast, your pipes will have to be very big and the final efficiency of HV Steam Turbines is 66%%, much lower than the other generators' 85%%. %n%nThis is best used with an efficient furnace, like the GT++ Advanced Furnaces, to power something specific like a farm. Powering your entire automation in your path to an EV, using only these, is a nightmare. If you want more efficiency out of your Steam, consider building a Large Steam Turbine.

# Quest: What Was That? I Can't Hear You Over the Engine!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005c9.name=What Was That? I Can't Hear You Over the Engine!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005c9.desc=The Extreme Combustion Engine is an upgrade to the Large Combustion Engine, the IV version that needs Tungstensteel instead of Titanium. The structure is essentially the same, and it's almost a 1:1 ratio between the two materials, so this is a good generator when you've accumulated several stacks of Tungsteensteel.%n%nThe caveat is that it only accepts High Octane Gasoline. This is the last and most powerful type of combustion fluid made from Oil, and it has the longest processing line of them all. As a reward, it has an excellent §e§b§a2.5M EU per bucket§a§r, and you can burn it here alongside some Liquid Oxygen for almost §a4 IV amps per tick.%n%n§cThe Liquid Oxygen is very important, because it greatly boosts the speed of the multi and the fuel efficiency as well. §f§rIt needs 40 L/s, so you will need more than one Vacuum Freezer to supply it continuously: for an ECE that is always running, you will need a double Vacuum Freezer, 1 EV and 1 HV. You can run less freezers if you overclock them, if the ECE isn't working all the time or if you upgrade to a Cryogenic Freezer,

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000006cc.desc=Your old and trusty combustion engines don't quite cut it anymore, not to mention they're polluting the place. If you want to keep burning liquids, you need to build a better engine. This multiblock can produce 1A of EV voltage by default and 3A if you supply it with oxygen. However, this power doesn't come for free - you need to supply the machine with small amounts of lubricant constantly (and oxygen if you want to boost both its efficiency and output).%n%nYou will also require 3 Input Hatches, a Muffler, and a Dynamo Hatch. Their tiers are up to you.%n%nCetane Boosted Diesel and High Octane Gasoline (HOG) are excellent fuel sources for this engine.%n%nYou will need to keep the area in front of the engine clear so it can pull enough air - not even torches.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000074d.desc=The MV Gas Turbine pairs excellently with Benzene, now that you can actually make it. Look at the "Bio for the Masses" tab for more details on how to go about it, or just check NEI. Benzene is renewable from trees, and it's a powerful source of EU that can keep you going for several tiers as long as you upgrade it with the new multiblocks you unlock over time.%n%nIt's a good idea to switch off Steam, since you need big pipes to carry that around and the fuel efficiency on Steam Turbines is lower. Instead, make a Pyrolyse Oven or an Advanced Coke Oven to make Charcoal faster, extract Benzene from it and run it through a few of these Gas Turbines.

# Quest: §6§lDiesel Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000074e.name=§6§lDiesel Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000074e.desc=The MV Combustion Generator burns Light Fuel faster than the LV version, but you can also automate Diesel and burn that instead, since it's even more powerful. It is arguably the easiest and most efficient way to generate lots of power for automation at this stage, and it'll last you a couple more tiers if you upgrade it as you go.%n%nAdditionally, Diesel can be used as fuel for the Copterpack, a good jetpack that makes it much easier to move around, inside and outside of your base. It's heavily recommended that you make one, if you have Diesel.%n%n§3This will also unlock new quests in the Armors and Jetpacks tab.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000aca.name=This is Not How You Get Into Space
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000aca.desc=This produces power out of Rocket Fuels. To see how to make them, look at the Space Race tab. These are specifically GT++ Rocket Fuels, and automating them for powergen in this multi will also provide you with endless fuel for your space travels.%n%nThe math regarding the Rocketdyne is complicated. Looking at the controller's tooltip helps, but the main gist of it is like this: provide Carbon Dioxide and make sure it doesn't run out, choose the EU/t you want to get, calculate the amount of fuel you need for the fuel you will use, and then provide enough Liquid Hydrogen to boost the multi, according to the EU/t value.%n%nYou will always want to have the Rocketdyne boosted, for several reasons. Assuming you have at least a buffered IV Dynamo Hatch, outputting close to the maximum on that hatch will lower the fuel efficiency, but not if it's boosted. Additionally, this multi doesn't consume fuel continuously, but with intervals of 1 second between consuming and not consuming, while generating power all the same. Boosting this consumption results in huge fuel efficiency, combined with the high fuel values of the Rocket Fuels.%n%n§3This multi is IV.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ae2.desc=This is the HV version, with the lowest efficiency so far of 85%%. You can offset that by just generating more Benzene, alongside Phenol and Toluene in a Distillation Tower, or use Naphtha instead... You have many options at this point, surely enough to fight the increasing power demands of your automation.%n%nBenzene doesn't get upgraded in HV, only in EV.

After a bunch of reactions, you can get a superpowered combustion fuel that is worth §a1M EU per bucket§a§r and run it for quite a while on these improved generators. You will also unlock the Distillation Tower here, so you might get even more fuel that you can burn in these generators.%n%nUnfortunately, the next fuel, unlocked in EV, doesn't come from Diesel.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ae4.desc=You've probably collected a ton of Creosote and have little to use it on. To fix that, build a Semifluid Generator and use it alongside Steam as a secondary power source! Singleblock generators will only use fuel if there is EU demand, so you might end up with a filled Creosote buffer if you aren't consuming enough EU.%n%nTo extract the Creosote from your Coke Ovens, you can use buckets or cells to do it by hand, or the TiCon Faucet into GT fluid pipes, or an Electric Pump cover from You're Going to Hate This #2.%n%nThere are other options to burn Creosote, like the Railcraft Liquid Boilers, but this is much cheaper and easier to set up, while still being efficient with Creosote (6x as efficient as Combustion Generators).

It won't last long, and definitely isn't a good main power source, but it'll give you some EU for your trouble.%n%nAlternatively, Heavy Fuel? It has the same EU per bucket as Benzene, 360k, and is the only semifluid with more than 100k per bucket. If you have it, and are not consuming enough for Diesel, you can use it this way.

# Quest: Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators HV
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ae6.name=Putting the 'Semi' Back Into Generators HV
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ae6.desc=If you've built Distillation Towers to improve your Oil or Benzene processing line, you might have ended up with some extra fuels that are semifluids, such as Heavy Fuel or Creosote. If you've accumulated them so much that they've started voiding, you can instead make an HV Semifluid Generator and get free power out of them!%n%nThe Creosote from one DT that is processing Wood Tar is enough to power the DT itself, depending on the fuel efficiency. One HV generator is just enough to power it.

You can get this steam through the LHE, the SOFC Mk II or the Titanium/Tungstensteel Boilers. It gets converted to normal steam as the output at a 1:1 ratio, so make sure to have a non-HP one to take advantage of that. In total, a HP Steam Turbine and a regular one combined produce 3x the EU with Superheated Steam that normal Steam would produce.

Well, if you are a crazy fan of diesel or benzene, you will love it.%n%nThis engine accepts all diesel, gas and also rocket fuel, although the Rocketdyne burns the latter more efficiently. It also needs Combustion Promoter to keep it running.%n%nThis engine consumes all fuel and combustion promoter in its input hatches per second and outputs power depending on the amount of fuel consumed, and its fuel value.%n%nIts efficiency is determined by the Combustion Promoter/Fuel ratio. If the ratio is larger (there is more promoter), the efficiency will be higher. The max efficiency is 150%%, but you cannot achieve this value without inputting an infinite amount of promoter. Expect efficiencies around 130%% for high fuel value fuels like High-Octane Gasoline, unless you spend a LOT of promoter.%n%ne.g. You input 100mB/s of HOG and 1000mB/s of combustion promoter. The efficiency is 149%% and the sum of the HOG fuel value is 250000 EU. The output power will be 250,000 * 149%% / 20 = 18625 EU/t.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5d.desc=Once you progress enough in ZPM to make ZPM Dynamo Hatches, you can increase each turbine's output to 524,288 EU/t. At this number, you'll be a lot less limited by the turbine material, and it's possible to increase the total power output of one Fusion Reactor considerably. You can cover the total Helium Plasma output from one reactor with 3 Plasma Turbines, if you choose the right materials:%n%nLarge High Durability Compound Steel 230%% 202,860 EU/t%nLarge Atomic Separation Catalyst 200%% 399,672 EU/t%nLarge Adamantium 180%% 170,010 EU/t%nLarge Draconium 170%% 214,200 EU/t (durable)%nLarge Ichorium 170%% 342,720 EU/t (very durable)%nLarge Neutronium 160%% 241,920 EU/t (very durable)%n%nThe power output and final efficiency can vary a lot, based on which turbines you're using. Some of them, like Ichorium and Neutronium, last basically forever, while others will need to be replaced from time to time but offer higher efficiency. If you want to get more power per turbine, to reach closer to the dynamo's limit, you can increase the flow of plasma to the turbine, but be careful! You can't go beyond the dynamo's limit, and you will also lose efficiency as you increase the flow amount. More concrete values for efficiency loss can be found in the Plasma Turbine quest in the LuV page.%n%nMake a normal or buffered ZPM dynamo to complete the quest.

Look at the UV Dynamo Hatch's recipe and you have your new objective. When you arrive there, each turbine that is equipped with that impressive block will be able to output up to 2,097,152 EU/t, which again opens you up to new turbine opportunities. Some good choices at this point are as follows:%n%nLarge Cosmic Neutronium 220%% 1,330,560 EU/t%nLarge Awakened Draconium 190%% 478,800 EU/t%nLarge Trinium 180%% 1,452,520 EU/t%n%nAt this point, you might consider building more t1 Fusion Reactors to process other materials. Even if you stop the reactor you're using to generate this plasma, the EU cost of restarting it is less than 1 bucket of plasma, so it's probably not that big of a deal.%n%nMake a normal or buffered UV dynamo to complete the quest.

It will be a different story in UHV, when you can once again quadruple the max output of each turbine, and also unlock Infinity as an option for turbines.%n%nLarge Infinity 270%% 4,354,560 EU/t%nLarge Infinity Catalyst 200%% 806,400 EU/t%n%nYes, that's basically it. You can use any material from the previous turbine quests, but when you make the t8 rocket and can mine Infinity Catalyst, these are the two options. Obviously, Infinity is much better, but also much more expensive. If you stick with fusion, you will need several of those to push through the endgame. Remember that you can input plasma beyond the optimal flow, and get more out of each turbine at the cost of fuel efficiency.%n%nMake a normal or buffered UHV dynamo to complete the quest.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000866.desc=If you want a stationary battery, you can make an AFSU capable of storing up to 1 billion EU and charging items. You can pick it up with a wrench, but you'll lose a percentage of the stored EU. Make sure you right-click, not left-click. Left-clicking will cause it to lose all stored EU.%n%nAs an alternative, if you can afford them, try the GT++ Energy Buffers. They are more expensive and cannot charge items, but store more, don't lose any EU, and can be configured from 1-16A. See the GT++ tab for details.%n%n§3These can apparently draw infinite amps, so maybe use a diode or something if you like having the power on.

Though at most it's still only 2.2%%%n%nFor the first, smallest one, you'll need the following, plus an Energy Hatch and a Dynamo (or the laser equivalents). Remember that you can get your Lapos back if you run the capacitor through an unpackager. Finally a reason to make one!%n%nYou can use Laser Hatches, that can output very high amperage. You need at least UV Glass to use them. (This is also the case with PSS BTW.)%n%nBTW your LSC can hold between 540M and 8.1B EU using only the EV capacitors.

The wireless network can store a total of 2^(2^31) EU, far exceeding even a max tier LSC.%n%nYou can share a wireless network with others by adding them to your network with /gt global_energy_join user1 user2. This will make user1 use user2's energy when interacting with the global network. You can leave a network at any time by doing /gt global_energy_join your_name your_name. %n%nYou cannot connect wires to these blocks. These are also designed to be highly lag efficient, meaning EU is added at large intervals to prevent needless calculations from occurring.

From a certain point of view.%n%nUse the (potential) force! And store energy that way. Simply construct a dam and floor vast areas with water. You may add energy to your storage by pumping more water into it or just drain it back into energy whenever you need. This works especially well with fluctuating energy sources like wind, water, and solar. Or you dump excess energy into it so you can use it another time. The capacity is huge and the choice is yours.%n%nSounds great! But...? - Indeed. There is a catch: Pumps and Turbines will have efficiency correlated loss. Still interested? Let's get to crafting!%n%nThe multi-block has an unusual shape: the back is open. The lake will spawn inside the multi-block and spread block-by-block as far as it can/is allowed. It will replace plants like water (make sure to secure your IC2 Crops!) but not replace any solid blocks. Additionally, you can specify limits in any direction. The water will NEVER spread past these limits. You can set those limits in a second GUI by right clicking the controller with a screwdriver.%n%nWhen you enter a limit, it will correct itself to the nearest valid setting. Especially if you try to spread past the server limits. You may talk your admin into raising these limits (these limits are designed to limit griefing). Further, water is not able to spread into foreign towns.%nYou will also find 3 magical buttons in the top-right of this GUI. From left to right: The first will slowly despawn the lake blocks. You can use this to shrink the lake if it spread past a barrier for example. The multi-block will also initialize with this configuration so there is no accidental flooding. The second and third buttons will slowly spawn more lake blocks. Additionally, the second button will render those lake blocks pink so you see where they are so you may plug holes and such. In this "debug" mode you can walk/breathe/act in the lake like in air. This should make it easy to create a sunken village for decoration purposes. The third button is for normal operations so you can see the water and enjoy a swim in your energy buffer.%n%nOf course, there is also a normal GUI (simple right-click). It shows you the energy stored in the dam. To reach higher water levels you are required to use stronger pumps. For this purpose, you may configure the voltage tier of the GUI with a circuit in the circuit slot. Don't worry: It is only optical. You cannot void any energy if you set a low voltage tier. It is only for the player information. You may give it a try with the reward you earn...%n%nIf you have any further questions, find missing information, or have suggestions please do not hesitate to post on the official GT New Horizons Discord.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000222.desc=During your travels you may have seen some huge oil spouts. Now's the time to make a pump and go collect this black gold into tanks. Oil can be burned directly in a combustion generator (onsite to power the pump, perhaps?) or be refined for better fuels and crafting materials. %n%nBring a generator or battery buffer (with full batteries obviously) with you to power the pump. Thanks to the advancement of technology the pump can auto output on top. Stacking multiple pumps makes them work faster. In that case, oil has to be removed from the bottom of the stack using a pump cover or other means like a conduit.%n%nTaller spouts have more oil. But for the LV pump, it's better to use the short spouts if possible since it doesn't have enough range to fully collect the larger ones in the horizontal range. Save the taller spouts for MV or HV pumps.%n%nMining pipes are needed for pumping the oil, same as the auto miner. When it hits the bottom (or something in the way), if there's no fluid left to collect, it will start retracting the pipes. Same thing if you disable it with a soft mallet. You can also change the range with a screwdriver if there's a reason to do that, like collecting lava in a limited area faster.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on all sides. And set a waypoint with JourneyMaps so you don't forget where you placed it!%n%n§3Once you run out of surface oil, you'll want to turn to:%n1) Oilsands ore, though this is better suited for making heavy oil%n2) Making oil from logs in a pyro%n4) Ridiculous bio vat nonsense%n5) Crops%n6) Bees%n7) The real answer, which is Underground or UG oil. Dims generally have a couple fluids that can be accessed with a multiblock version of the pump, available in MV+. Go read the quest for it when it's available for details

# Quest: Here's Some Oil
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000baa.name=Here's Some Oil
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000baa.desc=Welcome! This is the questline that shows the path through oil processing towards all the useful items and fluids that can be obtained from it. Working with this black liquid involves a lot of steps that range from LV (Low Voltage), all the way to IV (Insane Voltage), and outputs that are useful at those tiers and beyond. %n%nOil is useful both for generating power, and to automate a lot of chemicals that are important for progression. As you progress, you will be able to get more of it, and get it faster, as well as process it in new ways that improve on the setup that you were using before. It is not a required path for progression in the pack, but it is a very useful one, should you choose to follow it.%n%nThe best way to start working with oil is to extract it from the surface. Oil spouts are visible without having to dig down, and they can be interacted with by using a Pump placed above them, alongside a generator that feeds it some power. You can use some of the Oil to generate this power for now.

# Quest: Simple Distillation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ba8.name=Simple Distillation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ba8.desc=As rich as Oil is, it's hardly useful for anything in this state. One of the most important parts in the processing chain is distillation, which separates the components of this black mixture from their difference in density, or how "heavy" they are. You can do this in a Distillery, starting in LV, but only one of the fractions can be obtained at a time: you must choose which one you want.%n%nLighter fractions are generally more useful than heavier ones, but that doesn't mean that lightest is best. For now, going for Sulfuric Light Fuel is the best option, since it will become a good source of power after being treated. Don't use the Oil to power these machines, stick to Steam until you can use something better.%n%n§3You can find info about the other fractions in the LV tab!

# Quest: Dessulfurizing
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000baf.name=Dessulfurizing
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000baf.desc=After distillation, the fluid you got still isn't that good. It can be used for power, but it's almost as bad as Oil itself unless you remove the sulfuric content it has. This applies for all the portions that can be distilled from Oil, and as such it's a required step regardless of which one you're working with. %n%nTo get clean Light Fuel, the sulfur needs to be drawn out with something that reacts with it, in a Chemical Reactor. What you need is Hydrogen, a relatively common gas that can be electrolyzed from water, or from specific ores (check NEI for all the possible sources). After reacting, you will get Hydrogen Sulfide and the clean Light Fuel, which can be further processed or burned for power at this stage.

# Quest: Light Fuel Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb0.name=Light Fuel Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb0.desc=Light Fuel is a great power source in LV, for several reasons. Not only is it much more power-dense than Steam, which means that you need a smaller amount of it to get the same EU amount, but the generators that can burn it have a higher fuel efficiency than the Steam ones. Even wooden fluid pipes will be enough to transport this fuel!%n%nThat said, your old generators will not accept Light Fuel, so you will have to make some Diesel Generators to get power out of it. You'll still get one LV amp out of each, which means you might have to make more if you are running several machines at once. By the time you build your first Electric Blast Furnace, you will want 4 of these feeding it power.

# Quest: Basic Cracking
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb1.name=Basic Cracking
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb1.desc=Despite what the Distillery recipe might have led you to believe, there are many more fractions of Oil than the four you could choose from. However, to get the rest of the oil byproducts, you need to split these four into the others, a process known as cracking. To crack the fuels, they must not be sulfuric, and you will need either Hydrogen (hydro-cracking) or Steam (steam-cracking) to successfully crack. Your Hydrogen source for dessulfurizing is hopefully good enough to sustain hydro-cracking, and the Steam you were previously using for power can now be useful to get more out of the Oil you're pumping.%n%nHeavy Fuel, Light Fuel, Refinery Gas and Naphtha can each be cracked both ways, and with three different intensities: lightly, moderately or severely cracked. This means that each portion has 6 different cracking options, and the products of distilling them can be cracked once more! There are a lot of options here, but a few of them stand out for their usefulness.%n%nThe first one you should attempt starts with Refinery Gas, instead of Light Fuel, so switch your Distillery to produce that, and get some Steam.

# Quest: Early Ethylene
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb2.name=Early Ethylene
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb2.desc=In LV, cracking fuels is only possible in a Chemical Reactor, which has a lower efficiency than the Oil Cracker multiblock that is available at HV. That said, it is still a great source of some fluids, one of which being Ethylene, the precursor to Polyethylene, the first plastic that can be produced and a required part of progression in the pack. To obtain Ethylene from Oil, the best way to go is to severely steam-crack Refinery Gas.%n%nSimply put the Refinery Gas and the Steam in a Chemical Reactor with the correct circuit (check NEI) and then distill the cracked Refinery Gas. It can give a lot of different outputs, so make sure you choose the right one. After doing this, you'll have successfully processed Oil, both for power and for byproducts. Congratulations!

# Quest: Oil Drilling Rig
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bab.name=Oil Drilling Rig
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bab.desc=In the MV tier, Oil gets a big boost in its effectiveness, and becomes a fantastic powergen option for anyone wanting to switch off Steam, if they haven't done it already. It becomes difficult to use Steam as the only power source in this tier, so you should find a more reliable way to get power.%n%nOf course, you might already be using Light Fuel as your power source of choice, but a different question might have popped up in your mind by now: is there a better way to get Oil? Perhaps you have run short, or perhaps not. Either way, there is a multi unlocked in this tier that can greatly facilitate the automation of Oil input into your Distillery. That multi is the Oil Drilling Rig, which can pump it from below bedrock, but only if there is some in the current chunk, which means that you will have to scan the chunks around you to find it.%n%nThere is a quest for this rig in the Multiblock Goals tab. Go check it out!

# Quest: Oil Reservoirs
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb4.name=Oil Reservoirs
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb4.desc=Unlike the oil spouts that are visible on the surface, the underground reservoirs cannot be seen or measured without the use of specific tools. To find one, you can make a Seismic Prospector and power it by using some kind of explosive (there is a quest for this, which gives the necessary items as rewards). After it has finished working, using a Data Stick on it will give back the raw information from the prospecting, which needs to be put in a Scanner, and then into a Printer, which will give back some pages. Make a book from those pages and you will be able to read the information about reservoirs, and also ores found in the vicinity.%n%nUpon finding a reservoir, you can see the type of oil and its amount within an area of 8x8 chunks. There are five types of Oil in reservoirs, not to be confused with the four portions obtained after oil distillation:%n%nOil - The same as what is found in oil spouts, and usually the kind you want;%nRaw Oil - Gives a lot of Naphtha;%nLight Oil - Gives mostly Sulfuric Gas, not useful in general;%nHeavy Oil - Gives mostly Heavy Fuel, handy if you need some for Diesel or other purposes;%nNatural Gas - Turns into Refinery Gas when reacted with Hydrogen;%n%nThe amount of Oil in the reservoir is very important! Values in the 400s or above are good, and slowly decrease over time as the Oil is pumped, which means that large reservoirs will last for a very long time. If you find one, it's unlikely you'll run out until much later in progression.

# Quest: More Oil Options
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb8.name=More Oil Options
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb8.desc=Alongside the Oil Drilling Rig, there are other sources you can explore. For Heavy Oil, a good source might be Oilsands Ore, which is found in rare veins at high altitudes. If you find one, you will have a large amount of Heavy Fuel to make Diesel with after processing.%n%nThere are also renewable sources of Oil, namely from IC2 crops and bees. The Oilberry crop can produce it indefinitely, but at a very slow rate, whereas bees can do it much faster, particularly Refined Bees, but they are much harder to obtain.%n%nYou can also get more out of the Oil by cracking it in specific ways. Lightly Hydrocracked Heavy Fuel, for example, gives 60%% of the input amount as Light Fuel, which can be helpful if you have an excess of Heavy, and not enough Light to make Diesel.

# Quest: More Hydrogen
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb5.name=More Hydrogen
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb5.desc=With more Oil in your hands, you are sure to have problems with the other inputs you need. Hydrogen is required to get any type of clean byproduct, and the amount you need scales with the speed at which your Chemical Reactors work. It is possible to get a lot of it from ores, and mining out a Limonite vein will get you enough to last a long while, but it will eventually run out. Which automatic sources can you choose from?%n%nThe simplest option is to electrolyze water. You can just keep feeding water for free, but it's a slow and inefficient process, although it also gives you Oxygen. You will need a few Electrolyzers running to keep it going at a decent pace. %n%nAn alternative option is to do this, but with salt water, obtained from Salty Root, if you have delved into IC2 crops. You will also get Chlorine that you will need very often in the next two tiers.%n%nLastly, did you know that most of the oil byproducts are organic compounds, and as such are made mostly of Carbon and Hydrogen? You can electrolyze most of them to get these elements, at a faster rate than water, but only if you have leftovers. Methane is one of the choices that you might have stockpiling. However, note that these byproducts often have fuel values and it's often better to use them as fuel to then electrolyze (salt) water.%n%nEither way, you will need Electrolyzers. Build some to continue!

# Quest: Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb6.name=Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb6.desc=There is a better way to get fuel from Oil in MV, but you will need to expand into other fractions instead of just using Light Fuel. The next step is Diesel, and it is a mix of 5 buckets of Light Fuel with 1 bucket of Heavy Fuel, turning into 6 buckets of Diesel that each have a higher fuel value than the fuel used in LV.%n%nTo automate this from regular Oil, you will need another Distillery and Chemical Reactor, and finally a Mixer to put the fuels together. There are other possible sources of Heavy Fuel, mentioned on another quest in this chain, which can be of assistance if the input of Oil into the setup isn't very high. You will also need more Hydrogen, so get on it!

# Quest: Diesel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb7.name=Diesel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb7.desc=Finally, the oil of the gods. At least, early gods.%n%nDiesel, as a power source, has widely been known as the optimal choice all the way up to EV, when you unlock the ability to make nukes. It can be further upgraded into Cetane-Boosted Diesel in HV, by adding another chemical chain to it, but a fuel value of 480k EU on a fuel that needs so few machines to be made is quite exceptional. It should be automated as soon as possible, to ensure that you won't run out of power when you need it the most.%n%nAt this stage, you can use either LV or MV Diesel Generators. Using the LV ones will mean you need to make more of them, and more pollution, but they have 95%% fuel efficiency compared to MV's 90%%. It's a difference, but an automated Diesel setup is unlikely to be affected by a 5%% change in efficiency.%n%nAs you progress, fuel will become more and more power-dense, but also need more steps automated. The next tier is much harder than this one, so get ready!

# Quest: Distillation Tower
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bac.name=Distillation Tower
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bac.desc=In HV, your oil processing options soar to new levels of complexity, and efficiency. Many of the processing multis that can be used are unlocked in this tier, and one of the most iconic is the Distillation Tower, the direct upgrade of the Distillery.%n%nThis tower can do actual fractional distillation, a process used in real life petrochemistry to separate oil into many different parts, based on their density. The tall structure is required for the process, because the different densities force the chemicals to settle at different heighs, sitting above the others that are heavier than them. If the outputs of these recipes aren't ordered by density, though, don't complain to the developers, it isn't always fully realistic.%n%nThat said, the Distillation Tower replaces Distilleries by outputting every chemical that you can choose from, all at once, from the same amount of input. This means that the tower is both more efficient, and also allows automation of all the outputs at the same time, but this comes at a cost: the controller needs EV circuits, which require a built Cleanroom, and the structure blocks are mostly made of Stainless Steel. Not only that, but the tower's height depends on the recipe, since each output needs its own height level to successfully be extracted. A max-height, 12-block tall DT can cost almost a dozen stacks of stainless to build, a very expensive multi for the tier.%n%nInstead of doing that, the first DT you should build is a 5-block tall one, to distill the Oil you're pumping out of reservoirs. Doing this, you can get all the fractions at once, for a reasonably cheap multi, compared to its maximum size.

# Quest: Using All the Fractions
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb9.name=Using All the Fractions
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb9.desc=After getting all the oil fractions at once, what is a player supposed to do with them? They'll pile up in the tanks or output hatches, and the Distillation Tower will keep running even if it cannot output something; everything that cannot be output will just be voided instead, and it's in your best interest to avoid this waste. What do, then?%n%nFirst off, it's important to note that almost everything you get from Oil can be processed into even more things. Whether or not the step is worthwhile is a different story altogether, and most of them aren't. That said, you're free to look through NEI or the spreadsheet to decide what you want to do, and how you want to do it. The charm of a processing chain like this, at least for me, is that it lets you choose your own path and gives you the information to know how to best utilize it.%n%nSecond off, Oil is a major source of byproducts, many of which will be needed to create other materials that are necessary, or simply helpful in progression. However, this isn't the only way to obtain most of them, and you might already found other sources, especially if you've dabbled in the Benzene or the Biomass chains. It's imperative that you automate most of them, but the way you do it is up to you.%n%nNow, for the four fractions that you get from regular Oil. Up until now, the power generation needed both Light Fuel and Heavy Fuel processing, and Refinery Gas already proved to be a good source of Ethylene. What can these be used for, in case you can build more DTs to process the cracked fluids? Roughly speaking, these are the possibilities:%n%nLight Fuel: You will most likely be using most, or all of this to make Diesel. If you do have leftovers, moderately hydrocracking it is a good source of Propene, and lightly hydrocracking is the best source for Octane. These two are important, but only in EV, for epoxy and powergen, specifically;%n%nHeavy Fuel: If only working with regular Oil, a lot of this will also be consumed to make Diesel. However, it's important to get more of it automated, since it can be distilled directly to make three fantastic byproducts: Toluene, Phenol and Benzene. All of them are important for progression, so make sure you pay attention to this recipe. Toluene is especially useful in HV, as you will need many buckets of it to be able to get into EV, when making your first rocket;%n%nNaphtha: You could distill it in a Distillation Tower, but keep in mind that you need to build a max-height one to cover the entire recipe. However, if you do it, you will have most of the Oil byproducts automated meaning that it's worth it to tackle this challenge when you get comfortable with making lots of Stainless Steel; it also has a good burn value, so if you don't need these byproducts, best just use it for power.%n%nRefinery Gas: You're probably already distilling this for Ethylene. You could switch this recipe to a Distillation Tower and a Oil Cracking Unit (see next quest) to gain more output and some useful byproducts.

# Quest: Special Rubber from Oil
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bbc.name=Special Rubber from Oil
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bbc.desc=Another one of the Oil "specials" is Butadiene. It can be used in a few ways, including power, but where it shines is in making advanced rubber, specifically Styrene-Butadiene Rubber. You can make it in HV, but it is not required to have an improved rubber until the start of IV. There is a questline for this in the HV tab, so go check it out.%n%nThere is an equivalent alternative, Silicone Rubber, made from other inputs. They are mostly interchangeable, but they each have some unique use that makes it so you should have a good supply of both. 

# Quest: Distilled Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bbd.name=Distilled Heavy Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bbd.desc=You don't always have to crack the base fuels to get useful chemicals out of them. The best example of this is Heavy Fuel, whose recipe only has 3 outputs, but they're all excellent. This is the perfect format for a Distillation Tower automation, so get on it as soon as you can, you won't regret it!%n%nAs a sidenote, all of these are power-dense, and can be used for power if you stockpile a lot of them. Benzene is the first one you should use for this purpose, if you wish to do it, because the other two are core chemicals for required progression in HV and EV. However, Benzene can also turn into several useful chemicals, so don't burn it all for power.

# Quest: Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bba.name=Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bba.desc=Another HV multi, and another Stainless Steel sink. Not only that, but it needs 16 coils to work! There is a quest about this multi in the Multiblock Goals tab, as per usual.%n%nDespite being expensive, this is an important multiblock to build. It does the cracking recipes like the Chemical Reactor does, and you might even be tempted to make an LCR for this purpose, since it's cheap and can do many recipes at once, but the Oil Cracker is much more efficient and gives several bonuses when used (check the tooltip for more information). As it stands, it's a higher initial investment that will pay off in the long run, many times over, and in this pack everything takes a long time, so get on it!

# Quest: Boosting the Diesel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bbb.name=Boosting the Diesel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bbb.desc=As you might have guessed, extra byproducts is not the only thing that HV does with Oil. On top of that, you can further improve the main fuel that you use for power, and this builds on the previous tier, as Diesel did from Light Fuel. As before, you will need to mix the fuel you have with something else to improve it, but it is not a direct byproduct this time. Instead, it's a chemical that requires a complicated processing chain to produce, at a much higher EU cost, with only a tiny amount needed to create the next fuel, Cetane-Boosted Diesel.%n%nTo make this additive, Tetranitromethane (TNM), you will need to source several chemicals you might have not used yet. I hope you have some Distillation Towers handy, because they will be very useful for this.

# Quest: Ammonia Source
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bbf.name=Ammonia Source
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bbf.desc=One of the components of Tetranitromethane is Nitric Acid, which is made from Nitrogen Dioxide, and this from Nitrogen Oxide, which is ultimately created from Ammonia. You can do a small Chemical Reactor chain to do this line of recipes, but the better option is to make an LCR and use the circuit 24 recipe to turn Ammonia and Oxygen directly into Nitric Acid.%n%nYou'll still need to automate Ammonia, though, and there are two main ways of doing this. One of the options is to create it directly from Nitrogen and Hydrogen, but this recipe consumes a lot of EU. The other option is to switch to the biological side of things and get it from the DT recipe of Fermented Biomass, but this requires a whole another setup with sapling automation, a Pyrolyse Oven and some other machines, so don't do it unless you're interested in getting the other outputs of that recipe. It, however, might be a good option if you don't have those yet. Either way, automate your Ammonia.%n%n

# Quest: Acetone and Ethenone
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bbe.name=Acetone and Ethenone
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bbe.desc=Another ingredient in the making of TNM is Ethenone, which can be made directly from Acetone. This one is a little more organic, which is to say it's much easier to automate if you chose Benzene or Biomass. From those routes, you can get it from a Wood Vinegar DT, or reacting Acetic Acid with Calcite Dust from a Fermented Biomass DT (get the calcite from electrolyzing Fertilizer). If you used biomass to get Ammonia, you can do it this way.%n%nIf not using plants, though, there are other ways to automate this. Ethenone can be made directly from Acetic Acid and Sulfuric Acid, and this last one should already be automated from cleaning the sulfuric waste from the oil fractions. Acetic Acid, on the other hand, is a mix of Oxygen and Ethylene, a combo that you might have already automated to make Polyethylene. If not, this a good time to do so. %n%nThe amount of Ethenone you need to make a lot of Cetane-Boosted Diesel is small, so it's unlikely that you'll run out of Sulfuric Acid for this. Make sure you automate it all, though.

# Quest: Tetranitromethane as Additive
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc0.name=Tetranitromethane as Additive
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc0.desc=If both Nitric Acid and Ethenone are automated, then you can now get TNM effortlessly!%n%nIf you look at the recipe, you'll see that you need a lot more Nitric Acid than anything else. Given that Ammonia is the most power-hungry recipe, this is what will cut down into the fuel efficiency at the end, but not nearly enough to discourage the creation and use of CBD. Not only that, but if you check the uses of TNM, you'll see that you can treat Biodiesel the same way, although at a higher cost due to its lower fuel value, if you happened to have it.

# Quest: Cetane-Boosted Diesel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc1.name=Cetane-Boosted Diesel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc1.desc=If you made it here, then you should be ready to make Cetane-Boosted Diesel flow into your generators by itself. Congratulations!%n%nOil is still the best power option in HV, building up from what you used in LV. This CBD you've made will help fuel your EBFs, get into space and then handle the increased power needs that EV will throw at you, especially if you want to make an AE2 network for quick automation. Your singleblock generators are at the lowest efficiency yet, 85%%, but the fuel you use now has a fuel value of 1 million EU per bucket, a very powerful liquid compared to any other you could make at this time.%n%nI'll see you on EV. Good luck when you make it there.

# Quest: Generator Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bae.name=Generator Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bae.desc=Welcome to EV! If you thought the previous tier had a big jump in oil processing, you are correct, but now it's going to jump up all over again!%n%nThis tier does not unlock new processing multis like HV did, but it does bring better, much better generators. From now on, your main generators options will almost always be multiblocks, unless you need an easy-to-move generator for a multiblock miner or something similar. For your diesel fuels, the next step is the Large Combustion Engine (LCE), and there is a quest for it on the Multiblock Goals tab as usual. This, however, is a big investment in Titanium, amongst other things, so I hope you have that processing automated already.%n%nIf you boost the LCE, you will get both a huge boost in EU/t and efficiency. While an HV Diesel Generator had an output of 512 EU/t at 85%% efficiency, this expensive multi outputs 6144 EU/t at 150%% efficiency! Make sure you have an EV Buffered Dynamo Hatch that can handle this output.%nThere is an equivalent turbine for gases, like the Refinery Gas you might be using to power your oil processing setup, which is cheaper to build but its performance depends on the turbine placed inside it, and you won't be able to get near the levels of the LCE unless you get some Tungstensteel, and a good metal like Shadow Metal.

# Quest: Boiler and Super Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc3.name=Boiler and Super Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc3.desc=With the advancements in building materials you've made until now, a new kind of generator has been unlocked. The Large Boilers you might have looked at before, and perhaps used, change when you reach Titanium, and if you build one of those, you will get something quite different from the tiers before.%n%nTo start, most burnable items don't work here. These advanced boilers need to burn much hotter, and as such they only accept specific fuels. The fuel of interest here is one of two, who are built in a sort of chain, in a similar fashion as to how Diesel and CBD worked. There is Solid Super Fuel, and Magic Solid Super Fuel, and they are both created from some coal-like block, some binder and some liquid fuel. You can use CBD for this, but Heavy Fuel and LPG are also options.%n%nWhy go through this route, though? The answer is that this extra processing, although it is difficult to automate, creates fuel that is much more efficient than the fuels that were put into it, and this is because the advanced Large Boilers are slow burners that output Superheated Steam, instead of regular one. This also means that they will need two turbines to convert all the steam into EU, and even more if the amount produced is too much for them. If fuel efficiency is something you're looking for, you can tackle this challenge and further process your CBD into something even more powerful.

# Quest: Magic Super Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc5.name=Magic Super Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc5.desc=Solid Super Fuel is an excellent fuel to burn in the Titanium Boiler, but you can do something even better than that. With a touch of magic, you can make yet another solid fuel with 50%% more fuel value than the last one, but it's very likely that you will need Thaumcraft progression to automate this fully, should you wish to do so.%n%nIf you do want to do it, I recommend you also find a way to automate Coal, from IC2 crops for example, because the recipes that use it is much more efficient on liquid fuel than the other coals. You will also end up making more boilers, perhaps a quad Titanium Boiler, which will surely force you to increase the amount of Steam Turbines you'll have to make, but there is a catch here: you can screwdriver the turbines into Loose mode, which significantly decreases their efficiency but boosts their speed by something like 8 times, depending on the turbine you're using. Given that this process already boosts the efficiency of your fuels a lot, you may want to lose some of it to keep your number of turbines low.%n%nI'll leave the planning up to you.

# Quest: Superpowered Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc2.name=Superpowered Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc2.desc=As did all tiers until now, the EV tier introduces a new type of bigger, better liquid fuel to burn on engines, High-Octane Gasoline. However, this one doesn't use the previous fuel, and instead takes a different oil-based route, which means that the CBD you have is of no use in this processing chain.%n%nAlso as before, the amount of processing you will need is greatly increased, and you can expect to need a lot more DTs, Oil Crackers, LCRs and other machines. You will also have to automate the input of materials from other sources, since Oil cannot provide you with everything anymore. You can overclock the multis you have, or build more of them, your choice. In the end, you'll have a fuel that is 2.5x more powerful than CBD, at an impressive fuel value of 2.5 million EU, and more byproducts than you could ever imagine. %n%nYou might have to crack one of the four oil fractions into the other ones, and you will surely need to pump Oil faster and faster to keep up with the power needs that will come when jumping to IV. I do recommend you use AE2 to automate the setup, relying on fluid P2Ps to transport fluids around, because it will make your life easier, even if it's harder to start and learn the setup. Either way you go, don't forget, you have to automate it.%n%n§4Work on making these important EV multis to continue.

# Quest: Improved Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc4.name=Improved Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc4.desc=Have you built an Oil Cracker? Have you checked its coils? This multi gets a significant discount to EU/t when upgrading the coils, but it caps at HSS-S, at a maximum of 50%% discount. If you are still using low-tier coils, this is a great time to upgrade them to Nichrome and enjoy a 30%% discount. You could also do TPV.%n%nBy the way, you can wall-share Oil Crackers, just like DTs, LCRs and many other multis, and doing this will save on the amount of coils you need!%n%n§3You only need to do one of the two tasks.

# Quest: Raw Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc6.name=Raw Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc6.desc=At this point, you have almost all the additives needed to transform basic gasoline into the powerful HOG. What you'll need to do next is to create the gasoline itself, and this begins with Raw Gasoline. It has four different inputs, and each of them is sourced in a different way, but none of them are new: Naphtha and Refinery gas are well-known to you, Methanol was created in the previous quest and Acetone was explained in the "Acetone and Ethenone" quest in HV.%n%nAn important detail here is that Raw Gasoline is 80%% Naphtha. It can be obtained in large quantities from raw oil. If you are not pumping raw oil, you will most likely find the amount you get to be short. But this problem has already been solved! Your source of Octane, if processed in a DT as explained, will also crack the Light Fuel into a lot of Naphtha that you can use here to compensate for the low amount you get from Oil. If you get low on Light Fuel, you can also crack Heavy Fuel to get some.

# Quest: Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bca.name=Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bca.desc=Raw Gasoline is raw, obviously. To make it a proper fuel, it needs something explosive mixed in with it... what could you have that is considered explosive? Maybe the TNT, or what it's made of?%n%nYou have Toluene automated already, right? Get on it.

# Quest: Zooming with Nitrous
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc8.name=Zooming with Nitrous
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc8.desc=Nitrous Oxide, N2O, also known as nitro. It makes cars go really fast for short bursts. In reality, it is a source of extra oxygen when mixed in with the fuel during combustion, allowing it to be consumed faster and also release energy faster, but at the risk of "knocking", detonating the fuel out of its intended boundaries and possibly destroying the engine. %n%nTo avoid this, something else needs to be mixed in this HOG to prevent your generators from exploding, right? Luckily for you, such an option exists and it will be presented after this quest. For now, though, you can focus on automating Nitrous Oxide by mixing Nitrogen with Oxygen. These are the two main products of distilling air, so you can obtain them in one step, but you probably have chosen your source of these gases at this point, so use what you have.

# Quest: Speeding with Octane
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc9.name=Speeding with Octane
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc9.desc=One of the components of High-Octane Gasoline, as the name implies, is Octane. It is so important to improve the fuel because of something called "octane rating", which measures how much the fuel resists compression without detonating. The energy that vehicles get to move around comes from this detonation, but being able to apply more compression allows for engine designs that are more efficient, but need the fuel to resist that increased force without detonating. That said, any of these fuels can be run in the engines you use, so the way to represent this efficiency bonus is in the fuel value.%n%n(There is a multi in the next tier that only runs on HOG, though. Don't forget it.)%n%nHow is Octane obtained, then? In the last tier, it was explained as coming from Light Fuel, and this is still how you should, and can obtain it: lightly hydrocracked Light Fuel gives some Octane, so put a DT for it and leave your Diesel needs behind. It's time to move on.

# Quest: Pushing with Anti-Knock Agent
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc7.name=Pushing with Anti-Knock Agent
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bc7.desc=If you want your generators to last, you'll want to make this. In fact, since safety is always the priority, you can't make HOG without this Anti-Knock Agent, a mixture that keeps the fuel from damaging the engine even when it is this powerful. There are two paths to get this automated: one with an LCR recipe, and the other with a DT. The LCR option is cheaper to build, as per usual, but it consumes considerably more power than the DT path, so this quest will focus on the latter. As before, having an initial higher investment to save energy in the long run is the way to go.%n%nThe DT path is a cycle between a Mixer and the tower itself, where each distillation extracts a bit of Anti-Knock Agent from the MTBE Reaction Mixture, and will need to be mixed again. The two inputs needed for the setup are Butene and Methanol. Butene is obtainable from any of the max-height DT distillations, and Methanol from a mixture of Hydrogen and Carbon Dioxide/Carbon Monoxide. If you have a Fermented Biomass setup, you will already have CO2 ready to go, and Hydrogen can be sourced from a variety of ways.%n%nMake this cycle, and you'll have a safe fuel.

# Quest: High Octane Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bcb.name=High Octane Gasoline
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bcb.desc=Gasoline is a regular fuel, as I'm sure you know. Nothing special about it, it's the same as Diesel but with a different density, for different engines. In real life, it's incredibly useful for the average person, but in GTNH it's mostly replaced by Diesel. However, that is about to change.%n%nThis step is by far the most complicated one in the entire chain, but you already automated all the additives you need, so this is just a matter of mixing. This is the EV step, the final step, so put your chemicals together. Add Octane to help the fuel resist compression after putting in the explosive Toluene, mix in the nitrous to juice it up and finish by controlling it with Anti-Knock Agent. Mix this all with Gasoline and you have HOG, the most powerful diesel fuel in the game.%n%nThere is more progression to the oil processing, and more quests from here, but this is it for fuel improvements. What is left for you is unlocking, and building even better generators that can take full advantage of how powerful HOG is. Nuclear Power is likely to be your next step in power, as diesels cannot last forever, but you can still continue through this path.%n%nOh, and congratulations! You have earned this reward.

# Quest: The Era of Multis
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bad.name=The Era of Multis
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bad.desc=What does this mean, "the era of multis"? I've built so many multis already!%n%nWell, yes, but now it's all multiblocks. There are still singleblock machines for all the tasks they're needed for, but at IV the newer GT++ multis become available, or at least most of them, which can do the same jobs of bending, extruding, extracting, amongst others, but with higher initial investments and many bonuses to their processing. Remember what I said before about higher initial investments being worth it?%n%nThat said, there isn't a new oil processing chain in IV, you only improve what you already have. If there was a step in the chain that was running too slow, and you needed to add more machines to it or overclock, it's likely that there is now a multi that can take over that role by itself. Tungstensteel is usually an important part of these things, so get it automated in anticipation of what's to come.

# Quest: Largest Oil Drain
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bcc.name=Largest Oil Drain
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bcc.desc=One way or another, you will need to get Oil faster. Reservoirs can get really big, but the rig only pumps from a portion of them... until now. With a few stacks of Tungstensteel, you can put together the tier 4 of the Oil Rigs, and suck up all the fluid from a reservoir at once, covering the full 8x8 chunk size from a single spot. %n%nIf you need even faster Oil input, build more rigs! They'll draw from the same pool, and exhaust it together. If you put them on adjacent reservoir chunks, you can draw multiple full reservoirs at once and feed them into a central location, and this transportation becomes even easier with Ender Tanks, which are unlocked in this tier.

# Quest: Buffered Dynamo
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bcd.name=Buffered Dynamo
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bcd.desc=Another use for a few stacks of Tungstensteel is a new, even more powerful generator, but you can't run it just yet. Just like the LCE before it, the IV generator can't be run without a dynamo hatch that is powerful enough to keep up with the output, and in this case it applies to both the boosted and unboosted modes.%n%nWhat that means is that you need an IV Buffered Dynamo Hatch. The power will be worth it.

# Quest: Extreme Combustion Engine
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bce.name=Extreme Combustion Engine
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bce.desc=Very similar to the LCE in most aspects, the Extreme Combustion Engine was created to close the gap between the diesels and more advanced forms of powergen, mainly nuclear fusion. However, the main thing they differ on is the fuel that they can run, and in this case you're limited to the powerful fuel from the last tier, High Octane Gasoline.%n%nThat's right, only this fuel will work, and in exchange the ECE will output more than 10k EU/t. If you add Liquid Oxygen, which you'll need 4 Vacuum Freezers for (3 at HV and 1 at EV), you can keep it boosted permanently, which will send it up to 4 IV amps of power and 150%% fuel efficiency. It's in your best interest to keep this thing going if you want to keep using Oil fuels for power, and the only thing you can rely on is your automated HOG setup, which you might have to, and should improve with the new IV multis as soon as you can, unless you have other sources of power working simultaneously.%n%nAs a last note, there is also an IV equivalent of the Vacuum Freezer, if you want to tackle the Liquid Oxygen needs that way. It's more power efficient, look it up on the GT++ tab.

# Quest: Super Distillation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bcf.name=Super Distillation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bcf.desc=Your tallest and closest buddy, the Distillation Tower. You've relied on it so much, haven't you? It's time to take it down.%n%nNo, not really, but you can do better now. The catch is that the upgrade to this, the Dangote Distillus, is special in the sense that its crafting recipe is in the Chemical Plant, and the one you have to build for this recipe is very expensive. Should you decide to accept the costs, though, you can build a Dangote in much the same way as the DT, and even upgrade it to tier 2 for better performance (look in NEI for a Distillus Chip, you have to put it in the controller). %n%nIn summary, this multi runs faster than the DT by doing parallels, a recipe done multiple times at once. A quad DT that you were using to distill Oil can be replaced by a Dangote, and so on. Since distillation is usually a bottleneck in speed for oil processing, this multi should prove useful.

# Quest: Maxed Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bd0.name=Maxed Oil Cracker
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bd0.desc=How many oils have you cracked at this point? No matter the number, you can do it cheaper. Once you reach HSS-G coils, you will have achieved the maximum EU/t discount of 50%% on your Oil Crackers, and enjoy the full array of benefits that they can provide you. Don't forget to overclock them if they're running slow, the energy cost is minimal at this point.

# Quest: Super Fuel At The Top
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bd1.name=Super Fuel At The Top
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bd1.desc=I was kidding, there's one more step in Oil, but it isn't really a better fuel, it's just the Tungstensteel Boiler.%n%nThis multi operates in the same fashion as the Titanium one. It needs a Super Fuel, it produces Superheated Steam and it makes you build a bunch of Steam Turbines to actually get power out of the fuel it consumes. The output energy of a single one of these boilers, at 100%% efficiency, is 16k EU/t, so you'll need many turbines per boiler. You can build them like that, if you wish to, but at this point the Loose mode on those turbines is really useful. The efficiency hit is big, yes, but the Tungstensteel Boiler is 300%% as efficient as the Bronze one, and a single Magic Solid Super Fuel burns for 4,5M EU at 100%% turbine efficiency. Look at the amount of CBD you need to make one super fuel, and then you can decide if you want to tackle this super finale.%n%nYes, it's the end, basically. There is a couple of things you can still do, but I'll give you this as an award for having pushed through essentially all the Oil content in the pack. It has been a long journey, and I hope that you found it worthwhile and enjoyable.

# Quest: Breaking the Mold
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bd2.name=Breaking the Mold
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bd2.desc=Welcome, o' Baron of Oil. For you who has completed the 5 questlines of oil processing, a new chapter awaits you.%n%nThe following quests are not guidelines on how to work with oil. In reality, they are meant for tiers where you're not supposed to be using this kind of power anymore. However, if you do want to continue it, and push it as far as it can go, the following are a few challenges that you can take on, mostly for bragging rights.%n%nAll these challenges are for the tiers after IV. Some of them are for LuV, others need further progression. Good luck!

# Quest: Ultimate Distillation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bd3.name=Ultimate Distillation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bd3.desc=The Dangote Distillus is not enough for the goals of an oil baron. You might have heard about "mega" multiblocks, namely the Mega EBF, but did you know that a Distillation Tower equivalent exists?%n%nIt does the same thing as the Dangote, parallels, but it does 256 at a time, and is much, much bigger than anything you've built so far. My challenge to you is to build a max-height, full-sized Mega Distillation Tower, and come out of your efforts with the biggest multiblock that the pack has to offer. You will need more, much more casings than what the quest asks for, but your inventory is not big enough to hold the full amount that will need to build this monstrosity.

# Quest: Hyperheated Steam
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bd4.name=Hyperheated Steam
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bd4.desc=If there is someone who found themselves invested in the Large Tungstensteel Boilers, this one is for you. Through the pollution, the multiblock spamming and the chained processing lines you need to get here, you will find that this is a lot of heat for one boiler to handle. Why not make two quad boilers?%n%nYou might be thinking about the number of turbine multis you need to withstand this, but fret not! There are extra large turbines, for the extra large steam enthusiast. You will need twelve turbine items for each multi, and you best bring the best ones you can make! Loose mode is up to you, just go wild with your super fuel.%n%n§4You will need an Assembly Line to craft the dynamo needed to complete this quest.§r

# Quest: Universal Fuel Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bd5.name=Universal Fuel Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bd5.desc=This is the most powerful combustion engine that has ever been built. In fact, it's not only that, but also a Gas Turbine and a Rocket Fuel Generator!%n%nThe Universal Chemical Fuel Engine burns fuel with some additives, as did its predecessors, but it runs at a lower efficiency. The 150%% value is a mathematical limit, you cannot reach it without supplying infinite fuel, but this engine compensates by running as fast as fuel is input into it, without the maximum EU/t limitation the others had. The only two things you have to make sure of are that you supply enough Combustion Promoter to keep efficiency up (I'll let you figure the best ratio on your own, but 1:4 promoter:fuel is decent), and that the dynamo can support the EU/t that the generator is outputting.%n%n§9§9§b§4You will need an Assembly Line to craft the dynamo needed to complete this quest. You better burn enough HOG to make it worth!§r 

# Quest: Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb3.name=Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000bb3.desc=This sulfuric waste that came out of the oil fractions could be voided, but it's actually a useful byproduct for your progression. The Hydrogen Sulfide that you obtained, mixed with Water in another Chemical Reactor will give back Diluted Sulfuric Acid, which can be turned into its more concentrated form by distilling it.%n%nSulfuric Acid is one of the most important chemicals in the pack, so make sure to use this opportunity to automate it. It's needed for circuits, amongst other things, so you will need a lot of it.


## Quest Line: Bio for the Masses
betterquesting.questline.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000015.name=Bio for the Masses
betterquesting.questline.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000015.desc=Questline about powergen that comes from plants and trees.

# Quest: Renewable Energy
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c14.name=Renewable Energy
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c14.desc=Despite finding oil spouts in the wild, you might have thought about extending the source of power you have used to reach the age of electricity. Steam was your energy, and burnable items your source of that energy, with wood and charcoal being the most likely candidates for automating your first power generation steps. Steam itself, however, is not the best option for all progression tiers, so the question is: what else can that wood do? That is what this questline will explain.%n%nEach tier you reach will challenge you with bigger power needs. Not only do the energy tiers multiply by 4 every time you go up (32 EU/t for LV, 128 for MV, 512 for HV, etc.), but also the necessary growth of your setups, with more steps and each one becoming more complicated. To sustain all this, you might want a fully automated, infinite source of power and chemicals to handle this pack's progression. To achieve this, following the quests in this chapter is sure to be helpful.%n%nAs a final note, the power outputs of a fully renewable powergen like this are not as efficient as oil, which is the price to pay for being renewable. You will need a bigger machine setup to achieve the same EU/t output, but it is still very viable and worth it if you are willing to make this compromise. On the other hand, building these wood-related setups will give you some interesting chemicals to use in later crafts, chemicals that oil cannot directly create. You can choose one or the other, or just follow both paths at the same time if you're curious. It's up to you.

# Quest: Sourcing Your Wood
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c17.name=Sourcing Your Wood
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c17.desc=When it comes to power from wood, your only options so far have been the wood itself and Charcoal. Both of these are low on energy per item, so you will need a lot of wood to have a decent EU/t output. How, then, can you easily get that much? There are two ways: the automated way, and the non-automated way.%n%nThe automated way can be done with one of several machines, but in LV you only have one option: the LV Crop Manager. It can automatically harvest crops in an area around it and, for this situation, the crop you want is one of several Bonsais. You can get them by planting saplings on cropsticks (there is a lot more information about how crops work in the Forestry and Multifarms page), and most types of saplings are equivalent to one another, although not all of them can be planted as crops. The ones that stand out are Spruce, which give a bit more wood than the others, and Oak, which give Apples alongside the usual wood and saplings, possibly useful for some chemistry later.%n%nThe non-automated way can be done earlier, and it only requires two things: an unbreakable Lumber Axe and trees with a lot of wood, like Sacred Oak, Redwood, or Rainforest Oak. This axe will chop down (most of) the trees and award you with stacks and stacks of wood, much faster than the automated way, but with more work. This process might be useful in the beginning, but you will have to automate the wood input at some point. %n%nComplete one of the tasks and get some wood to continue. 

# Quest: Faster Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c18.name=Faster Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c18.desc=Even if you have more wood, this won't help your power issues that much. Using it directly as fuel isn't going to do much for you as you move forward, and turning it into Charcoal will be very important. You have already built a Coke Oven, maybe more than one, but each one takes 90 seconds to produce one Charcoal, an abysmal rate. Unfortunately, there isn't any faster option in this tier, so you will have to build more of these ovens. How many, exactly?%n%nThere are many different goals you might want to go for, but a good metric for your power needs is a setup with 24 Coke Ovens. This number will create both Charcoal and Creosote Oil at a rate that will run two max-sized LP (Low Pressure) Railcraft Boilers, one solid and one liquid, with the quest for those coming right after this one. If you automate this entire setup, it will produce around 2 amps of MV, which are equivalent to 8 amps of LV, plenty of power for this tier and enough to advance you to the next one.%n%nAfter building these Coke Ovens, you will need to automate them. There are a few ways to do this, but one of the cheapest ones is to use Item Pipes, made with Tin for example, with a Conveyor Module in the wood chest/drawer to put the wood in the ovens, and then one Hopper below each oven, into more Item Pipes, to gather the Charcoal. The Creosote is a bit harder to extract, but you can do it with Tinkers' Faucets on the side of each Coke Oven, with a Wooden Fluid Pipe directly under the faucet. You will need to keep reactivating them with redstone, which means you'll also need a redstone clock (there's a block dedicated to this purpose, named Redstone Clock, from Extra Utilities).

# Quest: Carbon, Chemically
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c15.name=Carbon, Chemically
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c15.desc=How does all of this organic stuff produce energy, anyways? You burn it, that's how! The heat from that burning heats up water into Steam, and this can make a Steam Turbine spin, generating rotational energy that can directly be converted into electricity with spinning magnetic fields. Pretty neat, right? The wood/charcoal provides the combustible material, and the atmosphere provides the oxygen to keep the fire going. With some chemistry, and GTNH magic, we can use these principles to generate power in an alternative way.%n%nIt's pretty much magic, really. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a valid fuel for Gas Turbines, and it can be made with Charcoal and Oxygen. The CO has more power than the Charcoal used to make it, but the additional Oxygen will make this step not worth it if you get it from electrolyzing water or centrifuging air, since the EU needed for those crafts will make this process inefficient. There is, however, a more efficient way to automate Oxygen production, but you will need crops for it.%n%nYour target is Sugar, since electrolyzing it will output Oxygen at almost 1000 EU per bucket. Each bucket of CO produces 24000 EU, made from one Charcoal that produces roughly 16000 EU in Steam, and costing 560 EU per craft. The whole process gives around 6000 EU of free power per Charcoal, around 30%% extra power overall!%n%nTo get automated Sugar from crops, you want Sugar Beets. Sugar Canes do the same thing, but with more EU cost to get the Sugar. There are other possible ways but, for now, just get loads of Sugar.  

# Quest: Burning the Carbon
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c16.name=Burning the Carbon
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c16.desc=If you've automated Carbon Monoxide, you can now burn it directly for EU in a Gas Turbine. It does not use the Steam Turbines that the boilers required, which is a good thing for two reasons: Steam Turbines are less fuel efficient than their Gas or Combustion alternatives, and steam in itself needs large pipes to move it, being much less power dense than gases or diesels. Additionally, you don't even need boilers at all! You can skip them altogether if you invest in this CO route.%n%nYou also get Ashes from this chemical reaction. They can be used in several ways, take a look!

# Quest: Two Big Ovens
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c19.name=Two Big Ovens
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c19.desc=With 24 Coke Ovens automated, you can sustain two big boilers endlessly. The boilers you want to build for this are specifically the Low Pressure Railcraft Boilers, made with Iron, each one as big as they can be, a 3x4x3 of the Boiler Tanks. These multiblocks are expensive, but you will have plenty of power and will consume all the Creosote from your Coke Ovens to keep them running permanently.%n%nThese boilers have a High Pressure variant, though, which need a lot more steel than their cheaper counterparts but can output a lot more Steam. If you somehow gathered a lot of stacks of Steel Ingots, you might think of attempting this, but keep in mind that your Coke Oven setup cannot sustain the input those heated behemoths require to keep running. The same goes for the Large Bronze Boiler, GregTech's own way of improving on your tiny boilers, but with two added problems: you can't produce Charcoal fast enough for it (the output speed of your setup is 3.75 seconds per Charcoal, the LBB needs one every 2 seconds), and it has a terrible efficiency for your Creosote, which means most of its power will be wasted. §6And perhaps, the LBB is MV-gated by circuit, compared to the boiler who is early-LV because of steel.§r%n%nHowever, surprise! The GT++ Semifluid Generators work, and they're very efficient with the Creosote. You can use a few of those coupled with a Large Bronze Boiler, but you will still run into the issue of not producing Charcoal fast enough unless you do something about it. You can choose this as an option and complete this quest, but it's a more "experimental" alternative.

# Quest: No Benzene Yet
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c2d.name=No Benzene Yet
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c2d.desc=This questbook page is supposed to explain the Benzene powergen line, but you might have noticed that you haven't made any Benzene yet. That's because the recipe path to get it from Charcoal has an MV recipe, and you can't just skip straight to MV with the small amount of steam you were using in the Bronze Age. %n%nThere are also other paths for renewable power in this page. They have similar sources, or the same source, but different processing lines, and the entire thing looks like a tree branch, with many different ways in which you can go. The Carbon Monoxide path is one example of this, and there are many more to come in the future.%n%nRegardless of which path you chose to get power from your Charcoal, you can now sustain an EBF comfortably and get power more efficiently. It's recommended that you move away from steam in the next tier, because you will need to transport too much of it to produce good amounts of MV power. Fortunately, you won't need steam at all!

# Quest: The Benzene Tier
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c1a.name=The Benzene Tier
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c1a.desc=Having walked into MV, you are soon going to be able to produce and consume Benzene. It's more efficient than burning the Charcoal in a boiler, but you will still need to provide a lot of wood to make sure you have consistent, abundant power. It's heavily recommended that you automate this wood input, if you haven't already, possibly with an MV Crop Manager instead of the LV one, or with the Crop Harvester from IC2. %n%nFor automation, you're still stuck with using bonsais, not regular trees. HV will provide a few options that don't need crops, but for now you might want to increase your crop stats by crossbreeding. Planting saplings on cropsticks creates 1/1/1 bonsais, which are much slower than their high-stat variants. If you want to invest in crops, you can later use the high stats to get more of a several dozen different items that crops can output, but you should start with Stickreed to develop your crop stats, not bonsais.%n%nDon't throw away your saplings, either! They will be useful later on, so save up as many as you can.

# Quest: Advanced Coke Oven
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c1f.name=Advanced Coke Oven
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c1f.desc=Your power needs quadrupled since the last tier, and it's likely that you're not getting Charcoal fast enough. Instead of adding even more Coke Ovens, why not build an upgraded version of them?%n%nThe caveat is that you won't keep producing Creosote alongside the Charcoal from now on. It makes for decent power in the appropriate generators, and you might have already used it to produce Lubricant. Despite that, you can still get Creosote from processing in the next steps of this questline, so you can still get it if you need it. With that out of the way, let's move on to the Advanced Coke Oven (ACO).%n%nHow is it made? The ACO needs a lot more steps than the normal Coke Ovens, steps centered around Nether materials, cooked in the EBF and then cooled down. The cooling part is normally the Vacuum Freezer's job, as you will see later in progression, but you can't build it yet; because of that, you'll have to use IC2 coolant to finish the bricks used in the ACO. Once you've crafted all the blocks needed for this, you can put it together and start it up, to see what's different from before.%n%nThe speed of this new one is 1 Charcoal per second, or the equivalent to 90 Coke Ovens. The cost of this is the loss of the Creosote, and also that it needs fuel to work, making it so approaximately 1/16 of your Charcoal is lost in this step. Fortunately, you can automate it with item pipes, and the EnderIO conduits make it even simpler. Input wood, input charcoal, output charcoal.%n%nMake one of these multis to continue. Be warned that you might need more!

# Quest: Pyrolyse Oven
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c20.name=Pyrolyse Oven
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c20.desc=Some setups really demand space in your base to work properly. You might have thought that when you finished the Coke Oven automation, but there's also an option in this tier that respects that need for speed by just being a gigantic multiblock: the Pyrolyse Oven.%n%nIn essence, it's the original GregTech large-scale wood processor. It is a massive structure, probably bigger than any other multi you've build before, but it uses simple materials like bronze and steel. If you're able to just throw stacks of those at a controller, you can put this behemoth together and enjoy an alternative to the Advanced Coke Oven that has some extra benefits. Unlike any of the other ovens, this one runs on EU, so you need to route your power back here to process the wood you're feeding it. %n%nWhat makes the Pyro valuable? It outputs a fluid alongside the Charcoal, which you can process for extra power and/or byproducts. Look at NEI to see all the alternatives available to you, this multi can usually output several different fluids, but only one at a time, decided by the circuit inside it. The one to choose at this time is Wood Tar, the same fluid you're extracting from the Charcoal. You get a small constant bonus from having built a Pyro, which is really nice.%n%nHowever, the Pyro uses coils in a similar way to the EBF, and those coils affect the time each recipe takes: if you're using Cupronickel Coils, the recipe time is actually 2x what NEI says! This might be too slow for your needs, so make sure you check how much Charcoal you're getting from here. Kanthal Coils are available in MV, using the IC2 Coolant instead of the Vacuum Freezer.%n%nYou can also boost your Pyro by providing Nitrogen. There are separate recipes for that in NEI.

# Quest: Wood Tar
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c22.name=Wood Tar
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c22.desc=Benzene cannot be extracted directly from Charcoal. To get to it, you need to process the extracted fluid, called Wood Tar. In the past, this was a very slow step, which forced players to spam Fluid Extractors to keep up with the other parts of their Benzene line, but it's a lot faster now. Regardless, you still need more than one Fluid Extractor for each machine used in the step after this one, if you are using LV machines here. %n%nSince it's an LV recipe, you can overclock it with an MV machine, but you'll waste some EU that way (each recipe will cost twice as much EU). To continue, craft either 2 LV Fluid Extractors or 1 MV one.

# Quest: Distilling Benzene
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c45.name=Distilling Benzene
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c45.desc=From Wood Tar, you can selectively filter out the energetic Benzene to use as a power source. This tar is like a fluid equivalent of the Charcoal, and it actually has a lot of useful chemicals hidden inside: to separate them, the tar needs to be heated up to a temperature that will cause some of its components to evaporate, but not others. This is fractional distillation, and the singleblock Distillery, in this case an MV one, can recover only one of the outputs of such distillation.%n%nThere is something that is worth considering, though: Benzene is not the only useful chemical that can be gotten from Wood Tar. In HV, you can get all the outputs at the same time, but right now you can only choose one. Other options that you might want are Toluene and Creosote. The former can be used to make TNT, to do Implosion Compressor crafts, and the latter is useful to make Lubricant, if you ran out of it and are not using Coke Ovens anymore. 

# Quest: Trees Growing Faster
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c24.name=Trees Growing Faster
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c24.desc=No matter which way you used to get wood, you can simplify it. There's nothing much simpler than just pulling out more and more wood from a multiblock that doesn't even grow trees! That's what the Tree Growth Simulator does, with a special input: saws. This multi can replace the bonsais that were used for wood automation, however it is only available in IV. You have two further options in the mean time:%n%nTo continue using bonsais, in case you have gotten good stats on them, you can use the HV version of the Crop Manager, or the multiblock version, the Multifarm. This multi is special because it needs Uranium Rods, which are HV due to needing Eyes of Ender, but it has a massive range to harvest crops, being able to work with 1000+ of them, while only consuming 6 ULV amps when built correctly. It also hydrates and fertilizes automatically, and is much more efficient with the Fertilizer than its competition. Compared to the Crop Manager, it only loses out on the extra drops per harvest.%n%nOther than these two options, you can also grow and harvest trees normally with the EnderIO Farmer, which is a more typical tree automation machine. It's HV-locked like and it's simple, reliable and only needs a bit of power to get the wood you need, at a pretty fast rate. Ideally you want to use an unbreakable lumber axe with a tree type that produces a lot of logs (spruce is decent). To crank out a lot of wood you can then use sprinklers with water or a world accelerator.

# Quest: Fractioned Benzene
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c26.name=Fractioned Benzene
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c26.desc=One of the most important steps is to remove the limitation you had when distilling. Wood Tar turns into Benzene? That's not how it should be, there's much more to get from that tar than what you've been extracting from it. To keep the rest, you need more space in the distillation process, or, more specifically, more height. Each of the fluids that can be separated from within the tar will stick at a different height level, sitting on top of all the others that are more dense than itself.%n%nBasically, you need a multiblock, instead of a singleblock. The Distillation Tower you will need for this recipe has to be at least 6 blocks tall, with 1 input plus 5 outputs. Out of it, you will get Benzene, Toluene and Phenol, which are all viable gases for power alongside being very useful for progression (Toluene for compressing with TNT and moving past HV, Phenol for crafting circuits in the next tier and other chemical lines). You will also get various types of Dimethylbenzene. For now the only one of interest is 1,2-Dimethylbenzene which is a part of the PBI line in IV. Though even that is unfortunately of little use to you right now. You also get Creosote for your Lubricant needs, or a little extra power.%n%nThe Distillation Tower will continue consuming Wood Tar, even if one or more outputs are full: it'll just void the rest! Other than Dimethylbenzene, everything else can be used for power, so try not to waste those things. 

# Quest: Creosote's Work
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c27.name=Creosote's Work
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c27.desc=Your old pal, Creosote Oil, is back in the game! That's right, you can get it automatically from Charcoal processing again, as you did with the first Coke Ovens, and what you can do with it is about the same. The two main purposes it has are power generation and Lubricant, which you will want to use in Cutting Machines, and will also be required in some later multiblocks like the Large Combustion Engine and the Multiblock Miner. Using a Brewery, you can add some Redstone to quickly convert this oil to Lubricant and keep it in stock for whatever machine or craft needs it.%n%nAlternatively, you can get a bit of extra power from this. The fuel value per bucket is much lower than the big three, but it still has an interesting use. When the semifluid generators were broken, and the Creosote wasn't usable in them, there were setups using two max-size LP Railcraft boilers to turn the amount you get from one DT into the EU needed to run it, making that step completely free in terms of power. There were some fine details, such as the Steam Turbines needing to all be LV for the fuel efficiency, but it'd be easier to use semifluid generators from the start. Either way, you can at least remove the EU cost from the DT from the equation, if you wish to.

# Quest: Phenol's Width
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c28.name=Phenol's Width
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c28.desc=This one is not as specialized as Toluene is. It's also more likely that you will be producing it in a Chemical Reactor, or working around it with recipes, if you choose not to use Oil or Benzene for some reason. You're here, though, so you have all of the possibilities, and all of the advantages of skipping through steps in several important chemical lines that accept Phenol, one of the first being epoxy resin. If you check NEI, you can more easily see where this chemical can come in handy.%n%nIt is true, though, that it isn't as required in HV as Toluene is. Since both of them are good power options alongside Benzene, it's preferable that you burn this one for power between the two, if you have to. In the best situation, you won't need to, but it's also acceptable to burn all of the Benzene and some Phenol, while the Toluene gets converted into its gelled form to make several stacks of TNT. Don't discredit the amount of power you can get from this.

# Quest: Toluene's Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c29.name=Toluene's Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c29.desc=Trinitrotoluene. Shorthand, that's TNT, or one of the most popular types of explosive there is. Not only is it popular, but it's a centerpiece of a special type of GTNH crafting: implosion compressing! There are other types of explosives available, but TNT is the best for this purpose.%n%nThat's all fine and dandy, but unfortunately it is not optional. To get past HV, you will need Titanium, and the most reasonable way to accomplish that is to get it from ores found in the Moon, which will need a rocket made of very compressed plates, courtesy of a few stacks of said TNT. To source it, you will need a lot of Toluene, and from there you can make a choice: make regular TNT, or add Nitric Acid to the mix and come out with Industrial TNT, a more powerful version that can, for the most part, craft more items than the cheaper TNT. Some of the renewable powergen processes can output Ammonia, which makes Nitric Acid much easier to produce, so keep that in mind.%n%nToluene, plus TNT or iTNT is what you need. The rocket will thank you later.

# Quest: Further Charcoal Distillation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c2a.name=Further Charcoal Distillation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c2a.desc=The Distillation Tower you've recently unlocked can bring forth many, many more outputs than what you've done so far. If you look at NEI, you might see that there are other Charcoal-related fluids that have recipes in this multi, and this is the time to work with them: doing it all in singleblock Distlleries would be very wasteful.%n%nThe most important part about getting these fluids is the Pyrolyse Oven. If you haven't made one, it's highly recommended that you make at least one. You can upgrade both the energy hatch and the coils used in it to keep it up to speed with everything else, no need to build more than one. Aside from fulfilling the purpose of the Coke Oven, to cook Wood into Charcoal, it gives the choice of which of several fluids it also outputs as it does the processing. Most of the options are potentially useful, but a complete Benzene setup will prefer Charcoal Byproducts because they are, essentially, the complete product.%n%nATTENTION: This setup is technically HV, but it's quite expensive. It's fine if you move to EV first before you build this. It is in no way required to progress in HV.%n%nWith Charcoal Byproducts, the full setup involves DTing that into Wood Tar, Wood Vinegar and Wood Gas, and then DTing all of those into their respective outputs. With one tower for each, you will end up with a quad DT setup, very expensive overall in terms of Stainless Steel, but with huge savings compared to making 4 separate ones. Keep in mind, however, that they will not all have the same height. Additionally, Wood Gas is not as valuable as the other two (although it is a decent Ethylene source), so it's also a good idea to make 2 of the 4 DTs process that, and burn the Wood Gas for the little power it can provide.%n%nAs a final note, the towers do process things slowly. Add Distilleries, if you wish, to get specific outputs.

# Quest: Vinegar into Acetone
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c2b.name=Vinegar into Acetone
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c2b.desc=From Wood Vinegar, one of the useful outputs you can walk away with is Acetone. It's not very easy to craft, needing Calcium Dust and Acetic Acid, which needs Methanol or Hydrogen... instead of all that, you can get it right here, alongside some of the other chemicals in this family tree. %n%nWhat is it for, though? Simple: Epoxy Resin, Cetane-Boosted Diesel, Raw Gasoline and maybe some up-and-coming glue. Want it? Get it, it'll surely prove useful.

# Quest: Sapling Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c25.name=Sapling Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c25.desc=Wood has been a big part of your power generation, and you might have even used other plants or fish for oil. Even if that's true, there is a constant output from your trees that has been left unused all this time: the saplings! No matter which tree you chose to automate, you are surely stockpiling the saplings matching that tree, since there's little that is really useful to do with them. At this point, though, you can set up a decent Biomass setup.%n%nTo clarify, Biomass is just a fluid made from plant stuff. It doesn't need to be saplings, but that's most likely something you have a lot of lying around. On top of that, there are multiple types of Biomass, one of them called Fermented Biomass, which is very similar but different, and the recommended path for you to take, since it needs less steps than the alternatives and gets you to the DT recipe just fine.%n%nAfter this processing line is finished, you will have a lot of new chemicals automated that you won't have from Wood Tar alone. If you are already processing Wood Vinegar, you will have several repeat outputs, though. That said, if you complete this line, you will get Ethanol + Methanol and Ammonia, which make the Cetane-Boosted Diesel process much easier. All of these lines interact with each other, and you can get bigger and bigger returns if you automate several at once!%n%nFor now, focus on putting together the machines needed to get from Saplings to Fermented Biomass. You will need a Compressor, a Pulverizer and a Pyrolyse Oven for this route.

# Quest: Fermented Biomass
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c31.name=Fermented Biomass
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c31.desc=After this biomass leaves the Pyro, you can input it straight into a DT and it will be separated into its component parts. This is one of the tallest towers that you can make with fully renewable powergen and, sadly, not all outputs are useful. However, you'll still get a nice bang for your buck, if you manage to not get lost in NEI in the middle of all this chemistry.%n%nThe following quests will explain some important uses for the outputs of this DT recipe. First, however, you need to get it going, which means you need a lot of Fermented Biomass and a tall enough tower to process it. There is one caveat that you might run into as you try to speed up your machines, which is that saplings don't come fast enough! You can work around this by throwing more plant stuff into the Compressor, and how you solve this is really up to you and what you have.

# Quest: Free For All Fertilizer
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c32.name=Free For All Fertilizer
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c32.desc=You might have heard of the Fertilia crop, which can easily automate the Fertilizer input for your crops, if you're using them. Why bother, though, when you're already getting it from your DT? That's right, you will also be able to automate fertilizing alongside everything else, which is very important for high-statted crops, making all the inputs (energy, water, fertilizer) automated without any outside inputs. Pretty neat, huh?%n%nThat said, you might not be using IC2 crops at all. In that case, you can electrolyze it, and you'll get a lot of free Carbon and Calcite Dust, which you'll certainly use in future chemistry. You can also use the CO2 Gas from the DT to get Carbon, I guess? It's not very useful.

# Quest: Direct Ethylene
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c2c.name=Direct Ethylene
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c2c.desc=Wood Gas has a big portion of barely useful outputs, but also some hidden gems. The hardest one to get, arguably, is Ethylene, since it needs automated Sulfuric Acid alongside the Ethanol you're already getting. DTing Wood Gas is the main way to get Ethylene directly, without worrying about the acid, when it comes to renewable power. This make Polyethylene, an important plastic you've already worked with at this point.%n%nThe caveat is, of course, the small amount that you get in this recipe. Whether or not you set this process up is your choice, but it's generally useful, especially if your main Ethanol source is Wood Vinegar. 

# Quest: Methane Stinks
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c33.name=Methane Stinks
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c33.desc=The output you'll get the most of, in the Fermented Biomass DT, is Methane. 6/10 of the input amount will become Methane, and this makes for the best choice for powering your powergen, even if other outputs can also serve as fuel options. It's important to remember that Methane is used in several important chemical lines, such as PTFE and Silicone Rubber, but you'll get much more of it than you need for those purposes.%n%nThe Methane you get from one DT can power it 4 times. Using 1/4 of your power there, you can fuel the singleblock machines you're using, and the wood automation source as well if you feel like it. Regardless, this setup should fuel itself just fine.

# Quest: Skipped into Ammonia
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c35.name=Skipped into Ammonia
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c35.desc=This one is almost a flex, at times, depending on your future plans. Ammonia is one of the most power-intensive early chemicals to produce, from Nitrogen and Hydrogen, with a slow HV recipe compared to most others being produced quickly. It is used very often, in various stages of progression, often to make Nitric Acid that is used for Industrial TNT, Cetane-Boosted Diesel and other products. From Fermented Biomass, you can get it directly, although only one tenth of the amount of biomass used, 1000 mL to 100 mL of Ammonia.%n%nThe rate at which you're going to get this, just from one HV DT, isn't very fast. DTs are slow by design, and the ratio for Ammonia isn't great, so you can accumulate it if you leave the setup running for a while, but you won't be able to feed it into multiple automations that require it unless you upgrade the DT or make more of them, both of which are easy to do later on. Alternatively, you can choose to void the other outputs and work with singleblock Distilleries instead, but this depends on the rate at which you're inputting saplings. %n%nTo note, Ammonia is required to make Cetane-Boosted Diesel, which you can make from Biodiesel. You can great a good mileage for that just from one Fermented Biomass DT.

# Quest: Ethanols Here
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c34.name=Ethanols Here
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c34.desc=Ethanol and Methanol are two different chemicals, but they are both outputs from DTing Fermented Biomass or Wood Vinegar. Between the two, you can make Ethylene (and then Polyethylene, by adding Sulfuric Acid and Oxygen), Biodiesel, Dense Hydrazine (GT++ rocket fuel, it's very powerful in IV, try it), some chemicals for HOG (EV fuel from crude oil), and many other things such as Chloromethane. For future processing lines, you're going to want to have these stocked up. %n%nThey are both also power sources, if you end up with full super tanks. Their fuel values aren't the best, with Ethanol at 192k and Methanol at 84k, but they are perfectly capable of fueling your powergen setups, leaving your best fuels free to power your main base. Even if you're using them for Biodiesel and Polyethylene at the same time, it's quite likely that you'll have leftovers. If you have the choice to use any of the two in a recipe, choose Methanol, since Ethanol has a lot more EU per bucket to give.%n%n(Also note that you get almost no Ethanol from Wood Vinegar compared to Methanol. On the Fermented Biomass side, the amounts are the same.)

# Quest: Upgrading Your Benzene
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c37.name=Upgrading Your Benzene
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c37.desc=Having moved another tier, you have unlocked another fuel upgrade! Luckily for you, it uses simple inputs, although the place in which you craft it is more expensive than usual. This time around, the bigger expense is by far the processing multiblock, and you will need several stacks of Titanium to put it together. %n%nGiven as much, this is not a task for the very start of EV. It's recommended that you automate your Titanium processing line before you attempt this, because the Chemical Plant is going to grind your manual patience otherwise. If you already have a lot of that, everything else should be much simpler.%n%n(You will need a lot more than a stack. This is just to get you started.)

# Quest: Industrial Coke Oven
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c39.name=Industrial Coke Oven
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c39.desc=Your EV endeavors might push you into a GT++ multiblock, despite most of those being IV-tier. This happens because the special alloys used to put them together need to be crafted in an Alloy Blast Smelter, which is IV, but the Industrial Coke Oven (ICO) does not!%n%nWhat does it do? It's in the name, it's a really fast Coke Oven. So fast, in fact, that it can replace a few dozen Pyrolyse Ovens. It actually takes its recipes from that multi, so you also get the additional fluid, such as Charcoal Byproducts, alongside the greatly increased processing speed. The caveat is that this multi needs both Titanium and Tungsten, although only a small amount of the latter. You can get that much from processing End Stone Dust, Ender Goo or Moon Dust. %n%nYou can also choose between two types of casings. One of them does 12x parallels and the other does 24x parallels, which means the multi can do that amount of recipes at the same time per craft, if it receives enough power to do so. Since they're both quite cheap, you should use the better casings.

# Quest: Mass Distilled Water
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c3a.name=Mass Distilled Water
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c3a.desc=Water is completely free, that much is obvious. Distilled Water, though? It's the same input, but it needs a machine to process it into this version, and you best not choose singleblock Distilleries to do this, because they are incredibly slow and will never keep up with your demands.%n%nThe obvious option is a Distillation Tower. The less obvious option is a Steam Turbine multi, which outputs Distilled Water that is supposedly piped back to where the steam is made. However, there are several steam producers that use regular water, so you can try that? The DT is the simplest and most direct option, though. 3-high is the minimum, so you have to build it like that. It doesn't need a lot of power, it will fill up a tank of any size over time since the water input is completely free.%n%nTo prevent it from running continuously, though, here's a neat trick, in case you haven't done it already: take the output hatch on the second layer, where the Distilled Water comes from, and put it directly above the DT controller. Then, put a Fluid Detector Cover on the bottom side of the hatch and a Machine Controller Cover on the top side of the controller, so that the covers are facing each other. Set the controller cover to "Disable with Redstone", and the DT will stop after the fluid tank you've chosen is full. When it gets full, the output hatch will get stuck with some water, and it will send a redstone signal that stops the DT.

# Quest: Nitric And Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c3b.name=Nitric And Sulfuric Acid
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c3b.desc=Sourcing these two should be easy at this point. Overall, the easiest option for Sulfuric Acid is oil processing, but you can also make it from Sulfur Dust, which is so very common from ore processing.%n%nNitric Acid is a bit more convoluted, but you might have already automated it, since it's needed for Cetane-Boosted Diesel. Ammonia and Oxygen can make it, or Nitrogen Dioxide instead of Ammonia. You won't be able to do it in a single step, but a small line of Chemical Reactor, or their multiblock equivalent, will do it for you.

# Quest: Titanium Chemical Plant
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c3c.name=Titanium Chemical Plant
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c3c.desc=This is the difficult part in the whole process. The multi in which Nitrobenzene is crafted is the Exxonmobil Chemical Plant, also known as the Chemplant, and it is a gigantic 7x7x7 structure with 4 separate upgradable parts to it. Even worse, the outer structure uses multiblock Machine Casings, making the DT look cheap by comparison, and the inside needs a lot of the casings used to craft single blocks.%n%nThe difference between those is that the tier of the outer structure that you need is mentioned in the recipe you want to craft, and the tier of the inner structure is generally related to the EU/t of the recipe, minus one tier. This is because, like the EBF and the LCR, you can use 2 energy hatches, so this HV recipe can be made with MV energy hatches. Since the inner structure's tier decides the max tier of the hatches used in the Chemplant, you can make it out of MV machine casings, which use Aluminium.%n%nThe outer structure will still need many stacks of Titanium, so this is where most of your effort will go. Good luck.

# Quest: Nitrobenzene
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c3d.name=Nitrobenzene
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c3d.desc=With the Chemplant finished, you can slap in the necessary hatches and automate this fuel easily. The Titanium gate really is the main obstacle to this improvement, since you can more than triple the power your Benzene can make with some cheap additions to it!%n%nAs usual, the cost of building the setup will pay off over time. In this case, it'll happen even faster than usual, given how cheap the setup is. Benzene doesn't go anywhere beyond this point, but you can grab this final upgrade and make a lot out of it. Check out the multiblock Gas Turbines, and add a good turbine into them, made of a material like Manyullyn or Shadow Metal.

# Quest: Bet On The Distillus
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c41.name=Bet On The Distillus
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c41.desc=IV brings forth GT++ multis, including an upgrade for the Distillation Tower, called the Dangote Distillus. In structure, it's exactly the same as the DT, but it uses a different controller that has a more complicated recipe. It needs more expensive items, and it's also locked to an IV Chemical Plant, which makes it a very expensive craft if it is the only use you have for that plant. %n%nThat said, it solves the issue of DTs being slow, and those are essentially the backbone of all of these renewable setups. How many quad DTs are you going to need for reliable IV/LuV power, I might ask? Just go for it.

# Quest: Processing Array Automation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c44.name=Processing Array Automation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c44.desc=This one is technically an EV multi, but it's hard to find the amount of Tungstensteel you need for it at that tier. The Processing Array's only purpose is to receive singleblock machines that process materials, like a Macerator, Compressor, and many others. It can use up to 64 of one of those, and does their processing as if they were all running, allowing the inputs and outputs to be moved to one spot, and making a setup more compact and less laggy.%n%nFluid extracting Charcoal into Wood Tar is an example of a step that might want a Processing Array. Even though the recipe time isn't very high (much lower than it used to be), you can make it very fast with just one multi, even when using LV and MV machines to avoid wasteful overclocks. This applies to almost all kinds of processing, with the GT++ multis competing for the same role. Each of those is built differently, and has different requirements, so it's a good idea to check them all to see whether or not a PA is more worthwhile than they are.

# Quest: Large Steel Boiler
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c21.name=Large Steel Boiler
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c21.desc=Direct Charcoal consumption is also improved, if you want to go that way. The second Large Boiler is made out of Steel, but needs HV circuits, which you can make in this tier by using Polyethylene in the circuit boards. It generates steam at a speed equivalent to 1000 EU/t at 100%% fuel efficiency for that steam, which you can't reach with the inefficient Steam Turbines available to you. It also needs two ACOs, but it skips any further processing, at an additional cost of heavy pollution that you'll have to deal with in some way.%n%nThis is the most "spammable" setup you can make. There are no further upgrades to the Large Boilers that accept these cheap fuels (the next boilers only accept some more complicated ones), but you can wallshare these to increase the energy input into your processing. The biggest problem, as usual, is transporting the steam to prevent big energy losses across long stretches of cable. This is not the best option, but it can be used.

# Quest: Biodiesel Alternative
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c1b.name=Biodiesel Alternative
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c1b.desc=Trees are not the only source of power for the renewable enjoyer, though. You can continue to expand your wood production to sustain yourself, but you can also avoid the Charcoal business altogether! There are some naturally-sourced, energetic oils that can be processed into a greener alternative of what oil pumping can lead you to, in this tier. While crude oil turns into Diesel, this oil turns into Biodiesel! %n%nIn general, Biodiesel has less power per bucket than Diesel, which is its main drawback, to compensate for the renewable sources. You could source both of them from plants, but Oilberries are very slow compared to the option you might use, Rape flowers or Goldfish. They are an excellent source of Seed Oil or Fish Oil, but they are also IC2 crops, so their output scales with their stats. %n%nBetween the two, Goldfish have a faster fluid extraction recipe, so they are often recommended for that reason, although it's not a dealbreaker. It's recommended that you get high-statted crops if you want to follow this route, although it is not a necessity, because there are other options that never go into these IC2 crops.%n%nHow many options are there, really? There are many, but they can be divided into 3 categories, and that's what the quest tasks focus on: IC2 crops in a Crop Manager, regular crops in a Multifarm or automatic fishing in a fish trap. All of them are sources of a biological oil, either Seed Oil or Fish Oil, which can then be processed into Biodiesel.

# Quest: The Two Ethanols
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c1c.name=The Two Ethanols
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c1c.desc=The other fluid that mixes in with one of the natural oils to create Biodiesel can be one of two siblings: Methanol and Ethanol. They're very similar, both alcohols composed of carbon atoms surrounded by hydrogen ones, with one OH at the end. They often come from the same source (for example, running Wood Vinegar or Biomass through a Distillation Tower), but they also have some differences. To produce them from simpler elements in a Chemical Reactor, you'll need MV tier, which is where you are at. %n%nCheck NEI for all the recipes you can use for either of these. You only need one, so choose which of the quest tasks you want to complete. The one you're likely going to produce is Methanol.

# Quest: Extracting the Oil
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c1d.name=Extracting the Oil
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c1d.desc=Each option generates a different amount of oil, but this should be the limiting factor in your Biodiesel production regardless of which you choose. This step is always slow, for better or for worse, so your job is add more plants or more fish to the system. You might get byproducts, especially with fish, so deal with them accordingly. %n%nYou can upgrade the setup you have when you get to the next tier, or switch what you're using later. Either way, get some oil.

# Quest: Sodium Hydroxide
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c36.name=Sodium Hydroxide
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c36.desc=The Biodiesel needs a bit of powder magic. In reality, this powder is another chemical that this chain uses, Sodium Hydroxide, NaOH. The bad part is that you can't continue without making this, but there's a boon to this: you only need a little bit of it, around 1 dust to make 45 buckets of Biodiesel. %n%nUnlike in the other steps, you can probably get away with batch crafting this instead of automating it, and still have consistent power from this fuel line. One stack of this dust is enough to make more than 100 million EU's worth of power, as long as the other fluids are automated. Given that, you can forget about it for a long time, but not forever. If you choose to not automate it yet, make sure you check it from time to time.%n%n(This can be automated from Salt Water, which can be automated from Tearstalks, a specific IC2 crop. You get Chlorine and Hydrogen as well.)

# Quest: Biological Diesel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c1e.name=Biological Diesel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c1e.desc=Reacting the three chemicals from the steps before with each other, you get a highly energetic fluid that is, for most purposes, equivalent to Diesel. To burn it for power, you cannot use Steam or Gas Turbines, but instead the Combustion Generators that Diesel also uses. They are reasonably efficient, generating 90%% of the EU shown in NEI per bucket of fuel, although Biodiesel has a lower fuel value than either Benzene or Diesel, but not by much. Besides the generators, you also need a big enough fuel input per tick to sustain your base, so make sure to expand your setup enough to fuel all of your other automations.%n%nBiodiesel isn't the only thing you get from this process, though. As a side product, you also get Glycerol. Do not throw this away, it will prove itself useful when making epoxy resin, and possibly in other setups, to save you some work at a later time. When using singleblock Chemical Reactors, the recipe will stop if the Glycerol output is full, a situation in which a super tank will surely come in handy. %n%nWith that said, HV holds a big upgrade to this fuel that you might want to invest in. Keep progressing to check it out!%n%n 

# Quest: The Most Powerful Biodiesel 
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c23.name=The Most Powerful Biodiesel 
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c23.desc=If you've been working with renewable diesels before, you might want to upgrade them further. Instead of just duplicating your existing setup, you can upgrade Biodiesel to Cetane-Boosted Diesel (CBD), with a specific additive called Tetranitromethane (TNM). You'll get more bang for your buck if you upgrade to this fuel, instead of just making more Biodiesel, since it has 3x more EU per bucket, and the TNM is needed in small quantities. Before you start working on the new setup, though, it's important that you increase the amount of Seed/Fish Oil you're making, and in turn the items that turn into those oils. %n%nAs before, you can use IC2 crops, regular crops/trees or fishing. For IC2 crops, you can use the Multifarm set to IC2 crop mode, which needs HV-gated Uranium Electrum Tubes but automated more than 1000 crops while being very conservative with power and fertilizer, or the HV Crop Manager. For normal crops/trees, use the EnderIO Farming Station, also unlocked in HV. For fishing, you don't have new tools, you can only add more Fish Catchers or use Goldfish IC2 crops if you're oriented that way.%n%nTo complete this quest, make a Multifarm, a Farming Station or some Fish Catchers.

# Quest: Green Nitric Acid
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c2e.name=Green Nitric Acid
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c2e.desc=One half of TNM is Nitric Acid, which has more paths to reach it than can be listed here. It's basically Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Oxygen merged together, and many compounds made from these things can lead you to Nitric Acid. How you get this is up to you, but it might be a lot easier if you already automated some Distillation Tower setups for other renewable resources.%n%nLet me explain. Nitric Acid can be made directly from Ammonia and Oxygen. O2 has many sources, and you should have already automated it, but Ammonia is harder to get: you either make it from Nitrogen Oxide and Dioxide, or you skip all that with a Fermented Biomass DT, which outputs Ammonia directly. That is the fastest way, if you already made that setup, otherwise you'll need to chain several reactions together.

# Quest: Green Ethenone
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c2f.name=Green Ethenone
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c2f.desc=The other half of TNM is Ethenone. Once again, DTs can make this easier for you, but Ethenone is pretty simple to figure out: either Acetic Acid or Acetone can make it, both of which are DT outputs, but Acetic Acid also needs Sulfuric Acid to make it. %n%nAcetone is easier, but either way works. One important thing to understand is that you only need a small, tiny amount of Ethenone when compared to other chemicals. When working with Biodiesel, 200L of Ethenone are enough for 9000L of CBD, which is equal to 9 million EU at 100%% fuel efficiency. With that consideration, each bucket of Ethenone corresponds to 45M EU! Quite powerful, if I do say so myself. %n%nClearly, your bottleneck will be the Biodiesel and, in turn, the Seed/Fish Oil.

# Quest: Green Cetane-Boosted Diesel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c30.name=Green Cetane-Boosted Diesel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c30.desc=Tetranitromethane is the additive you need to turn Biodiesel into Cetane-Boosted Diesel. Each bucket of the first turns into 0.9 buckets of the second, but if you look at the EU values per bucket of both, 320k turns into 900k EU, discounting 5.7k EU from the craft, a huge upgrade in power generation. The TNM only costs some thousand EU, the main difficulty is automating the input of all the materials, which shouldn't be too hard at this stage of progression. %n%nThe power density of this fuel is great, but it doesn't mean you'll have enough power to get to EV. What really matters here is the amount of plants or fish you can provide, since all the other items and fluids are basically additives when compared to the amount of oil you need. It's hard to match the speed at which crude oil can be obtained, but you can bring forth a lot of Seed/Fish Oil if you increase the size of those setups.%n%nThere are more possibilities for CBD in the future, if you want to move towards those.

# Quest: CBD Into Steam
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c38.name=CBD Into Steam
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c38.desc=There are no more Diesel-related upgrades for the CBD. To continue using Combustion Generators, or the LCE, you can only make your setup bigger or upgrade energy hatches. There is, however, a more power-dense fuel that uses CBD in its recipe, but there's a catch: it's a solid fuel, to be used in steam boilers, which gives it advantages and disadvantages.%n%nEverything from this quest onwards is about those solid fuels. There are two versions, one with additional inputs over the other, and they both follow the same logic: they need to be converted to Steam, which is hard to transport, convert into EU and basically require the EV and IV Large Steam Boilers. However, the combination of these fuels and those boilers is much, much more fuel efficient than before, if you are willing to face the additional challenges in this kind of setup.%n%nHow does it generally go? If you already have CBD, you can get power from it by putting it directly in Combustion Generators. In this line, though, you need to automate Fuel Binder, add blocks of Charcoal, Coal or Coal Coke and then put the Super Fuel in a Titanium or Tungstensteel Large Boiler, where you get Superheated Steam. After that, you need a HP Steam Turbine multi, followed by a regular Steam Turbine multi, and the setup is complete. %n%nIf you want to continue, then you'll need at least one Titanium Large Boiler. Build one. 

# Quest: Coal Or Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c3e.name=Coal Or Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c3e.desc=The Super Fuels are blocks of burnable material, like Coal Blocks, which they need in their crafting recipe. It doesn't have to be Coal, though: you can do Coal, Charcoal or Coal Coke, and all of them make the same amount of Super Fuel. However, the amount of fluid fuel used changes based on which kind of block you used, which poses a problem.%n%n(We will ignore Lignite Coal, since it is by far the worst option. If you want to use it, dealing with the efficiency problem is up to you.)%n%nThe problem is this: the amount of EU you save by choosing Charcoal instead of the other two is less than the amount of EU that the additional fuel can make. Basically, the most efficient option is Coal Coke, then Coal, then Charcoal. The easiest option to automate is certainly Charcoal, which means this is a choice between ease of automation and fuel efficiency. Even if you use Charcoal, you will still get more EU from the final fuel than what you used as input.%n%nCoal can be automated too, though! There are many ways to do this, but the most popular way of automating items that aren't renewable by default is usually by using either IC2 crops or Forestry bees, both of which have their own renewable Coal. If you never made progress in either of those, keep in mind that they need time and effort to give you good results, but if you have, then they are great options to make this fuel even more efficiently. Naturally, you will then turn it into Coal Coke with Pyrolyse Ovens, ACOs or ICOs.%n%nStock up on either Charcoal or Coal Coke blocks to continue.

# Quest: Normal Or Magic
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c3f.name=Normal Or Magic
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c3f.desc=There are two different Super Fuels, not just one. The regular Solid Super Fuel (SSF) has a heat value of 100k, whereas the Magic Solid Super Fuel (MSSF) has it as 150k, or 50%% more EU per block. As you can guess, the second one is more valuable, and worth it to make, but it requires even more processing than the first one.%n%nThe good part is, you don't really need lots of Thaumcraft progression. You barely need any, if at all, because there are many ways to make the Magic Fuel Binder and the block itself, including some that don't use any Thaumcraft items. There are so many options that this quest won't ask for a specific one, and it is once again up to you to decide which to choose, if you choose the magic fuel at all. As a tip, Alumentum is not mineable like Diamonds, but it can be automated by throwing Charcoal Dust at a Cauldron, and it has a higher burn value than the inputs. Additionally, for Coal Coke, only the Alumentum option is available.%n%nBasically, the SSF has 3 steps: craft the binder, craft the solid block and craft the fluid. The MSSF has more steps: craft the binder, upgrade it to magic binder, craft the solid block, craft the fluid and then finish with the extra items. Choose your own path.

# Quest: Super Fuel And Boiling
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c40.name=Super Fuel And Boiling
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c40.desc=If you've gotten this far, you should be about ready to produce Steam at an alarming rate from this hyper-efficient fuel. Unlike the Combustion Generators and Gas Turbines, though, you need more multis in front of your Large Boiler. Since it outputs Superheated Steam, you will need two turbines: the first one outputs EU and regular Steam, and the second one takes it in and outputs more EU and water, to be reused in the boiler.%n%nThe multis don't do anything by themselves, they need a turbine inside the controller to run them, and the turbine's size and material decide what their preferred flow rate is, and the EU/t at that rate. Good materials in EV are Shadow Metal (from Thaumcraft) and Manuyllyn, in IV you can use Oriharukon. Steam Turbine multis usually have a lower EU/t value than Gas Turbine ones, which means that you might have to make more of each kind of multi. This depends on the amount of boilers you are using, which tier of boiler and also whether or not you are using loose mode (check the Steam Turbine quest for more details).%n%nFlow rates when using Steam are very high, as you can imagine. You will need huge GT pipes if you use that mode of transportation, but there is a better way: AE2 P2P tunnels, set to fluid mode, can teleport fluids from one multi to the next without caring for high flow rates. With all that taken care of, all you need is an EV Buffered Dynamo Hatch for each turbine, and your setup is complete!

# Quest: More Steam For Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c42.name=More Steam For Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c42.desc=The last of the Large Boilers is IV-tier, and it's the Tungstensteel version. In numbers, it beats all of the other boilers, both in EU/t and fuel efficiency, so it's a good idea to build one or more of these if you've been working on the Super Fuels. Each one will output Superheated Steam matching an EU output of 16000 EU/t, at 100%% fuel efficiency, or 24000 EU/t with 150%%. %n%nAlongside this, you should also work on automating the Magic Super Fuel, if you haven't already. It needs more inputs, but it's even more bang for your buck, the entire point of this fuel line! You will need automated Blazes and Endermen, preferably, unless you can automate the Thaumcraft version of the Magic Fuel Binder recipe. For the fuel itself, Alumentum can be done simply with Charcoal Dust in a Cauldron or Thaumatorium.%n%nThe dark blue towers might ask for a lot of Large Turbines to process all of the Steam, especially if you build a quad boiler setup. You can expect almost 11000 L/t of it as output, per boiler, so look at some of the turbines you can craft and check out how many you need. The quest after this one gives some suggestions for battling the potential turbine spam.

# Quest: Huge Turbines And Loose Mode
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c43.name=Huge Turbines And Loose Mode
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c43.desc=If you are invested in making good IV power from Super Fuel, you will need a lot of Turbine multis. Their EU/t at optimal flow is much too low for you to survive with only one or two. However, there are several things you should consider in regards to these turbines, and the fuel you're using.%n%nIn summary, this fuel is very, very efficient. Turbines can be made faster by losing some efficiency. You have more than enough fuel efficiency to spare!%n%nLet's review this in more detail. Turbines produce EU based on the flow rate of the fuel that they are consuming. Their optimal flow represents the highest fuel efficiency they can reach (140%% or 150%% for the good turbines in these tiers), but you can increase the flow beyond that point and still get a higher EU/t value. However, the fuel becomes less efficient. A good tradeoff, if you need it.%n%nSteam loses efficiency quickly if you do this, though. The right way to pull this off with Steam Turbines is to switch to Loose mode, a mode unique to them, which makes the optimal flow shoot way up at a considerable loss to fuel efficiency. The jump in EU/t is so high, however, that you can replace a whole squadron of turbines with just one or two, as you can see if you look at the turbine items' tooltips.%n%nEach setup has their own details, so you will have to work things out and make personal decisions about how you will manage the turbines. Just make sure to not let the EU/t value go beyond the maximum that the dynamo hatch can output, or you will have problems!


## Quest Line: Powerful Nuclear Physics
betterquesting.questline.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000001a.name=Powerful Nuclear Physics
betterquesting.questline.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000001a.desc=A series of questlines dedicated to nuclear fission and fusion, both for power and useful items.

# Quest: Basis for All Reactors
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c49.name=Basis for All Reactors
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c49.desc=Nuclear energy is first available in EV. However, it comes in all shapes and forms, and it can be hard to choose one kind of setup to use amongst all of those that are available. To start this questbook page, this first quest will be a summary of how nuclear power can be produced, and when it is available. Other quests down the line will have more details about each specific setup, but this is an overview of all of them.%n%nTL;DR: Nuke < Fluid Nuke < Vacuum Nuke < LFTR = THTR = Naq Reactor < Fusion < Compact Fusion for power, per reactor. For breeding, Nuke < LFTR = Naq Reactor < HTGR in terms of breeding speed and outputs, with fusion being required to make some materials.%n%nThe first nuclear source you have access to is the Industrialcraft 2 Nuclear Reactor, usually called a nuke. It's a small singleblock that can have additional chambers attached to it to make a multiblock structure, and the amount of chambers decides the amount of space available for the nuke's components. Inside it, fuel rods with radioactive materials generate power, and every other item serves to control the temperature of the reactor and keep it from exploding. It generates EU directly, but it can be upgraded to a fluid nuke, which outputs hot coolant instead, for the Large Heat Exchanger, but with more efficiency. Lastly, there's also the vacuum nuke, which is very similar to regular nukes but it cools down by using Coolant Cells, which wear out and are only reusable by using Vacuum Freezers. Usual fuels for all of these are Thorium, in EV, and Uranium, in IV.%n%nBetween IV and LuV, there's another kind of reactor, the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR). In this large multi, the Thorium and Uranium are mixed with very hot, molten salts (which need to be prepared in another multi), improving the power generation at the cost of additional processing. It's an expensive setup, but the depleted fuel can be recycled into many more byproducts than usual, especially at LuV, where you can get almost all the noble gases amongst other things, alongside huge amounts of power.%n%nAt those same tiers (albeit mostly for LuV and above), there are also two larger multis, the Thorium High Temperature Reactor (THTR) and the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR). The THTR is mostly for power, needing an input of about 0.5 IV amps and outputting LuV power at a varied amount of amps, whereas the HTGR is a breeder reactor, outputting 1/20 the amount of hot coolant, which is where the power generation comes from, but with much better ratios for breeding into Lutetium and other elements.%n%nAnother kind of nuclear reactor is the Good Generators Naquadah Reactor, which coincidentally has recipes to consume Thorium Liquid Fuel and Uranium Liquid Fuel, alongside the several types of Naquadah fuel that exist. With these two, this reactor can process those elements much faster than regular nukes, which is helpful for power and for breeding, but it requires more processing until those fuels are ready to be consumed. Additionally, there are fuel rods for the IC2 nukes that use different Thorium and Uranium fuels, more or less related to these. %n%nFrom then on, it's fusion power. The infamous GregTech Fusion Reactors work by fusing two elements into a new one, which is often a required step for progression, but they also turn the power they require into exponentially more in the way of plasma. Helium and Tin Plasma are some of the most used for power, and putting them into Plasma Turbines is an excellent source of power for lategame, in ZPM to UEV and so on. There are 4 tiers to the regular Fusion Reactors, but there is also compact fusion and some other kinks to fusion that you might explore later on.%n%nThis page will mostly serve to guide you into making a choice between all of these possibilities. It's pretty much guaranteed that you'll use at least 2-3 of these setups, so try to get comfortable with these quest descriptions.

# Quest: Build the Assembly Line First
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c4d.name=Build the Assembly Line First
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c4d.desc=This branch refers to nuclear fusion. This content is strictly LuV onwards, so you will need the Assembly Line before even starting to think about fusion. It is the most "endgame" content on this quest page, so it's the one left for last.%n%nThe quest you need to complete is in the "Multiblock Goals" tab. There are also fusion-related quests in the LuV, ZPM and UV tabs, amongst others, so check them out when you're there.

# Quest: The Path of Fusion
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c50.name=The Path of Fusion
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c50.desc=The most advanced nuclear technology there is to use in the pack is nuclear fusion. This is an event where two atoms collide with each other and fuse into a different atom while simultaneously generating energy from the plasma, when it is processed. It's impossible to perform in a reactor in real life, because the temperature requirements are too high to maintain any kind of reactor solid with decent efficiency. In GTNH, though, we have better materials.%n%nThe first Fusion Reactor can be built in late LuV, and each tier unlocks some material that is important to progress into the later tiers. Fusion crafting becomes important at that stage, for materials such as Europium, Americium, Neutronium and Oganesson, so you will want to dedicate reactors to specific things later on. More importantly, these materials come out as plasma, which needs to be cooled down to be turned into ingots and plates. On top of that, though, this cooling process is where you can get lots of power!%n%nThe usual process of power generation here is to pump EU into the Fusion Reactor. It needs enough energy to start the reaction, which will then proceed quickly and output good amounts of plasma. This plasma goes into Plasma Turbines, which output huge amounts of EU/t and the cooled down material, ready to be used in further crafting. A beginner's setup can output 640,000 EU/t from one reactor before overclocking, and this grows quickly over time. Fusion power dominates the game for several tiers due to its simplicity, receding away from the powergen setups that were getting more and more complicated with each tier. Two materials fuse into one, plasma comes out, goes into turbine and boom, lots of energy! It's like a steam tier powergen but with big numbers.%n%nTo summarize, fusion is required for progression because of the materials it produces. At the same time, it's very powerful as a source of EU.

# Quest: Thorium as Early Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c4f.name=Thorium as Early Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c4f.desc=The very first step into nuclear power is done with Thorium in an Industrialcraft2 nuke. This multiblock already has a good amount of information in the questbook, split between the EV and How to Generate Power pages, so you should look at those if you want even more information that might not be written here. For the sake of not repeating everything, this will be more of a summary.%n%nThorium nukes are better for creating other elements, specifically Lutetium, than for power. The best setup needs the maximum amount of chambers, 6, and a lot of components inside the reactor to burn 10 quad Thorium rods and generate 1920 EU/t, close to one EV amp. If you made 4 of these, you would get close to an IV amp, but this becomes very costly between the total 36 chambers and the recursive crafting of the components inside. The good news is that Thorium is a very cheap fuel, easily mined in the Nether, and recyclable in large amounts from depleted fuel rods.%n%nThis setup, and many others, can be found in the GTNH wiki in the "Nuclear Reactors" page. However, to display it here as best I can, this is the 1920 EU/t Thorium reactor:%n%nOPVOVOPPO%nEOOEOEOOE%nORRORORRO%nORRORORRO%nEOOEOEOOE%nOPPOVOVPO%n%nE -> Component Heat Exchanger (8 needed)%nV -> Component Heat Vent (4 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (26 needed)%nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Thorium (10 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (6 needed)%n%nYou can make this setup, if you wish, but the only required task to continue to the next quest are 10 single Thorium rods. 

# Quest: Improved Fission
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c4e.name=Improved Fission
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c4e.desc=This branch starts at mid-IV. In this direction, you will find several setups that are related to nuclear fission, the same process that the IC2 nukes do, but in more complex and rewarding ways. Through here, you can get power and breeding byproducts as you would with nukes, but faster and with more variety of options and goals. %n%nThat's right. If you've used IC2 nukes, you might have learned more or less how they work, but the whole system feels a bit dated. That's no surprise, considering that this is base IC2 content and from 10 years ago or more. Whatever additions GTNH gave to those setups, they were minimal in comparison to the general implementation of those nukes. In fact, some of the new content for those was a result of new nuclear fission content that was sort of backported into nukes. %n%nWe have good progression standards here, though. Once you've reached IV, LuV and so on, you will be able to use more advanced ways to work with Thorium and Uranium! These fuels are almost always the focus of the whole thing, with Plutonium coming in from time to time, but each new reactor will demand them to be supplied in a different way for things to work properly. The reactors featured here are the LFTR, the THTR/HTGR and the Naq-related reactors.%n%nFinally, this questline features many different multis and setups that are often unrelated to each other. Instead of forcing you to build a full LFTR setup before getting access to the THTR, for example, these quests will have simple required tasks, and simple rewards. The optional tasks will have the main expensive crafting, to guide you in building these setups if you're interested in them.

# Quest: Building the Reactor
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c51.name=Building the Reactor
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c51.desc=All the regular Fusion Reactors share the same structure. The tier they belong to is determined by the materials used, which become more expensive for each tier. Tier 1 is LuV, tier 2 is ZPM, tier 3 is UV and there's also a tier 4. The structure looks like a huge ring, which barely fits in one chunk, with the controller on the inside of the ring, not the outside.%n%nTo help you with placing all the blocks in the right places, the controller's interface shows a diagram of which blocks go where. To get a 3D view of the placements in the world, use the Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector on the controller. If you need even more assistance, there are lots of resources on the internet that explain how it's build, since this is a big GregTech multiblock that is required in many packs, and almost always built the same way.%n%nThe original quests for each reactor tier will be included in the questline, since they provide good information about each tier and are updated.

# Quest: Fusion Europium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5a.name=Fusion Europium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5a.desc=There are chemical elements that are very important as building materials for high-tier machines. Unfortunately, some of these elements are very hard to find naturally, if at all, and need to be created by hand. They're not alloys, not a mix of materials, but they can be a mix of atoms...%n%nEuropium is the first wall that can be solved by fusion, and usually only by fusion. It is possible to find it in ores, but it's much simpler to build a Fusion Reactor and produce it yourself, because you will need it in large quantities for your progression. It is a slow craft, but not an expensive one provided you already have the reactor built, since it uses cheap materials as inputs: Hydrogen and Neodymium. Both of these were used extensively for progression, so you should not have any trouble grabbing several hundreds of each to start this reaction.%n%nIt is important that you gather a lot of inputs. Each time the Fusion Reactor changes recipe, it has a start-up period where it needs a large amount of energy to begin crafting. In the case of Europium, you'll need 150 million EU to start crafting it, and then 7,077,888 EU per ingot of Europium crafted. This does not come out as plasma, so you can't get energy back from it! Additionally, each ingot takes 14.4 seconds to craft, so you can come out with a few stacks of Europium relatively quickly. During this time, you cannot produce plasma for power, so it's a good idea to have a good amount of EU stored, or other powergen setups working in the background, while you craft this material.%n%nWith Europium, you can craft a new kind of boule, wafers and many other things! Check NEI to see what you have unlocked.

# Quest: Optional Tier 1 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5c.name=Optional Tier 1 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5c.desc=Osmium - from Helium and Tungsten. Osmium from the platline is quite power-hungry, which this recipe won't solve, but it will at least help you past the terrible output rate of Osmium. You can get it faster from here as long as you can keep supplying Tungsten and power.%n%nSunnarium - from Helium + Glowstone. If you've had difficulty in getting lots of Sunnarium after the Molecular Transformer nerf, you can try this for your Solar Panels and other things. Glowing Coral processing with UUM is recommended, though.%n%nBoron - from Lithium and Helium. If you haven't automated this yet, for Borosilicate Glass for example, this is one way to do it. You will need lots of glass for the Mega Blast Furnace and other big multis of the kind, so it's not a useless recipe.

# Quest: Fusing Americium and Tritanium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c75.name=Fusing Americium and Tritanium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c75.desc=A t2 Fusion Reactor unlocks more fusion materials, some of which will again be necessary to progress into the next tiers. One of them is Americium, which is the reason for all the Lutetium worry until now: both are required, because one makes the other. The recipe also needs Chrome as input, but that should be much easier to get than Lutetium or the power needed per bucket of Molten Americium, which is almost 300M EU. %n%nYou will need many stacks of this material for your future progression, but your first goal should be to make 141 ingots (check the ZPM "Making Americium" quest for details). However, if you have extra Lutetium, you should make more Americium, you will not regret doing this when you need more of it later.%n%nAnother useful material you unlock at t2 is Tritanium, which is different from Trinium. The source of this material is fusion, and the inputs to make it are Duranium and Titanium. If you haven't made Duranium before, you'll see that it needs a lot of Radon, almost 8x the amount of Tritanium you end up with. For this, you should already have the Radon loop automated, that step is very important for this.%n%nYou will need Tritanium to progress, just as you need Americium, so it's a good idea to batch craft both of these in your new t2 Fusion Reactor so you don't have to go back to these recipes soon.

# Quest: Optional Tier 2 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c77.name=Optional Tier 2 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c77.desc=Uranium - from Gold + Aluminium or Magnesium + Mercury. You should have already left nuclear fission behind, but if you ever need Uranium, you can use this? You should have a lot of it already.%n%nPlutonium - from Helium + Uranium. A quick 1:1 conversion from U238 to P239, but you already have access to Plutonium Ore, so this is probably pointless.%n%nCalifornium - from Beryllium + Plutonium. Mostly used for Oganesson, not very useful for anything else, and you won't need a lot of this if replicating Oganesson is an option.%n%n(These 3 recipes makes a possible chain to Oganesson, which can be made in t3 fusion. Not that they are necessarily the best option to get it.)%n%nExcited Uranium Fuel - from Hydrogen and Uranium Liquid Fuel. This is for the Naquadah Generator, which is late ZPM, or possibly to use in IC2 nukes, although that's the worse option. Basically, it's accelerated nuclear fission, if you have interest in that.%n%nExcited Plutonium Fuel - from Hydrogen and Plutonium Liquid Fuel. Same as above, but from Plutonium. This means it's more expensive, but also more powerful, and can yield a lot of power in the Naquadah Generator with the right additives.

# Quest: Bismuth Plasma For Soldering
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c76.name=Bismuth Plasma For Soldering
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c76.desc=Who in their right mind would use a plasma to solder things together? That's mental. Well, this entire progression at this point is mental, that's all there is to it.%n%nIt's not directly with the plasma, though. It is once again about the Mutated Living Solder, and now its fluid inputs: Tin Plasma and Bismuth Plasma. These are the two main components of the previous solders, and that's the reason they're there. Tin Plasma is t2 fusion, and you might have already made a lot of it to generate power, but Bismuth Plasma is t3, with the inputs being Zinc Plasma and Molten Tantalum, which is actually Tritium, Copper and Tantalum in the end. %n%nThe recipes are cheap in power, you just have to make sure the inputs are there. Tritium can be centrifuged from Deuterium, which itself can be centrifuged from Hydrogen Gas, and the other two inputs are easy. You will need 18000L of each plasma for 40000L of the solder, or almost half the amount for each.

# Quest: Optional Tier 3 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c79.name=Optional Tier 3 Fusion
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c79.desc=Indium - from Lithium + Silver. This is one of the most important optional fusion recipes, given how difficult Indium is to get. Your options are to either replicate it, make it with fusion, obtain it from the naquadria line, or obtain it from processing sphalerite ore.%n%n(You can make Indium in other ways, of course, but this is a relatively popular, non-forced fusion recipe)%n%nOganesson - from Calcium + Californium. This is the best noble gas of them all, and a very power-hungry recipe compared to most. However, Oganesson will save you power on EBF recipes, reducing recipe time more than any other fluid, and it also boosts Void Miners to their maximum speed. Replicating it, if possible, is easier than producing more through fusion.%n%nAmericium - from Hydrogen + Plutonium 241. This is the cheaper Americium recipe that was promised to you in t2, and it no longer needs Lutetium. You should be able to get both of the inputs very easily, so enjoy your cheaper Americium!%n%nNeutronium - from Naquadria + Americium. Neutronium fusion? You probably won't need to use this, but it is a source other than ores that you can try.

# Quest: The End of Fusion Materials
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c84.name=The End of Fusion Materials
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c84.desc=There are only so many required fusion materials, which you've already gone through at this point. There are many more recipes, many of which have been listed in the quests so far, but also some that are yet to be tackled.%n%nThis, however, is the endgame. If you look at NEI, there are some recipes with EU/T and start EU values that are higher than what t3 fusion can offer, which suggests that there is yet another tier. The reality is that t4 fusion does exist, but it's more for bragging rights than real usefulness, alongside being much more expensive and harder to make than any of the other reactors. There is a quest for this in the "Endgame Goals" page, should you have unlocked that.%n%nAmong the last materials, you will find Flerovium, Rhugnor and, finally, Hypogen. They don't have a lot of possible uses for most of the pack, but Hypogen becomes essential in the endgame, where it becomes part of the coil block progression, as well as being used in some recipes as wires. If you truly want to walk towards the stargate, you will need to craft many stacks of this.

# Quest: How Much Power From One Reactor?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5b.name=How Much Power From One Reactor?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5b.desc=A completed Fusion Reactor does not generate any EU on its own, it only consumes it. That said, it's very simple to generate power from plasma, a one-step process of having a Plasma Turbine. These special turbines only work with plasma and are significantly more expensive than the previous ones, requiring Tungstensteel for the body and Naquadah + Naquadah Alloy for the controller.%n%nFirst, how much plasma can one tier 1 reactor produce? The best option for power at this stage is Helium Plasma, with its cheap inputs, and this takes 6.4 seconds per bucket to generate. Since a bucket is worth 81,920,000 EU, that equates to 640,000 EU/t at 100%% efficiency or 960,000 EU/t at 150%%. That is almost 8 ZPM amps, a massive power spike compared to the powergen available before this, with almost no processing before the plasma! For most players, fusion is the only source of power for 3 or 4 tiers, and all other ways of getting power are much more complicated and harder to upscale.%n%nThat said, you will still need multiple turbines to actually consume all of the plasma. At LuV, each turbine can only output the equivalent of 1 ZPM amp, so you will need high-efficiency turbines that don't go above the value of 131,072 EU/t output. Three candidates, in descending order of efficiency, are: Large Rhodium-Palladium at 150%% and 124,740 EU/t, Normal Draconium at 145%% and 121,800 EU/t and Large Tungstencarbide at 140%% and 123,480 EU/t.

# Quest: Reactors are Expensive!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c85.name=Reactors are Expensive!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c85.desc=Your first t1 Fusion Reactor is one of the biggest walls to overcome throughout this pack's progression. It's very unlikely you can afford to just build another one right after, so you will have to manage several reactions with that single one.%n%nThe new fusion condition is that you will have to pay a cost of EU and time every time you switch the recipe that's being crafted. Assuming you're using fusion power, the production of Europium and any other material should be batched between your usual rows of power generation. Perhaps you're overproducing power? In that case, you can use the pause to fuse some useful materials.%n%nIn time, you will be able to afford and use multiple fusion reactors. For not, this isn't the case.

# Quest: UV Power Per Turbine
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5d.name=UV Power Per Turbine
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5d.desc=Once you progress enough in ZPM to make ZPM Dynamo Hatches, you can increase each turbine's output to 524,288 EU/t. At this number, you'll be a lot less limited by the turbine material, and it's possible to increase the total power output of one Fusion Reactor considerably. You can cover the total Helium Plasma output from one reactor with 3 Plasma Turbines, if you choose the right materials:%n%nLarge High Durability Compound Steel 230%% 202,860 EU/t%nLarge Atomic Separation Catalyst 200%% 399,672 EU/t%nLarge Adamantium 180%% 170,010 EU/t%nLarge Draconium 170%% 214,200 EU/t (durable)%nLarge Ichorium 170%% 342,720 EU/t (very durable)%nLarge Neutronium 160%% 241,920 EU/t (very durable)%n%nThe power output and final efficiency can vary a lot, based on which turbines you're using. Some of them, like Ichorium and Neutronium, last basically forever, while others will need to be replaced from time to time but offer higher efficiency. If you want to get more power per turbine, to reach closer to the dynamo's limit, you can increase the flow of plasma to the turbine, but be careful! You can't go beyond the dynamo's limit, and you will also lose efficiency as you increase the flow amount. More concrete values for efficiency loss can be found in the Plasma Turbine quest in the LuV page.%n%nMake a normal or buffered ZPM dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest: Establishment of Fusion

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c86.desc=Fusion is the lategame. It is not the entire lategame, but several tiers are effectively relying on it, even if new ways of generating power are being discovered (developed) over time. Whether you got here through focusing on power or products, you have surely felt the importance of that donut on your base, have you not?%n%nLet's just hope your power storage doesn't run out when you start relying on Mega Blast Furnace processing.%n%n

# Quest: Tin Plasma From T2
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c72.name=Tin Plasma From T2
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c72.desc=Once you upgrade your Fusion Reactor to tier 2, you gain access to a better recipe for power generation, which is Tin Plasma. Helium-3 is used, as it was before, but now with Silver, which you can automate in a million ways. The processing speed is slightly higher than before, but the fuel value of this plasma is much higher than what you were using before, at 304,496,000 EU per bucket. This impressive fuel value means that the max power output of a single t2 reactor at 100%% fuel efficiency is 2,740,464 EU/t, and with the turbines you can use here, you can twice as much as that or even more!%n%nTo utilize all of the plasma, you will be using 10 or more turbines with good rotors. Before doing that, though, it's a good idea to step back and test your turbines with this plasma, preferably in Creative mode, because the fuel value is so high that one liter of plasma is worth 304,496 EU at 100%% efficiency. If you set the input rate to anything higher than 1 L/t, you will go above the ZPM Dynamo limit, and even 1 L/t will be too high if the turbine's efficiency is 175%% or above! Until you upgrade your hatches, you might once again be stuck will less power output or efficiency than you'd like. There's only one way to fix that.

# Quest: Duranium and the Cyclotron
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c83.name=Duranium and the Cyclotron
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c83.desc=In the previous quest, Duranium was introduced as a material used to make Tritanium. While it becomes required for this reason, there is more to it than that. Another recipe that uses it is a Cyclotron recipe, which has a chance to produce a Quantum Anomaly. %n%nFirst off, what is the Cyclotron? That is a multiblock that works a bit like fusion, but only for the purpose of making new materials. It collides single particles with one another, or against fluids, to generate new items while consuming power. Most of the recipes it has won't be very useful, if at all, but it can also make Quantum Anomalies. This is a chance craft, but the Anomaly has a special property: when used to convert some blocks to others, it will not be consumed. Therefore, for that purpose, you only need to get one.%n%nIs this required? Well, yes. When you arrive at a certain stage of the game, you might find yourself needing a new kind of soldering alloy, called Mutated Living Solder. To craft this, you need a Chemical Plant made with Botmium, which is an alloy that required Advanced Nitinol. This, in turn, is one of the blocks that need a Quantum Anomaly for its conversion. Given that Duranium is the only fluid choice to make the Anomaly, then it becomes required for this as well, but only a couple tiers from ZPM.%n%nAdditionally, there are other recipes, like the Elemental Duplicator. This is a very powerful replicator that will give you a great boost in automation due to its speed and the replication recipes it can do, but the Quantum Anomaly used in this recipe will be consumed, so watch out: if you only have one, don't use it for this.

# Quest: Two Million Turbines
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c73.name=Two Million Turbines
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c73.desc=Hopefully, not more than a handful. The objective here is for each of them to output close to 2 million EU/t.%n%nHow can you get there? Look at the UV Dynamo Hatch's recipe and you have your new objective. When you arrive there, each turbine that is equipped with that impressive block will be able to output up to 2,097,152 EU/t, which again opens you up to new turbine opportunities. Some good choices at this point are as follows:%n%nLarge Cosmic Neutronium 220%% 1,330,560 EU/t%nLarge Awakened Draconium 190%% 478,800 EU/t%nLarge Trinium 180%% 1,452,520 EU/t%n%nAt this point, you might consider building more t1 Fusion Reactors to process other materials. Even if you stop the reactor you're using to generate this plasma, the EU cost of restarting it is less than 1 bucket of plasma, so it's probably not that big of a deal.%n%nMake a normal or buffered UV dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest: The Overclocking of the Ages
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c74.name=The Overclocking of the Ages
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c74.desc=Tin Plasma is more power-dense, but it's not a required upgrade. As you scale up, it's always worth it to look back at Helium Plasma for how renewable it is, something that Tin Plasma has unfortunately lost a bit of. It can be made renewable, but one of its strengths was in the Molecular Transformer recipe that transformed Tin, the output, into Silver, one of the inputs. This recipe is now in the new Molecular Transformer Multiblock and does not scale as well as before. Therefore it might be easier to use void miners for silver or to stick with Helium Plasma.%n%nAs per usual, running a lower tier recipe awards you with an overclock. Unlike other GT machines, though, the Fusion Reactor's overclock doubles both speed and energy consumption, which maintains the energy consumption per recipe but gives only half of a speed boost that a perfect overclock (like the Large Chemical Reactor) would. This means that a t2 reactor can produce exactly twice as much power as a t1 in the form of plasma output, but the upgrade is bigger than that when taking better turbines into account.%n%nWhat comes next, then? Tier 3 is what is next. There is no new fuel to be used here, your options are either 4x speed on Helium or 2x speed on Tin. After getting the cheaper Americium recipe that's available on t3, you will be able to make more reactors at a cheaper cost, but this lack of fuel upgrade will still be problematic in your progression. You will have to find other ways to upgrade your power, which will be revealed after this.

# Quest: Infinite Turbines
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c78.name=Infinite Turbines
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c78.desc=Some turbine materials are not available for you, either because you don't have the material itself or because the Dynamo Hatch in the turbine cannot handle the power output from plasma. It will be a different story in UHV, when you can once again quadruple the max output of each turbine, and also unlock Infinity as an option for turbines.%n%nLarge Infinity 270%% 4,354,560 EU/t%nLarge Infinity Catalyst 200%% 806,400 EU/t%n%nYes, that's basically it. You can use any material from the previous turbine quests, but when you make the t8 rocket and can mine Infinity Catalyst, these are the two options. Obviously, Infinity is much better, but also much more expensive. If you stick with fusion, you will need several of those to push through the endgame. Remember that you can input plasma beyond the optimal flow, and get more out of each turbine at the cost of fuel efficiency.%n%nMake a normal or buffered UHV dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest: Smaller Fusion Is Bigger
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c7a.name=Smaller Fusion Is Bigger
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c7a.desc=It's not smaller, it's compact!%n%nCompact Fusion. If you've been looking for a big multiblock to put together, you have arrived at a very neat thing. There's hardly anything that could beat its size, except for a max height Mega Distillation Tower, but this is instead a wide multi instead of a tall one. It is so wide, in fact, that it cannot fit in one chunk, and instead covers a 3x3 chunk space! Make sure you follow the instructions and the hologram properly, and jump in joy when you have one of these built.%n%nYou can choose one of four tiers for this reactor, in the same way as the normal Fusion Reactors. The Compact controller will need 48 of the regular controllers in the same tier, plus some other materials, and more than 2 thousand blocks in the structure, which are conveniently detailed in the tooltip. It is much bigger than the previous reactors, but it also has a huge number of parallels, starting at 64x with t1 and ending at a maximum of 256x with t4! %n%nThis is the go-to when you have found yourself deep into t3 fusion, perhaps even t4, and you find yourself running short on power. Instead of making a tower of reactors, why not make one of these? The only power issue that you'll have after getting it done is the amount of turbines you will need to eat up all the plasma.

# Quest: A Second Reactor?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c87.name=A Second Reactor?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c87.desc=At this point, why not? You should be a in a better position to afford it, but there is the issue that t3 fusion unlocks an easier Americium recipe, which lets you craft a second t3 more easily. You might not want to wait that long, maybe you've been smelting a lot of ingots, or using World Accelerators?%n%nRegardless, two Helium Plasma reactors will surely suffice for whatever it is you're doing. Tin Plasma is worth using, of course, but the Molecular Transformer recipe to convert Silver to Tin isn't available in the singleblock anymore, so you might want the easier option, since you're rocking two reactors and all. With the 2x overclock they're still produce millions of EU/t with the right Plasma Turbines, assuming you have them ready.

# Quest: Focus on Breeding
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c4a.name=Focus on Breeding
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c4a.desc=This side of the advanced fission branch will focus on the items you can get from nuclear fission. In terms of physics, this fission refers to atoms being broken into two parts, each of which generates a different atom. This has potential to produce some interesting stuff and, perhaps, replace some chemical lines.%n%nAs you advance, your rewards will scale just as the complexity does. However, this part is one where development has lagged behind, and some fission setups are poorly rewarding when it comes to byproducts. However, as those setups are updated, so will these quests, so check back on new updates to see what has changed!

# Quest: Focus On Power Generation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c56.name=Focus On Power Generation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c56.desc=Each side of this branch will focus on one of the two halves of nuclear fission outputs. This side will focus on generating power from the reactors available here, which is probably why you're here in the first place.%n%nThese setups share one purpose: when they were created, they were meant to bridge the gap between IC2 nukes and fusion, because there was really nothing else worth using beyond fluid nukes if there were no backups available, or redstone automation was too unreliable for vacuum nukes. Not only is there a full 2-tier gap of one single powergen until fusion, but there's also a required power input in order to begin a fusion reaction in the first place. This is both boring and difficult to push through, especially with the Assembly Line in the middle, so here we are.%n%nThe first setup you can put together is the LFTR chain, although only one half of it is available in IV. As such, that is where we will start.

# Quest: Liquid Fluorine Thorium Reactor
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c57.name=Liquid Fluorine Thorium Reactor
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c57.desc=What a complicated name this is. What does it mean?%n%nWell, it's what is called a molten salt reactor. The Liquid Fluoride part means that the nuclear fuel is actually a liquid, mixed in with fluoride salts. This is a mechanism that makes it more difficult to get the fuel ready for fission, but also makes the process more efficient, gives out more byproducts and also removes the danger of explosion. That's right, nuclear meltdowns are a thing of the past! The molten salt is designed to flow downwards into a hole where it solidifies, in case the reactor has problems, so it's impossible for the fission process to continue into an explosive mess.%n%nThere are three downsides, though. One of them was mentioned just above, the fuel needs more processing to be ready for the LFTR, and more input materials to reach the right mixture. After it goes through the reactor, it comes out as depleted, and this part too requires more processing steps, although it gives out a lot more useful chemicals than the single Lutetium/Plutonium the IC2 nuke depletion process gave. Lastly, the molten salt is very hot and very corrosive, which means it would destroy the materials used to build the IC2 nukes. You will need newer, stronger and more expensive materials to build a reactor, not to mention its much larger size. %n%nThe structure for this multi is truly something else. It has not one, but four required Dynamo Hatches, which should all be the Buffered type, either EV, IV or LuV depending on the fuel being fed into the reactor, with better fuels being unlocked at later progression stages. This means that one LFTR makes either 1 LuV amp, 1 ZPM amp or 1 UV amp while running. It also requires 2 Maintenance and 4 Muffler Hatches, when it has no maintenance problems or pollution output! Mysterious are the workings of this reactor.%n%nOther than this, all the inputs and outputs are fluids. The minimum amount you'll need is 2 inputs and 4 outputs, although one of the outputs comes out over time, and not on recipe finish. This output is Uranium 233, a very rare isotope that can get you deeper into LFTR fuels and more power, hardly obtainable from any other source.

# Quest: Inputs and Outputs in the LFTR
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c69.name=Inputs and Outputs in the LFTR
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c69.desc=Assuming you have both the LFTR and the Fuel Refinery built, and the inputs for the fuel available to be used, you can power up the reactor and leave it running. The first fuel you can use will work with 4 IV Energy Dynamos to output 4 IV amps, as long as the reactor runs, and each cycle lasts for 100 seconds (you can see the recipes on NEI, there's a tab dedicated to the 3 fuels the LFTR can run and what you get from them).%n%nWhat about everything else? The entire setup has 2 inputs and 4 outputs. One of the inputs is any of the 3 possible fuels, the other input is Lithium Tetrafluoroberyllate (LTFB). On the output side, there's one constant: U233 is output in small quantities at random, averaging 10 seconds per output. There are two other outputs, U Salt and UF6, that come from every fuel, although better fuels output more of these per cycle. Finally, T Salt or TB Salt can be outputted, the first from the first fuel and the second from the other two, with TB being more valuable than T. All of these are meant to be processed in order to reach better LFTR fuels, and also useful breeding byproducts.%n%nStarting with the first fuel, every bucket of it will need 2 buckets of LTFB, last 1000 seconds and output a total of 655.536.000 EU at 32.768 EU/t. After this, you will have 367L of U233 on average, 250L of U Salt, 500L of T Salt and 5L of UF6. As you can tell, this is a slow burner, and one bucket of each of these fluids is worth a lot!

# Quest: First Steps in Reprocessing
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c6a.name=First Steps in Reprocessing
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c6a.desc=You now have 4 different fluid outputs running away from your LFTR. Each of them needs specific attention, and all of them are useful. %n%nWhere to start looking? The best way to start is at the end, which is to say, the Fuel Refinery. You want to upgrade to the better fuels as soon as possible, and each one has 2 recipes: one with 4 inputs, similar to the recipe you've already done, and one with 2 inputs, focusing on LFTR Fuel Base. The 2-input recipes produce 10x the fuel, so they're much better, but you can't use this recipe alone. The Fuel Base can only be made from reprocessing depleted fuel, and you don't get enough of it to make the same amount of fuel spent. If you perfectly reprocess any of the first two fuels to get Fuel Base, you will come out short and run out of fuel.%n%nGiven that, your strategy will be to use two Fuel Refineries, one for each Fuel 2 recipe, and then change them to Fuel 3 once you've built the Assembly Line, which is required to build the final multiblocks in this line. For Fuel 2, get as much Fuel Base as you can from this chain - EBF <- DT <- RPU <- LFTR and put it into one of the refineries, while using the second one to top off on the remaining fuel you need to keep the LFTR going. You can limit the UF4 on the second refinery to not make too much fuel there, or just turn it on and off, and use as much of the better recipe as possible. You will be able to use the better recipe 100%% of the time, but only after building a Sparge Tower.%n%nAdditional details on the other outputs you can get from reprocessing can be found on the breeding side of this questline branch.

# Quest: Sparge Tower
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c59.name=Sparge Tower
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c59.desc=This is the last structure of the LFTR chain, and the only one gated after the Assembly Line. The best LFTR fuel, Fuel 3, is locked after this, and a lot of useful byproducts are only obtainable here as well, so it's important that you build this if you have a working LFTR.%n%nThe structure itself is very similar to a Distillation Tower, but with different blocks. The controller is the most expensive part, but the biggest obstacle is having the Assembly Line; everything after that shouldn't be too difficult. It's recommended that you have more than one tower, but for one focus on making only one. %n%nNote: the height of this tower is not adjustable. It is meant to be a 3x8x3 multiblock with at least 45 Sparge Tower Casings.

# Quest: Thorium Tetrafluoride and Fuel 3
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c7b.name=Thorium Tetrafluoride and Fuel 3
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c7b.desc=Whether you've mathed it out from NEI, looked at the spreadsheet or done something else, you might have figured something out: Fuel 3 is better in every way. More power, more byproducts, more everything. However, both recipes for it use Thorium Tetrafluoride (TF4), and the source of this is salt sparging, done in the Sparge Tower. Not only that, but Fuel 3 can only be consumed by having 4 LuV Buffered Dynamo Hatches in the LFTR, which means that it's a fair bit away from the previous steps in this chain.%n%nOnce you've made it there, though, you can start working on getting this fuel. To make it, you will need at least one Sparge Tower dedicated to using Fluorine, with T Salt or TB Salt (TB Salt is better, get it from Fuel 2). There is a recipe that uses Helium, but it's not required for Fuel 3 and is meant for byproducts, so the quest for it is in the breeding half of this branch. Using a single tower for both recipes is a bad idea, so don't do it!%n%nPreferably, you should input Fluorine and TB Salt and let it run for a while. Speeding up the recipe by overclocking and making more towers is a good idea, since the TF4 is your bottleneck now. Alongside it, you get several fluorides: Lithium, Neptunium, Technetium and Selenium. These might prove useful in the future, but your goal is the Thorium one.

# Quest: Naquadah Reactor For Nuclear Fuels
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c7c.name=Naquadah Reactor For Nuclear Fuels
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c7c.desc=What is the most powerful nuclear fission generator there is? The answer to that question isn't even a nuclear fission generator, for the most part. The answer is the Large Naquadah Generator. It follows the same principle as the LFTR, use a new processing chain to turn Thorium, Uranium and Plutonium into liquid fuels, very dense with energy, which are then slowly burned to generate large amounts of power over a very long period of time. This reactor, for example, burns its fuels 1 milibucket at a time, over several seconds, when running without additives, a very slow burner by default.%n%nLet's look at the NEI recipes. Excited Thorium outputs 2,200 EU/t, Excited Uranium outputs 12,960 EU/t and Excited Plutonium outputs 32,400 EU/t. These are small numbers, clearly, so this can't possibly be the most powerful nuclear fission reactor. However, this multi is more complicated than that! In total, there are 4 inputs you can provide for it: one of them is the required fuel and another is the also required Liquid Air to generate EU from that fuel, but the other 2 are additives that are optional, yet increase both the efficiency and the consumption speed of the fuel. The controller's tooltip lists all the possible additives and their bonuses.%n%nFuel efficiency here means that the fuel is burned at the same rate, but energy output is increased by the percentage. Let's consider the two best options, Cryotheum and Atomic Separation Catalyst. They multiply with each other, so the energy output is 2.75 x 16 = 44 times the displayed EU/t on NEI! Excited Plutonium, the most energetic of the three fuels, will award you with 1,425,600 EU/t, almost 3 UV amps.

# Quest: Exciting Liquid Nuking
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c6f.name=Exciting Liquid Nuking
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c6f.desc=With the reactor built, it's time to automate the fuel and additives, since there are additives this time. They are optional, so let's begin with the required inputs.%n%nLiquid Air is trivial to automate: it's a Vacuum Freezer job. Input energy and Air and output Liquid Air, there are quests for this. The fuels themselves are more complicated, but the three of them follow a similar set of recipes. First, you grab a lot of the radioactive element (Thorium, Uranium or Plutonium), wrap it in a specific foil and then put in an Implosion Compressor to make very dense nuggets. These are into the High Density items you need, which are then mixed with specific dusts to create the basic fuel fluid.%n%nThis part is where it becomes complicated, though. To get the energy out of this radioactive fluid, you need to activate it. Thorium is done by mixing with Helium Plasma (t1 fusion), while the other two are made directly in the Fusion Reactor (t2 fusion). The activated fuels can be thrown directly in the reactor to produce EU, at a very slow pace. Your bottleneck should be the main radioactive element, so make sure you can source it fast enough.%n%nBeing here, you should have a Large Naquadah Reactor ready to go. However, it is true that these Excited Fuels can be used to make fuel rods for IC2 nukes, with much larger heat outputs meant for fluid nukes. You can try to use them there, but there are no simulated setups of any kind for those rods, so it's going to be a very experimental setup if you ever decide to make it.

# Quest: Faster Lutetium Excitement

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c6c.desc=This quest is late LuV.%n%nYou might have read before that Lutetium is necessary as an input for fusion crafting. In a tier 2 fusion reactor, Lutetium + Chrome = Americium, a required material for many required crafts. Lutetium is a material that is obtained exclusively from breeding, so you're in the right place to find ways to get it.%n%nThe very first method, EV's IC2 Thorium nukes, is the cheapest, but also the slowest. Each fuel rod takes 50000 seconds to deplete, almost 14 hours, with half of a Lutetium Dust per depleted rod. Highly stackable designs, such as the 2-chamber 11 quad rod one, will grant you 22 dust per cycle. After building 10 of those, the rate is still 16 dust per hour. This processing speed isn't good enough to keep progressing forever, and there is no need to make more towers of breeder nukes. Instead, make liquid fuel.%n%nJust like before, you want to deplete it. The slowest step in the process takes 2500 seconds per bucket, but one bucket of depleted Thorium Based Liquid Fuel awards, on average, 96 Lutetium Dust. This is 138 per hour at the slowest rate! One Neutron Activator matches the speed of 86 of the IC2 nukes mentioned above, and that Neutron Activator is one of the two expensive parts of this multi. The other one is a tier 1 Fusion Reactor to make Helium Plasma and activate the Thorium Liquid Fuel.%n%nSo, you need Lutetium for fusion, but need fusion for this Lutetium? Yes, Helium Plasma is t1 fusion while the Americium recipe is only t2, so you have some time to accumulate Lutetium at a faster rate if you haven't done it already. To accomplish this, you will need a Precise Assembler to make the Neutron Activator, plus the MkI Fusion Reactor, and also some of the Naquadah line in the middle.%n%n§4§4Obtaining Lutetium with the neutron activator is no longer possible. Please hold while the quest book authors figure this out. I think the HTGR is the new method but you might just do bees at this point.

# Quest: Uranium and Plutonium Excitement
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c6d.name=Uranium and Plutonium Excitement
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c6d.desc=If you've done IC2 nukes, you must have seen this coming. The previous quest had fuel that was based on Thorium, so what comes next? Uranium and Plutonium, of course.%n%nThe byproducts you want are obtained directly from the depleted fuel, so the tasks to get through for power and breeding are exactly the same. However, since this part is about breeding, it's worth it to point out that the depleted fuel can be obtained from depleted fuel rods, after being processed in IC2 nukes. This is not the best way to do it, of course, but it bypasses the need for the Large Naquadah Reactor, an expensive multi even by ZPM standards. You will not get as much power if you don't use that multi, but you can get byproducts all the same.%n%nThe outputs themselves are quite interesting, or at least Plutonium's outputs are. Uranium will give you Lead, Bismuth (almost none), Cerium and a tiny bit of Xenon, which means that you get some Cerium and Xenon. Plutonium, on the other hand, awards you with Tritanium! This is a t2 fusion material that normally needs a lot of Radon to produce, alongside 2 separate fusion recipes, so it might be very useful to source Tritanium through the depleted Plutonium Liquid Fuel. If you do so, you'll also get some Krypton, with each bucket of depleted fuel outputting more than a 100 million Liquid Air recipe on the Distillation Tower, which is also true for the Xenon obtained from Uranium despite the very small amount obtained from it.

# Quest: High Temperature Super Breeder
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c6e.name=High Temperature Super Breeder
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c6e.desc=Have you heard of pebble reactors? There's a quest for the other one, the Thorium High Temperature Reactor, on the powergen side of this branch, but this is a diferent multiblock. %n%nIt's called the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR), and it uses fuel pebbles and consumes power. However, it doesn't really make a lot of power, and doesn't even match the EU/t of the other version, despite being much more expensive. The multiblock structure is basically the same, a huge reactor around 12x12x12 blocks in size, with 500+ casings made with Europium. What it doesn't make in power, it compensates in breeding, however.%n%nFor the unaware, this is expensive. Pebble reactors work by stuffing the reactor absolutely full of pebbles, and then the reaction will keep going for, essentially, forever. In this case, you will have a fully automated source of almost endless Lutetium, Plutonium and other things that will be explained in the following quests, alongside the production of fuel and the processing of outputs. What this means is that this is an expensive multiblock, but it's placed a tier in which this expense is actually reasonable, if there is a need for immense, endless breeding of many outputs.%n%nIf you're on the fence about building this, check the next quests to learn more about the fuel and outputs.%n%nNotes:%n%nHTGR has an internal buffer for fuel and only one input bus is required (any will do), as well as only one output bus (reactor automatically compresses every 64 burned pellets into one ball, so you need 6 slots or more to avoid problems with voiding at full capacity).%n%nReactor requires only 72k out of 720k pebbles to operate, but running at minimum capacity means that you will not get any bonuses, such as lower recipe time and higher amount of pebbles processed per cycle.%n%nThis multi consumes 1A LuV when operating, no matter how many pebbles are inside, but it also generates Hot Coolant as it runs. If you use it to generate power, you will gain more EU than is consumed by the reactor. %n%nIn this reactor, the throughput increases with the amount of pebbles put into it.%n%nBy typing HTGR in NEI, you can see all the items that are related to this multiblock.

# Quest: Pebble Reactor Fuels and Outputs
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c71.name=Pebble Reactor Fuels and Outputs
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c71.desc=Thorium, Uranium and Plutonium. There you go, quest done, onwards. I do find it kind of funny how it always goes back to these. Why is it that when there are problems, it's always you three?%n%nMaking the pebbles for any of these elements is a multi-step process. To get them, you need to throw in huge amount of the main radioactive fuel alongside some materials used to make the outer shell, namely Carbon, Silicon, and Graphite Dust.%n%nFor a full reactor, you will need thousands of stacks of each of these, much more than quest tasks could ask for. Anyways, the depleted pebbles can be centrifuge to recover most of the materials used to reach the final pebbles (Silicon, Graphite, Carbon), alongside a smaller chance at getting the main nuclear material for each kind of pebble. On top of that, you will get the breeding outputs: Lutetium from Thorium, Krypton from Uranium, Xenon from Plutonium.

# Quest: Radioactivity's Additives
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c7e.name=Radioactivity's Additives
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c7e.desc=The Naquadah Reactor has the potential to be an endgame power generator, but only if the right additives are used. These additives boost the EU/t output of the multi, but in different ways, and it's important to upgrade them as quickly as possible. However, going beyond the max output of the Dynamo Hatch is not a good idea!%n%nThere are two types of additives: the coolants and the fuel boosters. The coolants boost fuel efficiency, which means fuel consumption is the same, whereas the boosters increase the speed the multi burns the fuel, increasing the output at the same time.%n%nThere are three coolants, but the 275%% efficiency boost by using Cryotheum should not be ignored. To automate it, you will need an automated source of Blaze Rods and Snowballs (Snow is made from Water). To this, you add Redstone and Saltpeter, and you're done.%n%nThe boosters are more difficult to choose from. Caesium should be ignored, Uranium 235 can be automated from Uranium 238 with magic at an almost 1:1 ratio, but Naquadah is what you probably have ready to use for this, which quadruples the speed of this reactor. However, if this is too slow, you can instead automate Atomic Separation Catalyst to get a 16x speed boost! There are many recipes for this, so choose your favorite.

# Quest: The Fission Finale
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c70.name=The Fission Finale
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c70.desc=Here we are, at the end of fission.%n%nAt this time, you have more than entered the fusion tiers. In fact, the last fusion setups go as deep as t2 fusion, so you might be running both fission and fusion at the same time, although the latter is generally easier and more efficient once the structure is built.%n%nOne of the ultimate goals of fission is a filled HTGR, or its younger brother, the THTR, two very expensive multis that can grant you essentially infinite power or breeding products. However, the Naquadah Generator that has those excited nuclear fuels can do much more! The Naquadah fuel line is the reason why it was created, and it can replace t3 fusion and beyond by condensing powergen even more than fusion did, and replace the turbine spam.%n%nThose fuels aren't exactly nuclear fission, nor fusion, and more of a chemical line, so they were not included here. If interested, look at NEI to see what they have to offer.

# Quest: Maxed-out LFTR
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c7d.name=Maxed-out LFTR
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c7d.desc=An LuV LFTR running on Fuel 3 outputs 4 ZPM amps per tick, or 524,288 EU/t. Each bucket is worth 1,048,576,000,000 EU, more than a trillion EU! Certainly, this is the most power-dense fuel you've ever held, and now that you've made it here, you can make it to fusion and beyond much more easily. But wait, there's more!%n%nYou might have noticed that the limiting factor in using the best recipe for Fuel 1 and Fuel 2 was the U Salt, which ultimately makes the LFTR Fuel Base. You just can't get enough of it to drop that inefficient 4-input recipe. However, the increased output of U Salt from Fuel 3, alongside the doubling that you can get from processing Helium Sparged U Salt instead of the regular one, means that you can use the 2-input recipe to make all your fuel from now on! If you haven't set up Helium Sparge Towers yet, do so now.%n%nWhen you do this, you can grab the two Fuel Refineries you should have and set them both to the 2-input recipe. Each bucket of Fuel 3 takes 9000 seconds to make, but is consumed in 4000 seconds, so it's good to have more than one Refinery per LFTR. With this, you will make fuel much faster, and generate much more EU than before. If you continue expanding, it's very possible to match the first tiers of fusion power from something like this.

# Quest: Second Half of LFTR Breeding
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c6b.name=Second Half of LFTR Breeding
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c6b.desc=There are two gas inputs that the Sparge Tower accepts: Helium and Fluorine. Each one works on different depleted salts (U Salt, T Salt, TB Salt) in a specific way. Helium works with U Salt to make the most valuable byproducts, while Fluorine works with the other two salts to make other byproducts and TF4, which is required to make the LFTR Fuel 3. Here, we'll focus on Helium and U Salt, and the other recipes will be covered on the powergen side of the branch.%n%nAll the U Salt you get from the LFTR, from any fuel, can be ran through the Sparge Tower. It's an additional step that is slow, yet rewarding. The recipe is HV-tier, but it's recommended that you overclock it, and maybe even build multiple towers to accelerate it. All the U Salt you have should pass through these, because sparging it outputs almost every noble gas! Xenon, Neon, Argon, Krypton and Radon will be outputted over time, precious gases to speed up EBF recipes and save up lots of energy, and also for the Void Miner. Radon, on the other hand, is required to make Quantum Eyes, Quantum Stars and many other important items.%n%nEven though you get many gases, the speed at which you'll get them isn't great, since it depends on the speed at which LFTR fuel is being consumed. This should not be your only source of these gases, but it is a completely EU-free way to get them, considering the amount of energy the LFTR produces.

# Quest: Nuclear Fuel Processing
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c68.name=Nuclear Fuel Processing
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c68.desc=The previous reactor is useless on its own, unfortunately. Even if you have built it fully, there's no way to get fuel that it will accept without making another multi that mixes and processes several chemical mixtures into one, the molten salt that generates all that nuclear energy in the LFTR.%n%nThe multi's name is Reactor Fuel Processing Plant (RFPP), although it's easier to call it the Fuel Refinery. It's a mid-late IV multiblock, like the LFTR, especially due to needing 2 ZPM circuits for the Computer Cube used in the controller's recipe. The other casings are similar to what you've made before, and the tooltip gives a good description of what exactly is needed to build the Fuel Refinery. %n%nWhere to put each casing? The bottom two layers are 3x3, and they take the Structural Blocks. On top of the second layer, in the middle block, make a tower of 5 Fluid Containment Blocks, and then cover these with Sealant Blocks, like you would do in a Multiblock Miner. However, the second layer of the 5, from the bottom, uses Reactor Shielding Blocks, 4 of them there instead of the Sealant Blocks. Use the Hologram Projector for assistance if you're having trouble.%n%nWhen it's fully built, you can focus on the recipes. Out of the 5 that are available, you can only do one at this time, the Fuel 1 recipe. To make this fuel, you need molten U235, but also Lithium Fluoride, Beryllium Fluoride and Zirconium Tetrafluoride. Each of the these elements can be obtained with relative ease, each in their own way, but Fluorine is the main part of all this, the main component of the molten salt, so it's a good idea to have a decent source of it. However, the LFTR fuels are also very, very energy dense, so each bucket of Fluorine can bring you a long way.%n%nIf you're looking through NEI, your first response might be "There are no recipes for these fluorides other than reprocessing the depleted fuels! How am I supposed to make these?". The answer is in the dusts: you have to craft the dusts and then fluid extract them into the fluids. There is a spreadsheet which has all the steps in crafting and reprocessing (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1JGSt5-ELdra6emngUc7XvKSJc-_-RO0yreRIbOrx0/edit?usp=sharing), to help with how complicated this chain is. %n%nJust make sure you remember, each bucket of fuel is worth many millions, perhaps even billions of EU! Don't let the 207M EU cost per bucket of Fuel 1 discourage you, it turns into much more energy in the LFTR. Besides, this first fuel is just a stepping stone, so don't worry about fully automating everything just yet, the final setup is different from this one.

# Quest: First Half of LFTR Breeding
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c58.name=First Half of LFTR Breeding
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c58.desc=The LFTR processing chain has two halves, with the first being in mid-late IV and the second requiring the Assembly Line and more materials to finish. Aside from power, both of these halves have special outputs that can be helpful for progression, but the second half is most likely the one that holds the most value. Regardless, the full processing chain around the reactor and its fuel will keep outputting everything, so it's worth it to look at what it gives.%n%nLet's start with the LFTR Fuel 1 outputs, after the fuel is consumed in the reactor. U233 and UF6 are both used to make more fuel. U233 will be used until you have Sparge Towers to improve your fuel production, while UF6 is a part of the good fuel recipe that you always want to use. T Salt is processed in the Reactor Processing Unit to yield Proactinium, which decays into even more U233, and then in the Cold Trap to yield more U233 and UF6.%n%nRemember: U233 is the early source of fuel, UF6 is the one you will switch to as you progress.%n%nMeanwhile, U Salt also processes into more fuel, but with a bonus of automated Phosphorous Dust. Unfortunately, you won't get a lot of it, but it is still a breeding output from the nuclear fission and is needed for GT++ alloys and other purposes.%n%nTB Salt is very similar to T Salt, but with higher amounts of the same output and also Beryllium Fluoride, whose output grows into more than what you used when you reach the later parts of the chain. Free Beryllium!

# Quest: Fission Guidelines
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c4b.name=Fission Guidelines
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c4b.desc=The branch to the left and to the right are both about nuclear fission, or the midgame content about fusion. If you're looking for fusion, you went the wrong way! Go straight down for that content, although it only begins in LuV.%n%nOn the left side, the top side is the beginning of it all, with your usual IC2 nukes that were developed more than 10 years ago. On the bottom, the neat and powerful upgrades to those nukes, either fluid or vacuum.%n%nOn the right side, the top side is dedicated to power, whereas the bottom side is dedicated to breeding (byproducts). This covers the more GTNH-exclusive fission content, all of which comes after IC2 nukes, and generally builds on their concept to work faster and pump out more complex, and often more useful things.

# Quest: Thorium as Breeding Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c53.name=Thorium as Breeding Fuel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c53.desc=Alternatively, you might choose to only process Thorium for its main output, Lutetium. This is important because Lutetium is required to make Americium in a Fusion Reactor down the line, and that is a recipe you will need to do in order to progress. Your objective is to breed Thorium into Lutetium, which means you might want to focus on a breeder reactor.%n%nWhat is a breeder reactor? In this case, it's an IC2 nuke designed to consume as much Thorium as possible. The main cost here is the amount of chambers or nuke components you'll have to make. If you want to save on Overclocked Heat Vents, make a tower of 0-chamber nukes, each with the following setup:%n%nRPR%nORP%nRPR%nPRP%nRPR%nORP%n%nR -> Single Fuel Rod of Thorium (9 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (2 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (7 needed)%n%nOtherwise, if you have excess Overclocked Heat Vents and want to save up on chambers, turn to this setup:%n%nORORORO%nROEOEOR%nORORORO%nROROROR%nOPOPOPO%nROROROR%n%nE -> Heat Exchanger (2 needed)%nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Thorium (16 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (21 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (3 needed)%n%n(Each of the latter is worth 7x the former in terms of breeding.)%n%nTo complete this quest, you'll need to get Lutetium from one cycle of the any reactor setup. Which setup you choose is up to you, of course.

# Quest: Fuel Input Automation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c55.name=Fuel Input Automation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c55.desc=Reactor Platings. These are very important for automation, although their supposed use is not this one. They serve to increase the maximum temperature of the reactor, but that is useless to you because you'll be using heat-neutral setups. Instead, they are simply the cheapest way to fill every slot of your nukes, except for those where fuel rods need to go.%n%nAs you know, the placement of each component is critical to keep the reactor safe. Fuel automation is as simple as just pushing fuel rods into the reactor, but you need to make it so the open slots are the only safe places for the rods. From there, you can extract with a filter set to the depleted version of the rods you are using. and the exchange will happen seamlessly.%n%nFrom there, you can turn the depleted rods into usable rods by putting them in the Thermal Centrifuge, adding back the fuel that wasn't recycled (each type of rod recycles different amounts of fuel) and the Empty Fuel Rods/Steel Rods.

# Quest: Can We Get Uranium Here?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c60.name=Can We Get Uranium Here?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c60.desc=Yes, you can. In fact, you can get it much earlier than EV, but the speed at which you get it can vary wildly, depending on how you approach this problem. Uranium is the main upgrade to Thorium in nukes, with a lot more power to give and a different useful breeding byproduct, but you need about 3 stacks of Uranium 238 to set up the most powerful basic IC2 Uranium Nuke.%n%nHow do you get it, though? The one answer is, you get it from Thorium. Looking at NEI, the Thorium ore processing has a chance to give Uranium dusts, which you can use as fuel, but this happens very slowly, especially considering that Thorium is a rare ore in the Nether, even if each ore block gives 4 crushed dust. The reality seems to be that fast Uranium only happens when you can mine from t2 planets, but this is not the only way. There is a secret, and this secret involves IC2 crops.%n%nHow does it work? Well, it's simple. The IC2 crop that corresponds to Thorium, the God of Thunder, can quadruple each Crushed Thorium Ore into 4 Purified Thorium Ore, but it also outputs, in fluid form, one Uranium Ingot! This means that each Thorium Ore gives you 4 Uranium Ingots, and with around 42 ore, you can do one cycle of that big reactor setup. God of Thunder needs the ore under it, though, so make sure you save some for that purpose.%n%nEV Uranium nukes are a achievement intended mostly for IC2 crop users, so this quest won't demand something like that. Still, it's a useful secret, so here it is. Additionally, the Uranium crop quest in the questbook awards you with 32 Pitchblende when you complete it, which might prove useful for both for quadrupling Uranium and getting Radium for Radon!

# Quest: Uranium Basic Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c61.name=Uranium Basic Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c61.desc=The big brother to the Thorium nuke, the Uranium nuke. The biggest setup you can put together for a single IC2 Nuclear Reactor uses 7 Quad Uranium Rods, or 28 single rods. This amounts to almost 3 stacks of Uranium 238 (U238), a difficult amount to get from Thorium but much easier to get from the green ores found in Phobos. The setup is very similar to the previous one, but with some important differences. What are they?%n%nThe first one is the fuel. These fuel rods use a mixture of U238 and a bit of U235, which is rarer. To get U235, you can gamble on the chance of getting the dust from processing some of the related ores, which might be good enough, but it's also possible to use Thaumcraft to convert 9 nuggets of U238 to 7 nuggets of U235, without needing a lot of Thaumcraft progress. Assembling this fuel and putting it into rods gets it ready to be used for power, with more EU/t but less burn time compared to Thorium, 50000 seconds for Thorium compared to 20000 seconds for Uranium.%n%nThe second difference in the nuke setup. Uranium eats up more per rod, so a different arrangement inside the nuke is required. For the highest EU/t in this situation, 4200 EU/t, the setup is:%n%nRVOEOOVOP%nPVOOVOORO%nPOROOROOV%nVOOVOOVOP%nOROOROORO%nPOVPOVPOV%n%nE -> Component Heat Exchanger (1 needed)%nV -> Component Heat Vent (11 needed)%nO -> Overclocked Heat Vent (28 needed)%nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Uranium (7 needed)%nP -> Reactor Plating (7 needed)%n%nWhen the fuel rods get repleted, you can reprocess them to get 3/4 of the U235 back, and also a bit of Plutonium.

# Quest: Plutonium 239
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c64.name=Plutonium 239
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c64.desc=Red as an ingot, white as a blob. These are the same element, and the same isotope, even if they don't seem like it.%n%nPlutonium is a major part of nuclear fission reaction, mainly as an product of Uranium fissile fuel, when an atom in the mix captures a neutron and then emits an electron and an anti-neutrino. After several hours in the reactor, the fuel is considered depleted and there's enough Plutonium in it to separate the two through thermal centrifuging, a basic and inefficient way to do nuclear reprocessing. Later on, it's possible to improve your methods of handling spent nuclear fuel, but this is the first way you get this nuclear byproduct.%n%nIf you've made Quantum Eyes, you might know one of the main uses of Plutonium: to get Radium. By having enough of it to serve as a catalyst in the reaction, you can convert Uranium to Radium in small quantities without losing any Plutonium. Since you need 6 ingots, you will have to do 3 cycles of the setup shown in the quest before this one, or more if you're running smaller Uranium nukes. However, there is another useful thing you can use this for at this time: more nuclear fuel.%n%nNot just more nuclear fuel, but a different, more complex but also more powerful nuclear fuel. It's known as MOX fuel, and it is essentially a mix of Uranium and Plutonium. The catch is that all the Plutonium spent on creating the fuel is returned to you when reprocessing the depleted rods, alongside the extra you usually get, but not the Uranium return. To source a nuke of this kind, you will need more than 6 ingots.

# Quest: MOX Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c67.name=MOX Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c67.desc=Upon gathering more Plutonium, you can try building a MOX nuke, the most powerful of the basic nukes. It is a 6-chamber, like usual, and it takes U238 as before, but it outputs close to 6820 EU/t while only using 5 quad rods instead of 7. How is this possible? The answer is... MOX.%n%nMOX means mixed-oxide, which is the name given to the mix of Uranium and Plutonium. In here, rods with this fuel are special in the sense that they don't output a specific amount of EU/t from the usual nuke mechanics. On top of those, it also reacts to the heat of the reactor, generating more energy the hotter it is. To compensate, these rods last only half the time that the Uranium fuel rods do, but their total EU is higher if they are active in very hot reactors. This imposes an obvious problem - hot reactors are not good for your base.%n%nThere is one standardized way of dealing with this: heat-neutral reactors. What this means is that the reactor's temperature does not change while it's active, because the components inside are not interacting with the reactor's temperature value, only with the value of other components like the fuel rods themselves. This limits the type of components you can use, and you'll find that Advanced Heat Vents are now required (the overclocked ones interact with the reactor itself). However, at the same time, you can use any fuel rod to heat the reactor up to a high temperature and then activate a setup of this kind, which ensures safety and efficiency in MOX nukes.%n%nVAAV%nARRA%nVAAV%nVAAV%nARRA%nVAAV%n%nA - Advanced Heat Exchanger (12 needed)%nV - Component Heat Vent (8 needed)%nR - Dual Fuel Rod of MOX (4 needed)%n%n1200-2730 EU/t%n%n(This setup is the most efficient per MOX fuel rod, if you're short on fuel, which you shouldn't be if you're doing a MOX setup)%n%nAEAVPVAEA%nVARAVARAV%nAVAVAVAVA%nEAVARAVAE%nARAVAVARA%nVAEAVAEAV%n%nA - Advanced Heat Vent (26 needed)%nE - Component Heat Exchanger (6 needed)%nV - Component Heat Vent (16 needed)%nR - Quad Fuel Rod of MOX (5 needed)%nP - Reactor Plating (1 needed)%n%n3000-6825 EU/t%n%n(This setup is the most efficient per Advanced Heat Vent)%n

# Quest: Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c52.name=Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c52.desc=Eventually, the previous nukes will not be big enough. You can make more of them, to get more power, but it's clear that you need something bigger. Bigger, literally. The next step in nuclear fission starts with a bigger multiblock, built on top of the original nuke. By surrounding it with a 5x5x5 cube of Reactor Pressure Vessels, it will become a different type of multiblock, the fluid nuke.%n%nAfter doing this, there's no direct EU generation anymore. The main output of a working fluid nuke is Hot Coolant, a fluid that can be turned into Steam or Superheated Steam in another multi, the Large Heat Exchanger (LHE). Steam means power, as you already know, so the obvious chain of processes here is a fluid nuke into an LHE, and then into Steam Turbines. These added steps are required to make EU from a nuke of this type (or, at least, they're the most popular way of doing it), but this work is rewarded by the final EU/t output of the setup, which is much larger than a regular nuke's output with the same amount of fuel.%n%nThe difference exists because regular nukes actually have a 50%% penalty to EU/t. It's such a big step-up that, in reality, one fluid nuke is enough for IV power, if it's powerful enough. The one in this quest, though, is not that one, because fluid nukes in general have some additional complications that will be harder to deal with it. In fact, for this, you have the option to use Thorium as fuel and still get a good amount of power! What you will need are the fluid nuke blocks, but there is an optional task for this setup that only needs some blocks from the setup.

# Quest: Automation for Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c7f.name=Automation for Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c7f.desc=If you've looked at the wiki setups, you might have seen some that seem harder to automate than others. Particularly, that one with two kinds of Uranium Rods. More than filling empty slots with Reactor Platings to force all the inputs to move to the specific slots where the rods must go, this one needs each rod to go in a specific slot!%n%nThe solution for this is a GT cover. The Robot Arm does the same action of moving items around as the Conveyor, but it moves to specific slots. With this, you can move the Dual Rod to where it needs to be, and the Quad Rods can fill the remaining slots as intended. If you're using other setups, you can use a similar logic to do your automation.

# Quest: Large Heat Infrastructure
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c54.name=Large Heat Infrastructure
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c54.desc=A required intermediate machine between your fluid nukes and your power is the Large Heat Exchanger (LHE). It takes in a hot fluid, in this case Hot Coolant, and transforms Distilled Water into Steam or Superheated Steam depending on how fast the hot fluid is coming in. It's important to only use Distilled Water here, because the Steam Turbines will output and recycle it back to the LHE.%n%nFor this purpose, you will need around one LHE per fluid nuke if you're doing one of the good setups from the wiki. None of them will reach the maximum flow one LHE can accept, but any setup above 800 HU will give you Superheated Steam, which is more efficient for EU and what you want to get.%n%nIf your setup does not match that 800 HU threshold, you can use a Hot Coolant buffer and set up a redstone latch so that the Hot Coolant flows in fast enough, until the buffer is almost empty. ProjectRed has a special block that acts as the latch, and you will then need two redstone signals that scale with the amount of fluid stored in your buffer tank. One of the signals should be normal, and the other reversed.%n%n

# Quest: EV vs. IV
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c80.name=EV vs. IV
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c80.desc=Your sourcing of Uranium is gonna be very small in EV, unless you use crops. Similarly, your ability to put together the multiblocks needed for the fluid nuke will be better in IV, since you can mine Small Titanium Ore directly, and use GT++ multis. %n%nAll in all, it becomes very worthwhile to rush the Tier 2 Rocket and land on Mars and Phobos to get Uranium and Tungstate/Scheelite, before you go much farther with IC2 nukes. In IV, fluid nukes are one of the best choices for efficient power without a lot of setup, although it's very viable to use Thorium and not just Uranium.%n%nEither way, it's recommended to have a multiblock Miner in either the Nether or Phobos, to source your Thorium or Uranium.

# Quest: Powering-up Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5e.name=Powering-up Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5e.desc=The previous setup's EU/t might not have impressed you. You have enough materials to put together the fluid nuke structure, but you want something more than what you've seen before. What kind of setup is powerful enough to output several IV amps, and sustain a developed IV base on its own? That sort of setup is shown in this quest, but it requires more multiblocks, and therefore more expense than the previous quest's chain. The fuel is the same, Uranium, so at this point it's certainly the least of your worries, until you try to automate the fuel input, at least.%n%nThe components inside the nuke get more and more complicated, so at this point I'm going to ask you to look at the wiki, under the Nuclear Reactors page (https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Nuclear_Reactors), and scroll down to the fluid nuke setups, specifically the 1352 HU, 2 Quad Uranium and 1408, 3 Quad Uranium, 1 Dual Uranium ones. The main difference between these two setups is that the first needs Iridium Neutron Reflectors, which are quite expensive if you haven't done the platline yet, while the second doesn't use them but is harder to automate due to having more than one type of rod.%n%nWhat's the final EU/t output, at 150%% turbine efficiency? 30240 and 31680 EU/t, respectively.%n%nAfter automating the nuke itself, there is still more to do, though. The LHE is required, as usual, but these setups cause something new to happen: the LHE starts outputting Superheated Steam, due to the high flow of hot coolant that it receives, which means that you need two sets of turbines instead of one. This type of steam must go into Large HP Steam Turbines, which use a good amount of Tungstensteel for the controller and stacks of Titanium for the casings. After those, it goes into the usual Large Steam Turbines, and the process is complete.%n%nThere is yet another new thing to worry about, in case all of this wasn't enough: the Steam flow is very high, higher than before, which means it's likely you will need 3 or more of each turbine type, further compounding on the costs you'll have here. Oriharukon and MAR-Ce-M200 are your best choices. Are you willing to tackle this setup?

# Quest: Thorium vs. Uranium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c81.name=Thorium vs. Uranium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c81.desc=Thorium and Uranium have a lot of differences, but also a lot of similarities.%n%nIn general, Uranium is a better fuel, but fluid nukes do not follow that general rule. Because they do not output any EU/t, and simply convert heat to Hot Coolant, the difference between the two fuels becomes minimal and Thorium stands out as being much easier to get and turn into fuel rods. The maximum amount of heat you can safely move around in a reactor limits the amount of Uranium Fuel Rods you can use, which means that your HU value will not be as high as you would have wanted.%n%nFor regular and vacuum IC2 nukes, however, Uranium has a big advantage. Especially in vacuum nukes, which are the most powerful, the efficient cooling through the cells makes it so a lot of Uranium can be processed at once, which returns incredible amounts of EU/t. The different conversion from fuel to energy between fluid and vacuum means that Thorium is very good for fluid nukes, whereas Uranium is very good for vacuum nukes.

# Quest: Vacuum Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5f.name=Vacuum Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5f.desc=What's the next step, running nuclear reactors in a perfect vacuum? That would be pretty funny, I'd like to see that.%n%nDisclaimer: this last step is not very stable. It's very risky to do it in servers with no backups, because it relies on redstone circuits to keep the reactor from exploding. Use multiple failsafes to guarantee safety. Never ever build a vacuum nuke in a Thermos server!%n%nVacuum nukes are an interesting GTNH-specific setup. They use only three components: fuel rods, platings to fill the empty slots for automation purposes, and coolant cells. Those cells you have used to make Energy Hatches, for example, they're used here to keep the reactor from overheating and exploding. The main difference this setup has is that these cells are consumable, and will wear out over time. You will need to add fresh cells into the reactor to keep running it safely, but the crux of the show is that you don't need to make new ones - you just need to cool them down again.%n%nThe Vacuum Freezer! That's why it's called a vacuum nuke! Elementary, my dear Steve. This kind of setup relies on using EU to refill the coolant cells, so to speak, and get much more EU from the reactor than you spend to keep it running. However, the redstone automation for this is quite tricky. If you just try it blindly, it might take you a long time to figure it out, and it might have explosive results. Check the Vacuum Reactors page on the wiki (https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Vacuum_Reactors) if you want a detailed guide that goes far beyond what I could write in this quest description.%n%nThis quest task is for the last setup shown in the wiki, specifically the 8720-43600 EU, 40 Quad Uranium setup. As the title implies, it can produce up to 43600 EU/t, but it will require multiple filters and failsafes to run it safely. The bonus, compared to fluid nukes, is that the LHE + turbine setup is not necessary for these high output numbers.

# Quest: Max Danger Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c82.name=Max Danger Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c82.desc=Were you courageous enough to build a vac nuke? If so, are you courageous enough to do it in a MOX setup, with high heat?%n%nYes, this is possible, and extremely powerful. However, all the risks you signed up for are exponentially increased, since MOX nukes keep getting better and better the closer the nuke's temperature is to the critical point. This sort of automation is more complicated than almost any other, and I honestly don't have any specific guidelines for you. %n%nIf you manage this, do share it on the Discord. I bet people will be surprised.

# Quest: Further IC2 Nuke Potential
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c62.name=Further IC2 Nuke Potential
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c62.desc=An observant nuclear scientist might have seen many more options for IC2 nukes than those mentioned in the quests up to this point. Thorium, Uranium, Thorium, Uranium... what about all of these other things, what do they do?%n%nUnfortunately, this is where the copying of builds ends. The nuke research that has been done is almost all about the fuel rods that existed from base IC2, namely the Thorium, Uranium and MOX ones. Almost all the others were added with GTNH, and they are more or less ignored by most players. However, not all of them are useless! To see why, keep reading.%n%nGoodGenerators has added two new pairs of Uranium and Plutonium rods: High Density, and Excited. Both of these use a lot more of the element per rod, to the extent where you'll need stacks and stacks of each to run a single nuke, which means that these are fuels for later in progression, when you have stockpiled a lot of U238. The main difference is that High Density rods output a lot more EU/t with the same heat output, whereas the Excited rods do output a lot more heat than usual. This means that the former are good for vacuum nukes, while the latter are good for fluid nukes. This is true because vac nukes want more EU/t from rods with less heat, to make the coolant cells last longer, while fluid nukes produce Hot Coolant directly from the amount of heat dissipated into the reactor. The Plutonium versions also have MOX-like behavior, while the Uranium ones don't.%n%nThis is not the end of high-powered nukes, though. There is a special, one-of-a-kind fuel rod called The Core, and there is a single vac nuke setup in the wiki using these things that outputs 7.906.206 EU/t, or about 3 amps of UHV. A truly ridiculous number, matching the truly ridiculous cost of making the fuel itself. This is a setup for a time in which you shouldn't be using IC2 nukes anymore, a true challenge for the mad nuclear scientist.%n%nWhat else is there? Unfortunately, not much. Every other fuel rod is largely useless. Tiberium rods can breed Zirconium and Xenon, if you need them, Lithium breeds Tritium and the Naquadah rods are unbelievably bad at generating power, which many other better reactors to use the Naquadah in. In terms of power, nothing else is worth using.

# Quest: High Density Vacuum Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c63.name=High Density Vacuum Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c63.desc=Throw more U238 at it!%n%nIf you ever though that a vacuum nuke doesn't burn through Uranium fast enough, this one is for you. High Density Uranium, or HDU, outputs twice the EU of the regular Uranium rods, and lasts for 70000 seconds instead of 20000. The heat output, like mentioned before, is the same, so the actual effect of using these rods in a vacuum nuke setup is that your final EU/t per nuke is multiplied by 2, and rods will need to be replaced less often, but the U238 consumption per cycle is a lot higher.%n%nThis also helps if you aren't automating the fuel rod input, since each one lasts longer. It's better if it's automated, but there's no danger of explosions if this part is done manually, so it's technically safe, as long as your EU buffer doesn't start complaining from lack of input.%n%nAs the last step before using The Core, you have High Density Plutonium. This HDP has MOX-like behavior, so it can output even more EU/t than HDU, up to several LuV amps per nuke, but you need to keep it running at high temperatures, which means even more risk! There is no such thing as too much safety, if you try to put one of these together.

# Quest: Excited Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c65.name=Excited Fluid Nukes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c65.desc=This quest is after the vacuum nuke one because the fuel required to do a setup like this is harder to get. Whereas the previous rods were made with compressed Uranium, this fuel needs that same material to then be further processed in GoodGenerators machines, namely the Neutron Activator, to make Excited Uranium Liquid Fuel. It is directly usable in the Naquadah Reactor, with more fuel efficiency there, but you might not be able to build it yet, since it's post-fusion. Instead, you can use said fuel here.%n%nBefore attempting this, you need to know all the mechanics related to the fluid nuke. In fact, this quest won't even have any required tasks, given how challenging it is to create a good setup of this kind. At the time of writing this quest, there is no nuke simulator that supports the Excited Fuel Rods, which means you'll have to first test in Creative mode and gather whatever results you get from there.%n%nThe basis for this setup is simple: Excited Uranium Fuel Rods, the only kind you should consider for this, output 16x more heat than the regular ones, which is a lot more Hot Coolant output if you can send all this heat to the reactor to be turned into power. Only the heat matters, which means that extra EU/t based on temperature will do nothing here. Throw as many rods as you can at this nuke without overheating, that is the challenge.%n%nWhat then? You will surely need many multis if you want to process LuV amps of power, unless you choose some more advanced options. The LHE upgrades into the EHE, the Extreme Heat Exchanger, and this new multi can output either Superheated or Supercritical Steam. For the former, use XL Steam Turbines to process the ludicrous amount of Steam you will be getting. For the latter, you need special turbines.

# Quest: Nukes - Summarized

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c66.desc=IC2 nukes will fall off when you arrive at fusion energy, for the most part. Although the highest EU/t numbers obtained from these newer, more powerful cells haven't been calculated yet, it is more likely that you will be using them to process the excited materials instead of focusing your powergen on them. %n%nThat said, it is possible to push them very far by using a bigger Heat Exchanger (there are two kinds) and XL Turbines, if going fluid, or by putting together a lot of vacuum nukes. If you want to choose the latter ones, due to their direct EU/t, then there's one last step: The Core.%n%nThese are super-powerful fuel rods that can create UHV setups, as long as you cool them down with the most powerful coolant cells there are. A setup for this exists in the wiki, but the most difficult part will be the redstone automation. These babies will turn your base into a mini Sun, if you let them, so you best have practiced your redstone skills!

However, there are also other obscure types, such as wrench nukes, which might or might not work in the current version. Additionally, someone suggested you could disassemble a nuke to reset the heat amount?%n%nThose are memes, but if any new viable type of IC2 nuke is ever introduced, it will be explained in this section.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000007f.desc=Welcome to Project Red!%n%nThis quest will teach you the basics of Projectred and show you how to set up a Ghetto AE system.%n%nThe Ghetto AE system will be really useful for sorting all of your first items%n%nFirst of all there are different types of pipes: %n%nItem Transport pipes are the most basic pipes, classified as Null-logic. They don't do anything besides connect other pipes together.%nItem Transport pipes only have the ability to take items that enter it and pass them along to another connected pipe. They will NOT connect to inventories at all. In a junction where there is more than 1 possible direction, item payloads will travel in a randomly selected direction.%n %nRouted pipes are the most advanced. These pipes 'communicate' with one-another to form pipe networks, in order to allow for incredibly complicated demand driven systems, with absolutely no redstone circuitry required.%n %nPressurized pipes are pipes that use a pressure based routing system where the payload travels to the closest inventory that can accept it. Finding the closest inventory is influenced by both distance and Pressure Resistance Pipes (which, to the path finder, are 1000 blocks long), but the actual path that items take is only influenced by distance.%n%nHowever, in order to control the logic of the routed pipes you will need special circuit chips.%n%n§4Note: I have no idea how PR works, or if this questline is entirely a duplicate, and have zero willpower to read all the boring text and find out, so I just unhid them since no one came forward with any info after I asked. If it should be removed or w/e, make a ticket.

# Quest: Can u eat those?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002e1.name=Can u eat those?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002e1.desc=No you can't eat them but you can add them to your routed pipes. Without chips routed pipes can't do anything on their own, chips also have a GUI to configure them which can be opened by right clicking. %nThere are 8 types of chips:%n%n-Item extractor chip can be used to send items from its inventory to responder, dynamic responder, terminator and overflow responder chips in a pipe network. %n%n-Item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network which match the filter configured to the inventory connected to the responder chip. Chips with higher priority value will receive items first until the inventory is full then will be sent to other inventories with valid filters and remaining space.%n%n-Dynamic item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network that match items inside the dynamic item responder connected inventory. This chip has to be in the same interface pipe as the item responder chip in order to work. Priority rules apply here as well. %n%n-Item overflow responder works exactly the same as the item responder chip, however it only accepts items that cannot go to an item responder chip, dynamic item responder chip, or item terminator chip. %n%n-Item terminator chip works as a backup for responder chips.%n%n-Item broadcaster chip will show you the inventory connected to the routed request pipe on the pipe network and can be used to retrieve items from it. They can also extract from the side you configure. %n%n-Item stock keeper chip will constantly check the network for items and pull them to its pipe. If the chip is set to pull when empty, it will only pull if the inventory next to it is empty, otherwise it will pull when there are less items in the inventory than configured in the chip.%n%n-Item crafting chips craft things. %n%n-Item crafting extension chips are placed inside the item crafting chips. Make sure you randomize the id.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002e3.desc=§4Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will kill TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.§r%n%nNow that you are familiar with the mod it's time to organize items in your base a bit. These are the things you need in order to get a basic extract/insert system.%n%nFirst of all you will need a drawer controller. You can pick it from here or craft it yourself and place it down. Next to it add as much drawers as you want, and make sure they are touching each other or the controller.%n%nThe next step is to connect a routed interface pipe to your drawer controller. Take the item responder chip and configure it to filter mode: blacklist (this will allow you to get any items from your system) and add the chip to the routed interface pipe by right clicking on it. Don't forget the dynamic item responder.%n%nIn order to allow your system to be able to see items you need to add the item broadcast chip TO THE SAME ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE DRAWER CONTROLLER.%n%nThe last step is to connect a routed request pipe IN THE SAME NETWORK AS THE ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE and right click it to access the GUI. You can only extract items from it. In order to insert items simply right click them on the drawer controller. %n%nYou can find more complex tutorials on youtube for autocrafting.

# Quest: Input chest for Ghetto ME System

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000060c.desc=To be able to put items into the Ghetto ME system you need just a few additional pipes.%nThe Extraction pipe should be connected to the chest you want to take items from.%nInside the Extraction pipe you need to put the Item Extraction chip, and configure it to blacklist if you want it to take all items from the chest.%n%nThe Routed Junction pipe is needed so the items inside the pipes know which direction to take, without this they will just fly around inside the pipes without knowing where to go.%nYou might also need some additional item transport pipes depending on your setup.

# Quest: Let's Get Some Pipes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000657.name=Let's Get Some Pipes
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000657.desc=First we're gonna need some pipes to connect everything. Do not use these pipes in junctions or the items will choose which path to go at random and you don't want that.%n%n§3Keep in mind PR automation is laggy, so don't use it more than the minimum you can get away with on servers, wait until AE2 for that. In SP, do what you want, but keep in mind that AE2 is way more powerful.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000065a.desc=Now you need to make some chips to use in those interface pipes. These ones do not do anything but are needed as a material for crafting the others.%n%nNow would be a good time to look into IC2 crops to get all the dyes you will need for your advanced chips.%n%n§3If NEI's bookmarks are blocking you on the left, you can turn it off (O) until that gets fixed.

# Quest: Item Responder Chip
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000065b.name=Item Responder Chip
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000065b.desc=This chip also stores items in connected invetory. It designates a storage for items that are set in the filter of this chip. They do not actively request for items, they only serve as a destination for items to go. You can open up the menu by rightclicking the chip. There you can set which items should it accept and the priority. Items will go to item responders with higher priority first.

# Quest: Dynamic Item Responder
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000065d.name=Dynamic Item Responder
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000065d.desc=The dynamic item responder chip behaves exactly like an item responder chip, but instead of you setting up which items it should accept, it looks in the chest what items are there and those items it will accept.

# Quest: Item Overflow Chip
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000065c.name=Item Overflow Chip
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000065c.desc=This chip stores the items in a connected inventory. It designates a storage for items that have no other place to go. It is strongly recomended to have a default storage for items in every pipe system, otherwise bad stuff can happen. Best used with a large chest (diamond for example).%n%nIt seems to have some bugs though, so don't craft more than one without testing it first.%n%nYou might have to just use a normal item responder and add the items you want routed back to your overflow spot.

# Quest: Item Extractor Chip
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000065e.name=Item Extractor Chip
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000065e.desc=This chip will extract items from the connecting inventory. The extracted items then look for pipes with item responder chips where there's a free space they could go. If they don't find any they will go to the overflow default storage chest.%n%nIf you want it to extract everything leave the filter empty and set it to blacklist.

# Quest: Item Broadcaster
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000065f.name=Item Broadcaster
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000065f.desc=The item broadcaster is a chip that tells everything in the pipe system what items it has in the connecting inventory and if another chip needs anything it will send it to them. Right click it to set the items it will transmit. If you leave it empty and set to blacklist it will transmit everything.%n%nDefinitely use one in combination with an item overflow chip on your default storage chest. That way overflow will end up in the chest, but will be useable by the rest of your system.

# Quest: Item Stock Keeper Chip
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000660.name=Item Stock Keeper Chip
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000660.desc=The item stock keeper looks at the connecting inventory and keeps item stocked in there. If the item is missing it will keep bothering item broadcasters every few seconds if they have the item and if they can send it. It's basically like an annoying child. %n%nIt is really useful though. Want a chest that will always have 64 cobble and dirt in it and if you take them they will get replaced? This guy is perfect for that job. It's great for keeping machines stocked. When stocking GT machines, the top left slot of the 3x3 is equal to the left slot of the machine. Want a chemical reactor that keeps 3 hydrogen cells ready to go to make ammonia, just add nitrogen? This is the chip for you.

# Quest: Crafting Chip
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000661.name=Crafting Chip
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000661.desc=The crafting chip does exactly what it says. It's not just for default crafting. You can use it with GT machines. Just put in the matrix that it should insert and the output is what it should extract. A great use for them is in combination with fluid canners or super tanks for filling cells. I would strongly recommend not overusing them. Wait untill you have access to AE2 for autocrafting stuff.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000666.desc=Now let's automate electrolyzing water into oxygen and hydrogen. You'll need hydrogen for tons of stuff including desulfurization, obtaining tungsten, and nitric acid production. Oxygen is also useful as I'm sure you noticed when making steel.%n%nHow to set it up:%n%nPlace the electrolyzer down and connect it to water and electricity. Place the 2 super tanks nearby. Set the electrolyzer to produce hydrogen gas and oxygen cells. Use normal GT fluid pipes to output the hydrogen gas into one super tank. That is now your hydrogen storage. Now connect interface pipes to all 3 machines.%n%nFor the electrolyzer put in item stock keeper set to keep 2 empty cells stored. Also put in extractor set to extract oxygen cells.%n%nNow for the oxygen storage put it item responder chip set to accept oxygen cells and extractor set to extract empty cells.%n%nNow put some empty cells inside your default storage chest and don't forget to have a broadcaster there.

# Quest: Desulfurizing the Oil
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000667.name=Desulfurizing the Oil
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000667.desc=Now it's time to start the actual desulfurization. Use a chemical reactor of your choice, fill it with sulfuric light fuel and hook it to power. Now connect an interface pipe to it. Put an item stock keeper inside set to store 4 hydrogen cells. Then put in item extractor set to extract hydrogen sulfide and empty cells.%n%nGo to your hydrogen storage super tank and put in a crafting chip set to make one hydrogen cell from one empty cell.%n%nAnd that's all.

# Quest: Dealing with H2S
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000668.name=Dealing with H2S
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000668.desc=Now let's convert all that H2S into sulfuric acid. Hook up a chemical reactor to electricity, water and interface pipe. Put inside an item responder chip set to accept H2S cells and extract empty cells. Distill that diluted sulfuric acid in distillery and store it in super tank.%n%nCongratulations. You now have a completely automatic desulfuring of oil, automatic production of hydrogen and oxygen and you also store all that sulfuric acid.

# Quest: Reward for Desulfurizing Automation

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000006da.desc=100 Percent Waterproof.%n%nThe computer base is the HUB of all your computer parts essentially. It takes two memory sticks, a BIOs rom, a CPU, and a hard drive at the very least to run your computer.%n%nThe power converter allows you to power it from your GregTech power grid, and the floppy drive will allow you to install your operating system onto the hard drive. Both parts are essential but both for some strange reason requires the T2 microchips to craft; so I'll let you trade the materials+T1 Microchips for some. Don't lose them!

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000006e1.desc=First things first, let's install OpenOS to the computer so you don't always need disk in the drive. Type in 'install' and then type 'Y' when asked if you wish to install OpenOS.     %n%nWhen finished, remove the disk and toss it on your wall and reboot the computer.%n%nType 'df' to display all present file systems and mount points, you'll notice one named OpenOS; this is your hard drive's default name after installing the OS.%n%nLet's change it with 'label -a OpenOS HDD', '-a' checks for names starting with what you type after it with that command. §3<-- part of this is apparently wrong? Thanks for the non-ticket explaining what part, guys.§r%n%nNow for fun, let's make your first program! How about something functional, make a with 'edit startup' this will bring you to an edit page for a new program called startup. Let's just have it do something simple, 'print("Hello World!")' Like that'll never get old.%n%nNow press Ctrl+S to save, and Ctrl+W to get out of that screen. Back in your home root let's now type startup and you'll see it display "Hello World!"  neat huh?%n%nLet's now make startup actually work on startup. Type 'edit .shrc' .shrc is a mystic file that runs shell commands when booting your PC. So in .shrc type 'startup' save and reboot the computer. Now it should say "Hello World!" upon starting. Double neat right?

# Quest: Mounting Your HDD

When you start it, and you feel awesome and capable of world domination. %n%nNow lets setup your HDD. Open .shrc again in the editor, and press ENTER to go down a line after the print, and type in 'cd ../' this will move your viewed directory that's being viewed to the absolute base directory.  %n%nNow go down another line and type in 'mount HDD C:' because why not, it's Classic; this mounts the file drive into the folder you're in. Go down another line and type cd 'C:/' save and reboot the computer.%n%nYou'll now start in C:/ nifty! Try typing 'mkdir programs' and now you have a dedicated directory to put your programs in for the sake of organization.%n'cd programs' will then take you to programs, and 'cd ../' will take you back a directory; you can also do things like, lets say you have a folder called apples in C as well but you're in apples, type 'cd ../apples' and it'll take you to apples. '..' essentially just means previous directory and this can be stacked; works with copying files and moving them as well, very useful to know.  %n%nBut right now we're going to do something functional, come over to the next quest and bring your adapter and cables.

# Quest: Basic Power Display

What we're looking for is gt_batterybuffer.%nIf you have too many nearby things it may not display and the way to search the entire list of components is too advanced for starters.%n%nSo now assign a variable to it; for example 'a = component.gt_batterybuffer'; now we can call 'a' to see what methods the batteryBuffer has.%nWhat we'll be using in this example is the 'getBatteryCharge' method. So type  'a.getBatteryCharge(1)' this will call the method getBatteryCharge from the first inventory slot on the gt_batterybuffer in component.%n%nSo if we're using a 2x2 battery buffer; we can type something like, 'for i=1, 4 do print(a.getBatteryCharge(i)) end'%nPoof you now see what all the batteries EU values. Now what can we do with this?%n%nTry making a variable called 'batteryCharge = 0', now do 'for i=1, 4 do batteryCharge = batteryCharge + a.getBatteryCharge(i) end'%n%nNow print(batteryCharge) will display the total charge. Here's a program example of this being used.%n%nPlace in your tape drive and type 'install', and follow the promps to install it into C. Then edit it, test it, figure how it works.%n%nI suppose that's enough for now; congrats! Experiment and learn, and don't forget to check google as much as possible!  %nThis questline will be updated again in the future; but I figure this is a good ending point for now.

The interface resembles most GUI based automation systems like LabView.%n%nThere have been TPS problems caused by poorly designed SFM setups. Make sure your outputs are properly emptied, and don't get filled.%n%nInventory cables are the "basic" cable of SFM. They allow the MIM to interact with an inventory, and act as a connector cable to other cables.%n%nmehdi2344 thinks my jokes suck, but he's an idiot, so there. %n%nThanks to Nori Silverrage for writing up these quests!%n%n§3BTW, there's a Creative Supplier for creative testing.

There are two modes for pattern encoding. Crafting patterns, and processing patterns. Processing patterns are designed for use with machines that do not use standard crafting recipes - such as furnaces, or other machines. To select between modes, click the button to the right of the interface: when it shows a standard crafting table, it will create crafting patterns, and when it shows a furnace, it will create processing patterns.%n%nFor crafting patterns ("Crafts..."), you specify the input crafting materials on a standard 3x3 crafting grid, and the output materials are determined automatically.%n%nFor processing patterns ("Creates..."), you specify the input materials and output materials, including quantity, by placing stacks of items in the interface. If a processing operation is not guaranteed to succeed (such as secondary products from some machines), it will not work correctly as a processing pattern.%n%nWhen designing crafting patterns you can click the output to extract a crafted item as long as you have the materials required to craft the item.%nDon't forget to enable oredict substitution where needed.

You need to link a vis relay through the network to supply essentia to it, and a Knowledge Core with recipes on it for to work. Additionally, you can add vis discount gear into the interface to take advantage of the discount. The base discount starts at 20%%. For each Acceleration card, the time taken will reduce by 20%%, and increase power used by 50%%. For every point of warp on the discount gear, the power costs increase by 15%%.%n%nThe knowledge core holds up to 21 patterns for use in the Arcane Assembler, but you need a new assembler for every knowledge core if you want to autocraft more than that.%n%nTo encode the patterns, you need a Knowledge Inscriber.

For now, the basic ones will do, but eventually, you'll end up using dense cables and p2p channels. Glass and Covered cables are functionally identical, just different in looks. Each can carry 8 channels.  Quartz fibers don't carry channels but can carry energy. This is useful for providing power from your main network to independant subnetworks.%n%nYou can also color your cables - cables with different colors will not connect, so those can be used to expand network capacity by running parallel cables. Only fluix colored cables connect to all other colors. Later it will probably be more efficient to use P2P channels to jam a bunch of channels into 1.%n%nAnchors are like covers, keeping things from connecting when you don't want them to.

The pylons need to indicate the X, Y and Z dimensions, with you needing 1 more than you would think. If the efficiency goes below 100%%, the AE cost will balloon enormously, so add more pylons to counteract that. After using a redstone signal to activate the SIOP, the blocks will be moved to the spatial IO dim, and the drive will move to the output, so you can send it somewhere else. This is very important to do properly if you want to use it as a teleporter. Otherwise you can get stuck there. Your network will need to be able to hold all the power needed to teleport at once, so you'll need at least one energy cell. You can only have one Pylon setup per controller, so consider putting them on a subnetwork.%n%nUsing 2 in the X and Z dimensions and 3 in the Y will give you a 1x2x1 teleporter to teleport yourself. You'll want a SIOP port on each side for sending and for receiving.

NO WAY! %nAnyway, while you can listen to those who swear flasks are *the shit* and *the only way* you can automate fluid crafting and the AL, you can use this powerful addon backported by GlodBlock with some help by other devs.%n%nNow, what do you need to get that juicy stuff working?%nEvery ME System needs a Fluid Discretizer. It allows for on demand crafting. While you can use AE2FC without Fluid Discretizer for moving fluids, you need a Discretizer for autocrafting.%n%nThen you also need a fluid terminal or a fluid processing terminal for assembly line. %n%nWhen creating patterns you will notice your fluids being placed as if they were items. %nYour finished patterns will look blue-ish. Placing those in a Dual Interface will allow AE2 to push the fluids and items both. Note. Fluids are being sent first, then items.%nYou can switch the dual interface on the top right if you want it to keep fluids in stock. %n%nIf you use a blue pattern (fluid pattern) in a normal interface, AE2 will send the fluid as a fluid packet. This is just a representation of the fluid as an item. A fluid decoder can turn it back into a fluid and saves it in the fluid grid.%n%nYou can use an ingredient buffer (large or normal) so your items and fluids sent by a pattern can get stored internally in one block. The normal buffer can hold 9 items and 4 fluids whereas the large one can hold 27 items and 7 fluids.%nYou can use it to automate multiblocks with e.g item and fluid conduits. %n%nIf you want to automate single blocks its as easy as eating chocolate cake while on your diet:%nMake the pattern, make an interface, boom- done!%nIt will automatically insert the fluid in the fluid inventory of a single block machine. %n%nAutomating the Assembling Line is easy. It follows the typical flask setup but replaces tanks with fluid decoders and a fluid storage bus to insert the fluids. Also we are sending fluids first, then items by using the priority button (made by Runakai and Rukern) in the fluid processing terminal. Make sure to give the decoders their own subnets in ME. If you need more detailled information, visit the wiki:%n%nhttps://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/AE2FC%n%n§3The Extra Cells mod is now deprecated.

# Quest: 1k Essentia Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000009c5.name=1k Essentia Storage Cell
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000009c5.desc=Unlike the item version, these can only hold 12 types of essentia each. This tier holds 2,048 units if you fill it with a single type of essentia. If you fill it with 12 different types of essentia, you can have about 168 units of each. If you want one for every type of essentia, you'll need 67 of them. You'll want to make the essentia terminal to see what you have. They consume the same amount of AE as the item ones.

# Quest: Deck of Cards
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000009eb.name=Deck of Cards
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000009eb.desc=These cards add additional functionality to certain devices or fixtures. They specify what devices they work on in the tooltip.%n%nThe Redstone Card adds redstone interactivity to the devices it can be used on, with the following options:%nAlways active, active with or without redstone signal, activate once per pulse.%n%nThe Capacity Card adds more slots for items that use them. If you add this to an Export Bus, an icon is added to select item priority.%n%nThe Crafting Card allows you to automatically request autocrafting of items.%nIn an ME Interface, if you put in items to be stocked, if there aren't enough, it'll craft them until it reaches the selected amount. Remember that these are being stocked for crafting recipes that the ME Interface has. If you want them to be seen by the network, you'll need to put a storage bus on the ME Interface.%n%nIn an ME Level Emitter, in the first mode, it'll emit a redstone signal while the specific item is being crafted. In the second, it will emit a redstone signal once a crafting job for the item has been requested, but§4§r §4it won't send the items to be crafted.§r This is useful if you're using a dummy pattern, and are using the level emitter to tell something else to happen. You still need to get the item(s) requested back into the system so it doesn't tie up a crafting CPU though.%n%nIn an ME Export Bus, it'll attempt to send whatever item(s) are selected in the export bus' GUI. In the first mode, it'll send available items first, then create crafting jobs for the rest. In the second mode, it will only send crafted items.%n%nThe Acceleration Card makes the device/fixture work faster. You'll probably want a lot of these.%n%nThe Inverter Card allows you to invert the item filter of certain fixtures.%n%nThe Fuzzy Card allows you to apply fuzzy logic to filtering to allow items with different NBT or damage data to be counted as the same. This is different from metadata. If you just want it to be fuzzy for nbt, set to Match Any. If it is set to 99%%, it will work on anything that is damaged. You can use the Inverter Card to reverse this.

# Quest: Gotta Find Them All

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000b3.desc=There are a lot of meteors on the surface, but there are more underground. In order to find those, you'll want a compass. The compass will only tell you the chunk has an asteroid in it, with your ore finder wand you can get a better idea where in the chunk the meteor is hiding.%n%nFor more details on AE2, check out https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-AE2

# Quest: Miscellaneous AE Items
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000009f4.name=Miscellaneous AE Items
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000009f4.desc=There are several AE items that aren't particularly useful, but probably deserve mention, so here they are:%n%nCertus Tanks: They hold 32B and are portable and easy to make.%n%nView Cell: Format in a Cell Workbench to filter what you see in a terminal (when they're installed in it)%n%nCertus/Nether Quartz Cutting Knifes: Right-click to open interface. Place an iron ingot in the slot, and choose a name. The press can be used in the Inscriber to name stuff without using an anvil. You can also rename p2p tunnels and interfaces in world with the knife.%n%nME Block Container: Holds only one type of item, but the amount of a 64k drive. Can place the item in world, or replace in a 1x1 or 3x3 area. Blocks replaced will be dumped in world. This will be horizontal or vertical depending on which side of a block you select. Shift-right click air to change mode, right click a block to activate mode.%n%nCharged Quartz Fixture: Emits light at the same level as a torch, but fancier.%n%nLight Detecting Fixture: Emits redstone signal based on light. Since it only starts at 7, it's not as useful as the Light Sensor.%n%nME Upgrade (Tier 1/2/3): If you're an OC person, there's 3 upgrades you can make to add access to your network from robots and drones.%nT1: 0.5 access point range%nT2: Normal access point range%nT3: Unlimited range, any dim%n%nEntropy Manipulator: Changes grass/dirt/dried dirt into each other, or starts fires. Or melts ice. Useless.%n%nMatter Cannon: Shoots Matter Balls made in the Matter Condensor. Put it in an ME Chest or Drive and put items in a Terminal to fill. Decent I guess? But it destroys blocks every time you use it, so... Well, I guess you could use it with Paint Balls?%n%nColor Applicator: Use dye items or Paint Balls (more efficient) to dye stuff. You can dye cables, or anything Forge-compatible, like wool or glass. Place items inside like the Matter Cannon. You can cycle through the colors by holding shift and right-clicking, or scrolling the mouse wheel. If you use snow balls, you can remove paint instead. You can also use it in a dispensor.%n%nWalrus: It's a walrus, what were you expecting?

# Quest: Basic AE2 System
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ac1.name=Basic AE2 System
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ac1.desc=So you've unlocked AE2, but don't know how to use it? Not to worry, that's what this questline is for. For a basic (and not completely useless) ME system, make the items on the right first. After you go through the quests to get them normally of course.%n%n§3You could technically make one with an ME Chest, but there'd be no advantage over using a regular chest.§r%n%nConnect power to the Energy Acceptor, place the ME Drive next to it, place a Fluix Cable on top of the ME Drive connect the ME Terminal to the cable. Just put in the Storage cells, and you're done! Remember you need a Network Tool to see how much power it actually uses. Also, it lets you pick up stuff easier.%n%nTo save power, let's do a little extra work. Place the Pressure Plate two spaces in front of the ME Terminal, place redstone next to it and beside the Energy Acceptor. Remove the EA and place a Fluix Cable there, and then place the ME Toggle Bus between the Drive and where the Energy Acceptor will be. Then plunk that back down and re-power it. This will cause it to only connect (and thus use power) when you stand on the plate. This tiny network uses about 38 EU by itself, so you should understand that an ME system is not cheap either in materials or power.

# Quest: External Storage
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ac2.name=External Storage
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ac2.desc=Drawers are great, right? Well, let's connect your ME system to a bank of them. Set up some drawers nearby with a controller attached. Then place an ME Storage Bus against the controller and set the priority to +1. This will prioritize I/O to the drawer controller. Lock your drawers before they fill with random stuff. Now you have access to the whole thing! Great for the results of mining, and anything else you have thousands of, while keeping your ME system relatively empty.%n%nYou can also connect to chests and other things if you want. You can use an Ender Chest to send stuff into your network, which will then send it to the drawers, but you'll have stuff entering and exiting constantly, so it'll mess up your view in the Terminal. You can use filtered view cells, or process them before they go into your ME network (or in a different one) and/or send them to the DC directly via another EC. It depends on what you want to do and what it is.%n%n§4Using the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will tank TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted or you getting banned.

# Quest: Autocrafting
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ac3.name=Autocrafting
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ac3.desc=This is the main purpose of AE2, so let's get to it. Plunk down the Crafting Storage and Molecular Assembler, connect the Pattern Terminal to a cable, and attach the ME Interface to the MA (make sure it has power from another side). You could run it without a ME Interface, but you can only do one recipe then. Place a Blank Pattern in the Pattern Terminal, and add the recipe for a Crafting Table, then click the arrow to save it to the pattern. Put this in the ME Interface and you can now request a craft of it. (if the items are in the network, otherwise it'll fail obviously)%n%nFor processing patterns (machines, anything not regular 3x3 crafting) click the button on the right. You'll need to specify all I/O for it yourself. You can use this on an ME Interface on a furnace (for example), combined with an ME Import Bus to collect the results. If it's a machine that auto-ejects (like multis) you can use a ME Interface to collect the results much faster (and with less lag).

# Quest: P2P
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ac4.name=P2P
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ac4.desc=One of the more complicated parts of AE2, you'll need to understand this to really get anywhere with the mod. First, replace your EA with an ME Controller. Now you have a bunch more channels to work with. Place the P2P Bus against one of the sides and then connect some cables to it to a place a bit away. Make sure to send power to this cable with an EA or Quartz Fiber, but NOT a normal cable, this is now a separate network, and that would cancel that. Connect the second P2P Bus to the other end, and then place at least 1 Dense Cable coming off of it. Shift-right click your 1st P2P Bus, then Right click the 2nd. They're now connected, and there are 2 channels being used on your subnetwork, while you have the full 32 from the side of your Controller to use. For each subnetwork that doesn't have an ME Controller, you can send 4 sides, or 128 channels. I'm sure you can understand how useful this is, right?%n%nThere's lots more to understand about AE2, but you should probably either experiment, read the quests, or watch a video for more than the basics.%n%nAlso keep in mind that EC2 is kinda completely broken in regards to fluids, so maybe avoid that. (The questmaker is sad :()


## Quest Line: How to Be(e)
betterquesting.questline.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000014.name=How to Be(e)

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001f4.desc=As usual. In order to get started with bees, you need a few basic things. Most importantly... a scoop. For this quest you want to make a GregTech scoop. Later you can make scoops using magic or even rechargeable scoops.

# Quest: Go Find Some Bees
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001f5.name=Go Find Some Bees
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001f5.desc=The next thing to do: Find a few bee hives around the world. There are 11 mundane bees that can be found, of which 8 are located in the Overworld. Any kind of bee will work for this quest.

# Quest: Frames
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000458.name=Frames
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000458.desc=Untreated frames are the simplest frames. They do not work in bee houses, only in apiaries or alvearies. You will need them to craft bee houses.%n%nThey increase the bee's performance. Each untreated frame will double a bee's productivity.

# Quest: A New Home
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001f6.name=A New Home
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001f6.desc=Now that you've destroyed the poor bees' homes, you should build them a new one. The humble Bee House will not let your bees mutate into new species. But you'll need the combs anyways for better housing. The production rate isn't too bad, but they cannot be automated.%n%nOne tip - Put some vanilla saplings near the Bee Houses. Bee Houses give a natural boost of 3x to pollination vs better housing. The bees will pollinate them and you might get lucky and start getting some Forestry tree crossbreeding. Stick with Oak and Birch trees, they'll give you a nice mix of starter Forestry trees.%n%nOf course, if you do this without taking precautions, you may find yourself swarmed by laggy butterflies...%n%nYou may also notice that bees with the 'flower' type flower spread flowers. This can be used to get, say, lavender, among others. If you don't like them spreading them everywhere, replace the dirt/grass blocks, remove the trait, or reduce the pollination speed/territory.

# Quest: Analyze Them All
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001f7.name=Analyze Them All
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001f7.desc=Every bee has multiple properties that define what the bee does, how it behaves in rain or at night, and a couple of other aspects. It is mandatory to keep track of those properties. This kit isn't very good since it doesn't give you information on their Inactive attributes, but waste not, want not.%n%nYou'll need to use paper to analyze each bee.

# Quest: To Scan or Not to Scan
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001f8.name=To Scan or Not to Scan
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001f8.desc=In order to get into bee breeding, you need a way to see all the traits, active and inactive. You only want to breed so called "pure" bees; For those, both "Active" and "Inactive" traits are identical.%n%n§3BTW, it's not like the more 'advanced' versions are actually better, just that they have more functions. Use the one you like.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000003e0.desc=Next you'll need to find some tropical bees. The hives can be found in Jungle biomes. Be careful as these bees are very aggressive and can poison you. Collect the silky combs and extract some silk wisp from those in order to make some Apiarist's clothes. Try to get pristine bees. If you're having trouble finding them, you can use Nature's Compass to search for a specific biome.

# Quest: Silky Combs and Propoli

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000459.desc=Impregnated Frames are even better than untreated Frames. %nEach frame doubles the bee's productivity. It has a longer durability than the untreated frame, but a shorter one compared to the proven frame.

# Quest: Upgraded Home
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001fb.name=Upgraded Home
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001fb.desc=The Bee House can be used to stabilize mutations, for example if you have successfully bred two different bees, but the passive traits are different from the active ones. %n%nTo actually breed those together to get a new species, you'll need something different - the Apiary. Building them will require a Carpenter and Impregnated frames, along with Seed Oil and Creosote - quite a bit of industrialization! Or, if you're lucky, you can find a beekeeper villager to trade with. Maybe you can help the villagers §lget lucky§r to make more beekeeper villagers? If only Cupid and his bow were around...%n%nProduction rates in an empty Apiary are low - lower than a Bee House by quite a bit, in fact.  But the Apiary has two big advantages - Frames, and Automation. You can now use your Untreated or Impregnated frames in here to boost output - and the boost is multiplied. So 3 x2 frames gives you 2 * 2 * 2 = 8x extra output! You can also automate I/O for the bees and their products, though not frames unfortunately.%n%nBees also don't live as long as in a Bee House, but that's actually a good thing.%n%nAlso, you should check the Genetics mod for useful machines. The Acclimatiser can give very picky bees a much wider temperature or humidity tolerance without having to breed it into them.

The alveary allows for combs to be produced faster due to its natural speed increase to production (as well as the ability to add up to six frames via the Extra Bees frame housings) and due to its ability to be modified by other blocks. %n%nIt is possible to adjust the internal temperature of the alveary using the alveary heater or alveary fan in order to accommodate bees that require hotter or colder climates.%n%nCertain bees will not produce their specialty items unless they are Jubilant. This requires matching their preferred Temperature/Humidity, without any genetic modifiers. Some bees also need a block of something beneath them as well.%n%nIt is also possible to use mutators to increase chances of mutation, alveary lighting and alveary rain shield to allow bees without the nocturnal and tolerant flyer traits to work during the night and rain, respectively, and the swarmer to use excess royal jelly to create princesses that last for a limited number of generations.%n%n§3If you're mutating bees that need a specific block in it, you need to place the required block under the middle bottom, and have the one directly above be a normal alveary block.

If you can't find a beekeeper, there are couple of different options to get one. Rescue a zombie villager, add doors to a village to get them to make kids, or perhaps use a cupid's bow and arrow...%n%nAbout magic frames:%nThey're the core of magically endowed frames. They also have a special ability - no maximum production chance. Normal frames are ineffective to get above 16x production (4 frames) but with magic frames you can keep going - just watch out, above 16x you'll be working your bees so hard they have a chance to degenerate into ignoble ones. This can happen any bee tick, not just when they die. Frames to lower genetic decay will lower the chances of this happening.%n%nOf course, with very long lifespans, high production genes, swarmers, and tons of frames, you may think this is worth it.%n%nNote that normal products have a cap of 200%% produced, and specialties 100%%.

# Quest: Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008a1.name=Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008a1.desc=First off, don't be scared by the massive amounts of bees you see here once you unlock the breeding trees. There's even more that aren't included and you'll need NEI to find!%n%nHa ha, just kidding - don't panic! Once you unlock the bee breeding lines, look around and pick and choose which bees really interest you. The way the breeding is done is mostly left to right, and top down. Some of the lines at the bottom might look simple, but they will require bees further up to complete first. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown here.%n%nBees have two sets of traits, one that is §aActive§r that has effects on how the bee lives, and one §3Inactive§r but can be used for breeding. Some traits are §4Dominant§r, and some are §9Recessive§r. Keep this in mind when trying to breed in or out a new trait. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the targeted bee traits. You can breed the bees with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. You can't see the passive traits using a Field Kit, you'll need a Beealyzer. For lots of bees, you can scan them first using a GT scanner, but you'll still need a Beealyzer to see passive traits.%n%nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee.  A bee that has little or no crossbreeding potential, but has all the traits you prefer - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility, etc.  Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.%n%nWhen you are trying for a new bee, what you are wanting is a drone - this way you can use your "breeding stock" princess for easy breeding, but the drone to get the new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poor crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good for this, since they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let them live longer. Once you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die (they can become ignoble under certain circumstances though, like using tons of production frames). Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits already, and there's a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect them with that.%n%nOnce you get a new species, it will replace all of one of the two sets of traits of the bee. §3If you get the mutation chance success twice on the same bee, it'll replace both active and inactive sets of traits though.§r For example when you get a Cultivated, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated! All the quests will require §6purebred§r species. PS: most effects are useless, so don't worry too much.%n%nAll traits can be bred into any bee species, aside from the species itself. Species also determines the preferred temperature and humidity, as well as drops. Species will require their preferred temerature and humidity to be in 'jubilant' state, and produce their special drops. You can also mimic this with the alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT with tolerances.%n%nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances, or to lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for that pristine princess to become ignoble!%n%nIt looks complex, because it is! But it's also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!

# Quest: Basic Bee Stats
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008a3.name=Basic Bee Stats
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008a3.desc=There are a couple of basic bees that have good stats you will want to breed into your breeding stock.%n%nCave Dwelling - Rocky - This lets you put the bee housing underneath or inside. Handy for putting a chest on top for products.%n%nNocturnal - Rocky - This keeps your bees working all night long, and in the dark.%n%nRain Tolerant - Water - Keep producing even when it is raining.%n%nHigh Fertility - Wintry - For breeding purposes, you want the maximum number of drones produced.%n%nReminder - Specialty products from bees require Jubilant state. That means the bee is in its §lNATURAL§r preferred climate. So it must not be in a biome it can tolerate due to temp/humidity improvements. For example, a Salt bee needs Warm/Normal climate. Even if it has +- humidity and temp, it will not produce its Salt comb unless it is in a Warm/Normal climate. Use Alveary upgrades to make sure it is in its preferred temp/humidity.

During the ride, if another pearl with this effect is thrown, the previous pearl will destroy itself and deal fall damage (unless No fall damage effect is applied).%n%nTrivia:%nThe Enhanced Ender Pearls can still be used for crafting an Eye of Ender.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000e9.desc=Now that you've found all six types of infused stone, you need to break those up in order to get the shards. The easiest way to do that, is to throw these stones in your Forge Hammer. Later when you have a Sifter, you can sift purified ores for more shards. An autoclave can turn shard dust into a shard. Maybe there's a magical way to do the same thing?

# Quest: Balanced Shards sdrahS decnalaB
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000f2.name=Balanced Shards sdrahS decnalaB
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000f2.desc=By combining all six primal aspects in a crucible, you are able to make balanced shards. They can be ground up into "Salis Mundus", an absolutely crucial thing to have, trust me!

# Quest: Crystal Clusters
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000f3.name=Crystal Clusters
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000f3.desc=You, as a Thaumaturge, like shiny things. And what could be more shiny than a cluster made of those shards? You totally should get one of each.

# Quest: Not Just For Decoration
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000fb.name=Not Just For Decoration
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000fb.desc=Sure, they look pretty, but they serve a much more important purpose: Channeling vast amounts of vis and essentia. Your first uses will be an infusion setup and an alchemical furnace.

# Quest: Yet Another Brick in the Wall...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ef.name=Yet Another Brick in the Wall...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ef.desc=A magical one this time. You're on your way to infusion which needs 8 of these. Another 4 will be needed for the alchemical furnace.%n%n§3Yes, you need an MV PLE, deal with it.

# Quest: Tome of Knowledge
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000e7.name=Tome of Knowledge
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000e7.desc=All the things you've discovered so far, you need to write them down. But you're lazy, and you have a wand, so why not try a magical way to "write down" your research? You wonder if you could enchant a book with your wand, so that it will keep track of your progress... You should try that on a bookshelf!

# Quest: Warp Warnings
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000006f2.name=Warp Warnings
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000006f2.desc=Thaumcraft offers considerable power from its devices and tools. But power comes with a price.... That price is represented by Warp: A corruption of the character's mind and soul, inflicting progressively more dire effects upon them. %n%nWhile the effects of warp can range from annoying to deadly, accumulating enough of it can also grant you access to greater power... at the cost of increasing madness, and attention from dark powers. At least, others may call it madness... but is it truly insanity, when the voices in your head grant useful knowledge?%n%nWarp Theory adds a bunch of new Warp Effects to the Player. Be very careful because you don't want to spawn a Wither in your base.%n%n5 warp: Message%n10 warp: Fake Explosion%n15 warp: Coin, Pumpkin%n20 warp: Lay Eggs, Spawn Phantoms%n25 warp: Fake Creeper, Fake Rain%n30 warp: GregTech Fake Sounds, Spawn Bats%n35 warp: Blood, Fake Enderman%n40 warp: Spawn Friendly Creeper%n45 warp: Jump Boost, Nausea%n50 warp: Insomnia, Vis Drain%n55 warp: Thunderstorm%n60 warp: Spawn Fire Bats%n65 warp: Blindness, Poison%n70 warp: Livestock Rain%n75 warp: Spawn Doppelganger%n80 warp: Spawn Endermen, Wither Potion%n85 warp: Wind%n90 warp: Ender Pearl%n95 warp: Blaze Fireball%n100 warp: Litmus Paper, Junk%n110 warp: Obsidian%n120 warp: Lightning%n125 warp: Inventory Swap%n130 warp: Random Teleport%n140 warp: Acceleration%n150 warp: Fake Wither, Inventory Scramble%n160 warp: Countdown Bomb%n170 warp: Mushrooms%n175 warp: Snow%n180 warp: Decay%n190 warp: Swamp%n200 warp: Spawn Wither

# Quest: See the Unseen
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000e2.name=See the Unseen
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000e2.desc=Everything is made of 6 primal aspects. Those aspects can be combined to form compound aspects, but in the end, there are only 6, kinda like the infused shards you found. You noticed that those shards start to vibrate when you bring them next to something that is made of the respective aspect. Maybe you can create a device to actually "scan" items, and reveal their compounds? This could be very useful later on.

# Quest: Just Tell Me What to Scan Already!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005b5.name=Just Tell Me What to Scan Already!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005b5.desc=Don't want to guess at what has what aspect? Just want to get to work? Then scan this stuff. The first set should be scanned in order.

# Quest: Scribing Tool
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000448.name=Scribing Tool
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000448.desc=To unlock research you need a scribing tool and paper. To do the research, you need a scribing tool and the research note you made in the research table, so you should probably make two tools.%n%nNote: Thaumcraft Research Tweaks has reworked the research table GUI. Aspects are now combined with drag & drop between aspects in the GUI. You can also right-click while dragging the aspect instead of dropping; the same works with the hexes. All the new features are described in your Thaumonomicon, make sure to checkout the 'Research', 'Research Expertise', 'Research Mastery' and 'Research Duplication' pages.

# Quest: A Table to Work On
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000e3.name=A Table to Work On
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000e3.desc=Now you need something on which to craft magical items. It probably needs to be a little magical itself. Let's see what the book says.%n%n§3I should probably take this time to read all the stuff in the Thaumonomicon I don't know about while I'm at it, instead of posting on Discord and looking stupid.

# Quest: Blub Blub Blub.....
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000452.name=Blub Blub Blub.....
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000452.desc=The brewing stand is really important for brewing the various potions like night vision, healing, haste and jump. Toxic potions or splash potions can be created too. You'll also need it to make a brewery.%n%nWith your basic wand you can finally create one. The recipes can be found on the GTNH page in the Thaumonomicon.

# Quest: The Night's Not Dark Anymore
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000061d.name=The Night's Not Dark Anymore
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000061d.desc=Hardcore darkness is a pain, but now the night will be bright. Or at least, your perception will be that it is, mobs can still spawn! Be careful, the mobs aren't any weaker.%n%n§3BTW, you can make a longer laster potion out of this one. Also, you should probably make them in batches of 3 so you don't waste materials.

# Quest: Greedy Chest
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000802.name=Greedy Chest
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000802.desc=The Greedy Chest from Automagy looks to have some interesting uses. It also gates a pretty important device for a magician...

# Quest: So Thirsty 
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000007fa.name=So Thirsty 
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000007fa.desc=Just listening to this tank gulp water makes me thirsty. If placed next to a water source block, it is a decent water source. It also supports several upgrades to speed and capacity. Try out this glyph near your cows, and get a tank full of milk for all your cheese and butter needs.

# Quest: An Alternative to Torches
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ff.name=An Alternative to Torches
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ff.desc=And lava! It's an excellent magical light source. You can use it under your crucible, too! But not your witchery stuff. :(

# Quest: Essentia Cooking
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000f0.name=Essentia Cooking
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000f0.desc=In order to get essentia, you need to dissolve items. Obviously, you only want to dissolve those items you don't really need, and only those with essentia you need to craft things.%n%nMake sure you keep your furnace as empty as possible. If it fills up with essentia, it can cause a large TPS drop.

# Quest: Turning Liquids Into Essentia
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000fd.name=Turning Liquids Into Essentia
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000fd.desc=What a simple idea. So many people waste tons of buckets just to get aqua from water, or sano from milk. Why didn't they just dissolve the liquid itself? Idiots...

# Quest: Not Coal
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000100.name=Not Coal
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000100.desc=Way better. More than Lignite even. It even speeds up the dissolving of items in an alchemical furnace.

# Quest: Enchanting Table 1.0
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000044c.name=Enchanting Table 1.0
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000044c.desc=Finally, with your new wand with 50 stored vis you're able to build your own enchantment table. The recipe can be found on the GTNH Tab in the Thaumonomicon.

# Quest: Division Sigil
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000044d.name=Division Sigil
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000044d.desc=Find a sigil in a chest? Get one from the Wither? You've heard about a ritual to activate it.%n%nYou need an enchantment table, 8 redstone dust, a weapon, and an animal you want to sacrifice. Catching and holding it with a Golden Lasso would be the easiest way. Check in LV for the Golden Lasso quest if you haven't completed it yet.%n%nPlace your enchantment table on a grass field and surround it with redstone dust. At midnight, place the animal on or near the table and kill it. You can check with the sigil if it's time yet by right-clicking it on the enchantment table. Of course you also need to have your sigil on you.%n%nBeware! Your actions will have consequences.

# Quest: Silky Jewel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000450.name=Silky Jewel
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000450.desc=Silky jewels add silk touch to your tinkers tool. They're kinda, well, useless for the most part, as ores like coal drop as themselves with GT oregen. Still, you can use it to get some cursed earth, or grass blocks if you want.%n%nThe recipe can be found on the GTNH page after researching the enchantment table.

# Quest: Cursed Earth
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000044f.name=Cursed Earth
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000044f.desc=You can kill the powered-up monsters that spawn on the cursed earth, or just sleep and despawn them. Use a shovel with the silk touch enchantment to dig up the cursed earth blocks. You can use these blocks to make a mob spawner, or place one under a vanilla spawner to let it run even when you're not around.%n%nWhen setting up a mob spawner in the Nether using Cursed Earth, poor design can cause huge TPS issues.%n%nMake sure the Cursed Earth is not attached to anything from the Nether. For example, you can place it on top of marble, but the marble cannot touch anything in the nether (netherrack, brick, etc), and must be floating in the air. Also, limit the Cursed Earth to 1 chunk max, with 2 block buffer to the chunk edge, including a wall.

# Quest: Where'd I Put That Amber?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000559.name=Where'd I Put That Amber?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000559.desc=Every Thaumcraft Infused Stone vein has a bit of amber ore in it. I'm sure you have a bunch by now.%n%n§3BTW, GT tools made of amber have silk touch, if you wanted that for something, hint, hint.

# Quest: Light It Up!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000055a.name=Light It Up!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000055a.desc=The arcane lamp creates additional light sources which acts like a Torch in a sphere with a radius of 16 blocks centered on it. This will include caves or other areas behind walls. That might be useful... One downside, it might put a light where one isn't wanted, like inside an EBF. %n%nWhen attached to the base of an arcane bore, the arcane lamp gains an additional ability: It will light up the tunnel that the bore digs.

# Quest: Essentia Filtering
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000fe.name=Essentia Filtering
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000fe.desc=This nifty little device will filter essentia out of an Alchemical Crucible or Alchemical Boiler. Once it has received a single unit of any type, it will only accept this type until it is completely empty. You can place more than one on top of an alchemical furnace, and you should. Try to have one per essentia type in the item you're melting on a furnace.%n%nYou should lock the type with a Label, or every time it fills again, it's likely to be a different type, and gum up your pipes.

# Quest: It's Called the Thaumatorium, OK?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b46.name=It's Called the Thaumatorium, OK?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b46.desc=This device will allow automating the crucible. Check the research to the far right of the crucible for details.

# Quest: Improving Your Wand
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000e8.name=Improving Your Wand
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000e8.desc=Your wand does a great job in storing and releasing vis as you please. However, those iron caps are... §oweak§r. If you don't pay enough attention to it, it might hurt the node. They also make crafting harder. Maybe you should try to improve it with caps made out of a more valuable material. Like... gold, perhaps?

# Quest: A "Greater" Wand
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ea.name=A "Greater" Wand
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ea.desc=While doing all your research and mining of these infused stones, you had an idea how to use the wood of a Greatwood tree to make a new wand. Actually, it turned out to be pretty simple, but you lacked one important thing back then: vis! The vis makes sure the wood doesn't lose it's magical conductivity while forming the rod.

# Quest: Better Screws
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000eb.name=Better Screws
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000eb.desc=Unfortunately, your aluminium screws don't work with the greatwood rod. Somehow, the wood seems to repel the material. Luckily, you already have a blast furnace, so you can get a better material than aluminium.

# Quest: A More Powerful "Scale"
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ec.name=A More Powerful "Scale"
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ec.desc=The naga scales are weak, they can only hold a very limited amount of vis. You need a better, more powerful component to store vis in your wand. You've heard rumors about an evil wizard in the Twilight Forest. Maybe he has... something... that can be used?

# Quest: Iron Capped Greatwood Wand
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000031e.name=Iron Capped Greatwood Wand
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000031e.desc=Making a gold capped greatwood wand requires 30 vis, but your old wand's limit is 25. So first create an iron or copper capped greatwood wand reload it with 50 vis and then later on in the next quest create a gold capped greatwood wand.%n%n§3You can always press the NEI 'U' command on the caps, the core, or the boss ingredient to find the correct GT:NH recipe for the wands.

# Quest: "Stores 50 Vis" Wand
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ed.name="Stores 50 Vis" Wand
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ed.desc=With gold caps you avoid the downsides of iron. So best to upgrade to a Gold Banded Greatwood Wand!%n%nWith this you are more powerful than ever! You have a feeling that this new wand will come in handy very soon.%n%n§3Going forward the wand quests will not focus on caps. You now know that wands with iron caps are the cheapest to make, but gold caps are better. You should also explore what other caps exist, they might be even better!%nIron caps being the cheapest however does not mean that you always need to start with an iron cap wand, only to make a better one. Instead, you should be starting to stack crafting discounts from various sources! If you don't have at least 10%% discount on your gear right now, you should probably look around this questtab to improve on that.

# Quest: I Can See Everything
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000007ce.name=I Can See Everything
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000007ce.desc=With your new wand, you can make Goggles of Revealing. You can now see nodes clearly, more so than with the thaumometer, but all the time! Additionally, the goggles give you a 5 percent vis discount.%n%nSimple lens upgrades will grant you various seeing abilities as well.%n%nLater you can make more advanced goggles and even integrate the goggles into advanced armors.%n%nWith TC Node Tracker, it makes remembering nodes trivial. The default key is I. You can select from the list of nodes you have scanned, and an in-world arrow will show you the way. You can also sort the list.

# Quest: Everything Fuzzy? Try Some Lenses
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000813.name=Everything Fuzzy? Try Some Lenses
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000813.desc=Now that you have Goggles of Revealing, Thaumic Horizons offers various lenses with handy uses. This one will grant night vision. Try out some of the others.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b45.desc=If you take a little dip into the dark side, you can make these goggles. They give the best discount until you can make infinity armor. And who even does that?%n%nYou'll need infusion and some warping research first.%n%nIf you're a §oscaredy-cat§r you can make the Electric goggles on the armor tab instead.

# Quest: Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ee.name=Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000ee.desc=Your arcane table does a great job with infusing primal vis into items while crafting. However, you feel that there must be more. What if you could infuse items with all kinds of magic aspects? The possibilities are endless...

# Quest: The Choice...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000f5.name=The Choice...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000f5.desc=By now, you should've collected a few (or a lot) of locations for aura nodes to get vis from. You might also have noticed that you're probably low on a certain aspect, like ordo or ignis. Well, good news. In exchange for some crystal clusters, I will give you one of my old nodes. They're all pale, but they'll still help you out. You may only choose one, so think twice before you make your decision.

# Quest: The Choice: Aer

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000377.desc=Join the core with two wand caps, a twilight forest mob drop, and screws just as for making a wand. A staff cannot be used for crafting, but holds 2.5x as much vis as a corresponding wand. It can even serve as a backup weapon for melee. While it cannot receive weapon enchantments, its damage is decent, and it does not take damage with use (no durability bar).

# Quest: Magic "Staffter"
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000004a7.name=Magic "Staffter"
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000004a7.desc=It is also possible to create a bizarre hybrid of staff and scepter (sometimes called a "staffter"), by using a staff core instead of a wand core in the scepter recipe. The resulting device can neither hold a focus nor be placed in a crafting table, but it can still be used to activate constructs, or as a "vis battery" for Repair-enchanted equipment or Runic shielding.

# Quest: Disenchanted 
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000814.name=Disenchanted 
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000814.desc=If you found an item or book with a good enchantment - but also a bunch of garbage, you can strip the enchantments into separate books using a Disenchanter. Surround it with bookcases to reduce damage done to the item.

# Quest: Who Needs Friends?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008dc.name=Who Needs Friends?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008dc.desc=Luggage is better than a dumb old traveling trunk. It automatically picks up dropped items, saving you time while mining. It's near-invulnerable, including in lava. It will follow you like an eager puppy, to the ends of the earth - but you probably should pick her up before changing dimensions. A lightning strike can provide more room. Shift right-clicking will turn it back into an item without losing its contents. Look for her in the GTNH tab of the Thaumonomicon.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000036d.name=Scepter With 75 Vis Capacity
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000036d.desc=A scepter is crafted from a wand core, a primal charm, three wand caps, a twilight forest monster mob drop, and some screws. Any sort of core or cap may be used, but the caps must match each other. A scepter cannot hold a focus, but holds 150 percent as much vis as a wand with the same core, and gives an additional 10 percent discount for costs, beyond any discounts from its caps or the user's worn equipment. 

# Quest: Fool's Gold
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000096b.name=Fool's Gold
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000096b.desc=After holding a Primal Charm for a while, you suddenly understand some of it's whispers! It tells of a land filled with untold riches, just waiting for someone to claim them. You scoff at the claim, but apparently if you "Open the Eye" and create a very fancy carved stone, you can create a portal there. But this eye it speaks of...just what is it? Maybe by delving into the darker realm of magic...bah! Only fools would believe such nonsense.

# Quest: Best Wand Caps Ever
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000110.name=Best Wand Caps Ever

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000127.desc=Sure, you could just go with gazillions of jars, but it's way more convenient to store essentia in a chest or barrel. Isn't it?

# Quest: The Basic Elements

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000012b.desc=Manually checking your jars can be tedious, especially if you want to infuse a bunch of stuff at once. Luckily, the essentia locus can help you with that, as it monitors all jars that have been targeted with a crystalline eye.

# Quest: Magic Mirror Glass?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b29.name=Magic Mirror Glass?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b29.desc=This glass seems useful for several things, including, perhaps, teleportation of items or essentia?

# Quest: Magical Item Teleportation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000129.name=Magical Item Teleportation
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000129.desc=It's annoying to do, but you can teleport items with this. Check the thaumonomicon for details.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000007c8.desc=Thaumic Machina offers Wand Augmentations. These useful modifications to your wand can boost their capacity, lower their vis usage, or do other interesting effects. 

# Quest: Charge Buffer
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000007c9.name=Charge Buffer
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000007c9.desc=A Charge Buffer augmentation to your wand allows it to hold 25 percent more vis.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000007ca.desc=This wand augment will lower the vis cost when using your wand by 10 percent. I'm not sure it works, but give it a try and report back, ok?

# Quest: Essentia Transmission

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b27.desc=What if... you could send essentia from a different location to your infusion matrix? You could finally get rid of all those jars around your altar.

# Quest: (Almost) Automated Essentia
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000012a.name=(Almost) Automated Essentia

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000012c.desc=As you do more and more infusions, you're getting tired of removing all the flux that's generated. The shovel of the purifier will help you cleaning up flux, and is a must-have.%n%n§3Actually this is pretty useless, if you have any concept of what you're doing.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000114.desc=You probably have a nice collection of bookmarked nodes. But running around to recharge your wand(s) isn't really the way an adept thaumaturge should get his required vis. Moving nodes is not that hard, but without doubt, you need something to protect them from each other.

# Quest: Centi-vis
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000113.name=Centi-vis
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000113.desc=Many advanced machines require vis in order to do what they're supposed to. But using a wand as some sort of battery to transfer vis from a node to your machine didn't work as expected. What if you could rip open a portal to another dimension and siphon power out of it using a node? Nothing could §opossibly§r go wrong with that, right?

# Quest: Centi-vis Stuff
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000116.name=Centi-vis Stuff
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000116.desc=You totally should get yourself some centi-vis things to transport and use the vis from stabilized nodes.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000566.desc=The Manipulator requires both XP levels and centi-vis in order to upgrade foci. Each Focus can be upgraded a total of five times, with the level and vis cost increasing by 8 for each upgrade. Some upgrades can be applied only at certain levels (often only at level 3), and others have prerequisite upgrades. Some upgrades like Frugal and Potency can be applied multiple times. All upgrades are permanent, and there is currently no way to remove them.

# Quest: Infuse Your Focus

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000810.desc=Many of the nodes of the wild have damage, and unjarring a captured node can also cause damage. The Node Manipulator can help you recover the nodes to full strength, and increase their recharge speed.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000115.desc=So you've found a way to gather nodes now. What about automated wand recharging? Wouldn't that be extremely convenient?

# Quest: Advanced Node Stabilizer
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000567.name=Advanced Node Stabilizer
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000567.desc=The advanced node stabilizer acts like a normal node stabilizer but with key differences. It will still stop the node it affects from being drained but the node can still drain from other, lesser nodes. It also has a higher chance to improve fading and unstable nodes. The downside is that any nodes it affects will have their recharge rates effectively reduced to nothing. They will recharge at an extremely reduced rate.

# Quest: Little Helpers

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008db.desc=Lonely? The Traveling Trunk is a simple companion, giving you some extra space. With upgrades (one per trunk) it can offer you some nice advantages. Like other golems, you can pick it up with the Golemancer's Bell. It's brain is pretty small though, so it can easily get stuck. You can order it to stay in one spot via the GUI. It will attempt to teleport to you, as long as the chunk is still loaded. It can also follow you into different dimensions.%n%nThey will heal slowly on their own, or faster if you right-click on them with any food, including rotten meat. Keep away from lava.%n%nGolem upgrade effects:%nAer: Moves faster%nEarth: 1 more row of item slots%nFire: Attacks hostile mobs, setting them on fire%nWater: Nearly invulnerable.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000451.desc=The second ritual will not be as easy as the first one. After this ritual your sigil will be stable enough to make stable unstable ingots which will not explode, and will no longer take durability damage.%n%nThis ritual needs to be performed in The End dimension. The ritual is performed by placing a Beacon in the center of a flat area of at least 11x11, not necessarily End Stone. Then place a chest in each of the cardinal directions leaving 4 spaces empty between the chest and the Beacon. In each chest insert these specific contents:%n%nNorth: iron ingot, gold ingot and the other things listed in the task.%nSouth: The different Ore Blocks and the other things listed in the task.%nEast: The potions.%nWest: The Music disks.%n%nA spiral pattern of Redstone and String is then laid out around the beacon. At any time, Shift+Right-clicking the Beacon with an Activated Division Sigil in hand will show the building progress of the ritual.%n%nFinally, kill an Iron Golem while it stands within the ritual area to activate the process. If it works, there will be an explosion that destroys the beacon and chests, while every Enderman in the End vanishes. During the ritual, throngs of aggresive mobs imbued with Haste will begin spawning and attacking the Player who needs to kill 100 of them to complete the ritual. If the Player dies or leaves the dimension, the ritual will fail and will have to be started over. Once enough mobs have been killed, the first activated Sigil in the inventory will stabilize. The Pseudo-Inversion Sigil can be used an unlimited number of times, and dividing an Iron Ingot by Diamond will produce Mobius "Unstable-Stable" Ingot which does not explode, can be produced in any crafting interface and will stack up to 64.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cb5.desc=To use the power of magical flowers, you must understand how to generate and manipulate mana. This ethereal blue-ish substance is produced by generating flowers, when their requirements are met. Mana is not easily quantified, so you will have to do a lot of estimating if you want to use it efficiently.%n%nOnce you have chosen which flower you want to use to generate mana, you must plant it near a mana spreader. When the flower's conditions are fulfilled, it will begin to produce mana, and store it in the internal buffer of the nearest mana spreader. The mana spreader itself will automatically emit any mana it contains, provided it is aimed at a valid destination (such as a mana pool). You'll need a lot of these devices, so craft a pair for now.%n%nMana spreaders will aim towards you when you place them down. To change their direction, use a wand of the forest: while holding the wand, shift+right click on the mana spreader, and then shift+right click on the block you want it to aim at. This method of binding also works for other things, such as binding a flower to a specific mana spreader.

It can efficiently consume fuels with a burn time of up to 64000 per item (equivalent to four blocks of coal); any burn time beyond this will be wasted.

This can be achieved by using three buckets of water on it, pumping water into it using pipes, or by using a Dispenser containing a Brew of Endless Water.%n%nOnce a cauldron is full of water, it must boil. Lighting a fire beneath the cauldron is the only way for this to happen. Using a netherrack block will guarantee the fire does not go out, although if it does go out, it may be set to boil again without any consequences (unlike brewing in a Kettle!).%n%nWhen the water is boiling, ingredients may be added to the Cauldron (one after another), to create the desired effect.

Be sure to have a Death Protection Poppet to protect you, because the ritual kills you. If playing hardcore, definitely test in a separate world first.%n%nTo bind a familiar, first, summon a Demon and tear out it's heart. No, seriously, go do it.

With this, not only are they a lot less likely to attack, they will even sell their brethren's hearts for a little less.%n%nJust remember that it can only be used a limited number of times, ok? It might also be worthwhile to use the Rite of Protection at the same time as summoning a demon. To do so just put down both circles, and meet the item (and Altar Power) requirements of both. If you're not planning on killing the demon, you should probably send it back when you're done with the Rite of Banishing on page 47/48 of the Circle Magic book.

See the official wiki for details. You may receive a tiny portion of damage your familiar receives (and vice-versa), so park it somewhere safe. Also note that if it dies, so will you (Supposedly).

Find some Coven Witches and complete their quests:%nThe means to control the dead -> Necromantic Stone%nThe beating means to master the infernal dimension -> Demon Heart%nI must perform many curses, bring me the necessary brew -> Brew of the Grotesquex5%nI desire to predict the future -> Crystal Ball%nOr just fight something.%n%nOnce completed, they'll disappear until you need them. They will sometimes appear near your spawn point if you walk by it, so don't position it over lava or something, since they CAN die and reduce the number of your coven. You can have 6, with one extra appearing for Cauldron work. Consider keeping some extras around in a dungeon just in case.%n%nAfter you recruit your coven, you just need a few things for the ritual itself: Spider Eye, Toe of Frog, Wool of Bat, Tongue of Dog, Owlet's Wing, Attuned Stone, and Attuned Stone (Charged).%n%nTo specify the biome, look in the Book of Biomes, and find 1) the type (Forest, Plains, etc), and 2) the number. Type determines the foci used, and number determines the amount of Glowstone Dust used to get that specific biome. Make sure to pack up a ritual circle into a circle talisman so you don't have to redraw it, and bring some cobblestone to make a flat area (15x15, any height). Try not to do it at night unless you like dealing with infernals.%n%nTo actually do the ritual, have the ritual circle on the ground, the items (including the foci and Glowstone) in the circle, and right-click the center with the Seer's Stone.%n%nThe area affected is determined by the number of witches in your coven. It's 16 * (size of coven - 3) radius in a circular area, so 16/32/48 if it doesn't fail.%n%nUnfortunately, sometimes after logging out and back in again you may find that it didn't work correctly in specific chunks, this is (possibly) due to lack of chunk updates and it not saving the changed biome ID correctly. Just redoing the ritual doesn't really help, you'll just get patches in the same places, however placing water after the ritual and before logging out may help with this. Or use chickens. Lots of chickens.%n%nAlso, if you already have crops in the area, they'll disappear until a block update or relog.%n%n§3PS: To pack your circle back up, you need to bring your altar with you.%n

It is incredibly stable even at extreme temperatures, but this also made it unable to pack together for coils.%n%nHowever, the situation changed when you thought about using something more intelligent. By integrating a Wetware or better UHV circuit, the Infinity Coil became a reality, controlled by the ever-watching eyes of the circuitry you've spent months to create. From now on, these eyes will watch over your multiblocks.%n%nProvides 11701 heat. You could upgrade your EBF, though at this point it's more likely to be for your MEBFs or your DTPF.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c93.desc=Beyond spacetime, beyond reality. You have peered into what never existed and brought into a fluid, and then a solid. It has been stabilized, against all odds. When you look at it, you think that you could hold the entire universe in your hand.%n%nIn the past, you were able to combine almost all materials into one, through an Eternal Singularity, an infinitely dense sample of the universe. However, automating this at the scale of the DTPF proved ridiculous, which would have stopped your progress altogether if not for the discovery of the Energized Tesseract. To physically manifest spacetime itself, you first needed to manifest the fourth spatial dimension, and that is what the Tesseract is: a 4-dimensional cube.%n%nCubes! Almost everything around you is made out of cubes. You have only glimpsed at the reality of the 4-dimensional world, but you have successfully used it to condensate spacetime, which can be arbitrarily molded into the complete Eternal mixture, a process that unfortunately cannot be reversed. Needless to say, living circuits will not suffice to maintain an infinitely dense, infinitely stable, multi-dimensional material.%n%nCurrently, the final upgrade with 13501K. This really makes your DTPF shine!

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a26.desc=You're not supposed to be here... I think you need to go outside and get some sunlight if you unlocked this legitmately...%n%nIn the meantime here's your reward, don't spend it all at once!

# Quest: You are worthy
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ca1.name=You are worthy

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a21.desc=Congratulations, you've beaten most of the pack! Here we have some absolutely outrageous final challenges for you. Maybe start by showing us your certificate.

# Quest: Longbow of the Heavens
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a9c.name=Longbow of the Heavens
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a9c.desc=Weak compared to both weapons of it's tier, and the weapons it's made of, this bow doesn't use arrows, never breaks, does 10 damage, and has an AoE of 10 more arrows that do 10 damage each fly down each time it strikes.

# Quest: Galaxy in a Bottle...?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a17.name=Galaxy in a Bottle...?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a17.desc=Good luck with this one, it is many many many times harder than the previous tiers. Required to make extremely endgame materials such as hypogen.

# Quest: Dragonblood
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cb0.name=Dragonblood
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cb0.desc=For your first batch of Hypogen you will need some Dragonblood. Maybe you already have some lying around somewhere from killing the dragon a long time ago. You have 2 other options though. Bees and the DE Fusion Crafter.%n%nFor the bee path you have to go very deep into the breeding tree, but maybe you have already done that? Check the Bee Breeding tab either way.%n%nIn the DE Fusion Crafter you have 2 recipes. The better one uses an Infinity Egg from Witchery. Without any Witchery you can also just a normal dragon egg for the weaker recipe.%n%nOnce you have a bit of Hypogen you can then use that as a starting point to make more in your DTPF without any Dragonblood. I don't know why it works that way, complain to Colen.%n%nHowever, you will still need more Dragonblood eventually for UMV superconductors.%n%n%n§3There is actually another way to get Dragonblood which is similar to the DE Fusion Crafter recipes but in the mixer instead. Its even slower and less resource efficient. In particular, the dragon egg does not survive the process. So only use that if you are absolutely trying to avoid magic and bees.%n%nJust a reminder: a fluid task just needs you to have the fluid in some container in your inventory. (cell, universal cell, large cell, volumetric cell, etc.)

# Quest: Hypogen
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a18.name=Hypogen
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000a18.desc=Here it is, the most high tier GT++ material. You will need UIV to process it. So for now that means you can only solidify it in a large processing factory from GT++.%n%n§3With your first ingot obtained, you can turn to the DTPF to make more. I think that recipe should be a lot better than the MK4 reactor.%n%nYou can also have this cake as a reward for coming this far.

# Quest: §6§lHypogen Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c92.name=§6§lHypogen Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c92.desc=Forged from the blood of an ageless dragon, and melded together by the power of fusion beyond what you thought was the reality. No natural element, or combination of elements, could match up to this glowing orange material, not even the Awakened Draconium you got your hands on before.%n%nWhat truly happened inside that Mk4 Fusion Reactor? What §ois§o§r this material? Its dust pulsates visibly, at different rates depending on the size of the dust itself. Hypogen approaches a state of complete balance as it approaches the block size, and it is obvious to you what needs to be done with it.%n%nIt absorbs and radiates energy without any effort, but it would be stupid to attempt making coils out of this without assistance. Wetware wasn't good enough anymore, and only the most advanced living circuit could withstand the erratic behavior Hypogen demonstrates.%n%nProvides 12601K heat. Almost certainly, this will end up on your DTPF.

# Quest: Tesseract
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ca7.name=Tesseract
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ca7.desc=Engineering beyond your comprehension. Destroying this strange higher dimensional object in a macerator is very easy though.

# Quest: PCB Factory Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cce.name=PCB Factory Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cce.desc=Why use a small nosel to print out the conductor on the board when one can just build it using nanites? Well the silver nanite isn't rigid enough for that so a new nanite will be needed... and so will new casings. Heard that celestial tungsten is a good candidate for a frame. Quantum can be used for the protection as these nanites will be forever flying around inside.%n%nThe structure will need to change as it needs to be a bit bigger and taller.%n%n§3Works the same as the Tier 2 in most cases, but allows the player to use even less resources by using a gold nanite.

# Quest: Nano Forge Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd1.name=Nano Forge Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd1.desc=Neutronium nanites are slow moving, but that allowed them to have a complex nanite network. If there was a material that could move itself it could allow for an even more compex nanite with great speeds... Thankfully with the DTPF fully functional we can make it, transcendent metal.%n%n§3Same thing as the neutronium nanite, but this nanite allows for tier 3 nanites to be made in the nano forge.

# Quest: Finally, you are here.

# Quest: Thermosink Radiator
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ccd.name=Thermosink Radiator
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ccd.desc=With the control of spacetime you have achieved and its 0K temperature it would be possible to make an even better cooling unit. A casing able to keep its room temperature very low and nanites which can transfer heat effectively because of their small bodies. This doesn't quite work and some coolant is still needed, but water freezes at those temperatures so super coolant will be our choice.%n%n§3The Thermosink Radiator allows for 4/4 OC making it possible to speed through recipes. It requires 10/s of super coolant in its hatch, its in the same place as the Liquid Cooling Tower.%n%n§4This upgrade is incompatible with its lower tier predecessor.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000096d.desc=In order to get to the riches you rightfully deserve, you'll first need to make a Raw Portal, then complete it with more materials. You can then access this dimension that should contain every ore imaginable...%n%n§3Unfortunately, those tasty ores are locked beneath the mantle of the planet. You'll need to use a Void Miner to get them out.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004.desc=Now that you've made it this far, notice the two new quests. See how these two quests look different? The quest with the jagged edges is a main quest and is linked to other main quests by a thick line. You must complete the main quests to unlock the next tier, or to progress in general. If you can't progress, go back to previous tiers and look for uncompleted main quests. The other quest is an optional quest, and is not needed to unlock new tiers. However, optional quests often introduce you to useful items or processes.%n%nWhat are the coins? You can use them to purchase things in the Coins tab. In case you started in a bad biome, I'll give you enough coins to purchase some saplings.

# Quest: §1§lSharpness: Over... 5...

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000b.desc=It's about time to craft something more useful: A sword!%n%nNow that you have a sword, you will get credit for monster kills in the Kill All the Things tab. Watch out, monsters in this world will chew you up and spit you out!%n%n§3PS: You can find additional weapon quests on the Getting Around Without Dying tab.

# Quest: §1§lShields UP
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001be.name=§1§lShields UP
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001be.desc=With a sword in one hand, what can you do with the other? Right, you need a shield. Let's make one.

# Quest: §1§lShield Update
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001c0.name=§1§lShield Update
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001c0.desc=Your wooden shield is very weak. So you should make a better one. Looks like you need some leather, so go and find some cows.

# Quest: §1§lYour First 'Long Range' Weapon
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001c2.name=§1§lYour First 'Long Range' Weapon
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001c2.desc=Since you can't make a vanilla bow before LV and Tinkers weapons are not available in this Tier, you can make a spear out of sticks, leather and a string. Get one because some infernal monsters are easier to kill with a long range weapon.

# Quest: §2§lStone spear
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000291.name=§2§lStone spear
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000291.desc=Upgrade your wooden spear with a stone arrowhead and iron screws to a stone spear.%nThis spear has better durability than the wooden one.

# Quest: §1§lMoron's Manual for Massacring Monsters
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000731.name=§1§lMoron's Manual for Massacring Monsters
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000731.desc=If you haven't noticed, this world is a true hellscape full of Special Mobs and Infernals around every corner. Unlike vanilla, a player has to actually stay aware and pay attention to what they are fighting. Here are some tips.%n%nIf an infernal has Vengeance, don't shoot it with your 56 damage crossbow!%n%nA high health infernal with regeneration is hard to kill. Even worse if it is a witch that can also heal itself. In those cases, run like hell, or bring a soul vial to capture it and throw it into Mount Doom. %n%nWatch out for zombies with fishing poles - they can pull you into them. And zombies with a bow and arrow - they can shoot you back!

# Quest: §3§lSteam-a-licious!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000046.name=§3§lSteam-a-licious!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000046.desc=You've almost made it. One last crafting step is required in order to advance to Tier 1. Keep going!%n%nThis Steam Turbine generates electricity from Steam. The power source you've been using is the same, but from this point on you will generate EU, and bring it to your machines via cables, instead of bringing the Steam directly to them. Luckily, electric machines don't need an exhaust port, and they are considerably more efficient than Bronze machines.%n%nAt a later point, you will most likely switch from Steam to another fuel, though.

# Quest: §3§lSafety First
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000871.name=§3§lSafety First
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000871.desc=For those new to GregTech, here are some tips and warnings about electricity. %n%nMachines don't like being out in the rain, and will start fires nearby. Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier cause an explosion. Or several, if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.%n%nSending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a wire does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.%n%nA generator that supplys 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than full voltage.  For example, macerators doing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run several off of a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. Why? Because there's loss for every amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are better than wires. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.%n%nMost machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier) + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding cables.%n%nSome machines are specifically for dealing with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers, and diodes.%n%nIf you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV and LV has thier own lossless cables). You can use the laser hatches much later to send even more.%n%nA single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.%n%nNote that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ tier. So 2 EU at LV, 4 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of your power, and even 1 can prevent usage of an EBF at MV voltage. Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes less of something to worry about.%n%nIf this info isn't enough for you, head on over to https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Electricity to read more.

# Quest: §6§lDark Steel Tools
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000008c.name=§6§lDark Steel Tools
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000008c.desc=There are also tools made of dark steel. Each of them can receive upgrades. Hold shift to get the tooltip which will explain what you need in order to upgrade them.%n%nThese tools can also be enchanted like vanilla tools.%n%nThe Ender will increase wither skull and ender pearl drops. It can be upgraded to teleport the player.%n%nDark shears can be empowered, and then will shear a large area, including leaves. Handy for clearing away that giant redwood! Maybe you will find other uses for it.%n%nThe axe, once empowered, can be recharged wirelessly while in farming station.%n%nThe pick? Well, it can mine cobalt I guess if you haven't gotten a tool capable of that yet. You could keep it around to use for base decorations if your normal pick is too fast, I suppose.

# Quest: §9§lAnd It Will Never Break
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000098.name=§9§lAnd It Will Never Break
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000098.desc=By using an etheric sword, your killer joe will run...forever. Proper enchantments are a requirement for it to be efficient, but that shouldn't be a problem.

# Quest: §a§lAppropriate Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000be.name=§a§lAppropriate Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000be.desc=Whether you used magic, steam, oil or biogas for power until now, you will run into problems as you advance to higher tiers. So you'll need to upgrade your power grid, at least for your EBF(s). So let's start with something more powerful: A nuclear reactor!%n%nIf you want to know how they work, refer to The Internet or the Reactor Planner at https://github.com/MauveCloud/Ic2ExpReactorPlanner/releases%n%nNote: The EU multiplier is set to 10x in this pack. That means your nuclear reactor is 10 times more efficient. Make sure to set the planner to GTNH mode under advanced. Also, the base numbers (before 10xing) can be seen on the hover text for all the components.%n%nIf you just want to use them, go to https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Nuclear_Reactors for reactor designs. The Thorium 1920 EU one is probably best for now.

# Quest: §a§lBasic Nuclear Fuel: Thorium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c1.name=§a§lBasic Nuclear Fuel: Thorium
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c1.desc=The weakest of all fuel rods, but very easy to produce, very easy to keep cool and runs twice as long as uranium. It even returns 1/3 of the thorium back later. A perfect "fission and forget" power source.%n%n§4Note: After they're used up you can recycle them to get Lutetium which is used for making americium in the fusion reactor. Americium is §lneeded§r§4 for top tier materials later, so start stockpiling now. Plus, you get power!

# Quest: §a§lDouble the Fun
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000076b.name=§a§lDouble the Fun
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000076b.desc=Need even more power? Why not combine rods? Produces more power (NOT double, it varies per rod type) and more heat (again NOT double) but only uses up one slot. You need more complex designs to handle them, but you were ready for that, right?%n%nSo how about doubling your doubling to double your double (4x)? Quad rods put out even more power and heat, expect all the other rods to work similarly (for the most part).%n%n§3BTW it's more efficient to go 1->4 rather than 1->2->4 materials-wise.

# Quest: §a§lUnfortunately, There's No Depleted Uranium Bullets
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000076c.name=§a§lUnfortunately, There's No Depleted Uranium Bullets
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000076c.desc=After your rods have finished their cycle they turn into depleted rods. You can then thermal centrifuge them for some materials back. Depending on the rod, you can get different stuff, see NEI or the wiki for details.

# Quest: §a§lIncreasing the Capacity
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c3.name=§a§lIncreasing the Capacity
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c3.desc=To unleash the full potential of your reactor, you have to attach six reactor chambers to it.

# Quest: §a§lMonitoring Your Reactor
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c2.name=§a§lMonitoring Your Reactor
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c2.desc=It's important to monitor your reactor (Or just fancy to have a big screen somewhere...). So now that you've gained knowledge about the available fuel rods, you can start to build yourself a power plant. Here is something to help you out.%n%nUse the sensor kit on the block you want to monitor, then put the sensor card in the display panel. Next select which lines of information you want to display.

# Quest: §a§lMove the Heat
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c4.name=§a§lMove the Heat
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c4.desc=Reactors heat up, so you need to "move the heat away" to somewhere else. Either read a wiki and try to comprehend how these work, or give up and just use the versions on the wiki.

# Quest: §a§lVenting Heat
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c5.name=§a§lVenting Heat
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000c5.desc=You can't just move the heat around, eventually you need to get rid of it. Just like the exchangers, there are different types of vents, each of them has a certain usage. Same as the other quest, either read a wiki and try to comprehend how these work, or give up and just use the versions on the wiki.

# Quest: §a§lNo Boom Tomorrow
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000076e.name=§a§lNo Boom Tomorrow
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000076e.desc=With a nuke, you can cause some real catastrophic damage to your base. You can either place it 20 chunks away, or surround it with blast proof materials.%n%nFused Quartz is no good now, forget about it ok? Instead, use the GTNH approved Plated Reinforced Stone series! Or one of the other options I guess, like Warded Glass. You may need multiple layers depending on your reactor, try it out in creative. Remember you must close in the corners - blasts can slip through the cracks. To get power out, do right angle turns on the wires as blasts go in a straight line.%n%n§3There are 6 of them, use NEI.%n%nOkay, okay, you don't have to forget Fused Quartz, I'll give you some. Maybe you can stop rain with it.

# Quest: §b§lMallard Rust Smelly
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000588.name=§b§lMallard Rust Smelly
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000588.desc=Or is it Alloy Blast Smelter? Well, that makes more sense. This multiblock creates the higher tier alloys needed for the more advanced GT++ multiblocks and your soldering needs. It directly smelts ingredients into liquids. You can even melt down metals like Tungsten faster too! Until you get better coils for your EBF at least.%n%n§3Can only have one energy hatch.%n%nThe GT++ multiblocks you can now make are optional, but quite powerful upgrades to your current singleblock setups. Not only do they provide more speed, they also have a bit of advanced functionality: you can also electrolyze materials without using cells or use a single multiblock for many different extruder shapes. They also act as cleanrooms where needed.

# Quest: EU packets flowing everywhere...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000058a.name=EU packets flowing everywhere...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000058a.desc=...in my dreams. What if instead of having battery packs on every generator, we could centralize all the generation in one location? Put it away from the well travelled parts of the the base? Out in the country somewhere?  Let the animals deal with the pollution.  Anyways, let's start working on a Power Sub-Station to store EU and deliver it to our base.

# Quest: This is Not How You Get Into Space
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000aca.name=This is Not How You Get Into Space
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000aca.desc=This produces power out of Rocket Fuels. To see how to make them, look at the Space Race tab. These are specifically GT++ Rocket Fuels, and automating them for powergen in this multi will also provide you with endless fuel for your space travels.%n%nThe math regarding the Rocketdyne is complicated. Looking at the controller's tooltip helps, but the main gist of it is like this: provide Carbon Dioxide and make sure it doesn't run out, choose the EU/t you want to get, calculate the amount of fuel you need for the fuel you will use, and then provide enough Liquid Hydrogen to boost the multi, according to the EU/t value.%n%nYou will always want to have the Rocketdyne boosted, for several reasons. Assuming you have at least a buffered IV Dynamo Hatch, outputting close to the maximum on that hatch will lower the fuel efficiency, but not if it's boosted. Additionally, this multi doesn't consume fuel continuously, but with intervals of 1 second between consuming and not consuming, while generating power all the same. Boosting this consumption results in huge fuel efficiency, combined with the high fuel values of the Rocket Fuels.%n%n§3This multi is IV.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000184.desc=You have tinkered long and hard to try to combine magic and technology. It looks like you finally found a way! Combining your powers as a thaumaturge and blood mage with your UHV technology you think you have found a way to distill the power of a dragon into a small core. This machine can do it, you are sure. If only you know how precisely to assembler such a core.%n%n%n§3Use a hologram projector to see how it is built. You can also upgrade your draconic cores but for that you need the higher tier schematics and you need to upgrade the multiblock.

# Quest: §2§lMaking a Better Sword
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001d9.name=§2§lMaking a Better Sword
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000001d9.desc=Now it's time to make your first tinkers sword. First you have to make a blade, a type of guard, and tool rod cast forms. Melt some bronze in the smeltery and cast your tool parts. Tadaa... your first tinkers sword. There are 4 types of guard, changing them gets you a different sword type, see the tinker's book for details.

# Quest: §5§lExploding Fluids For Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000214.name=§5§lExploding Fluids For Power
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000214.desc=The Combustion Generator produces EU from several fluids. Some are more popular than others, but the Oil processing line has a different combustion fluid in every tier from LV to EV, and all of them are burned in these generators.%n%nTo start, LV is the tier of Light Fuel. It is worth much more than the Oil itself for generating power, so you should distill and dessulfurize the Oil to get clean Light Fuel and use it for power. It's a great way to run your base, and can be upgraded further in the next tiers. Check the "Working with Oil" tab for more information, once you've made a Pump and found some Oil.%n%n§3If you're dealing with Oil processing, this is the type of generator you'll use the most.§r

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000215.desc=Some centrifugal processes leave gases behind like Hydrogen or Methane. Centrifuge some Brown and Yellow Limonite to get Hydrogen or dump your unused food in a Centrifuge to get Methane gas. Wood will even give 60 mb per log, and many other crops will also generate Methane this way.%n%nThe main powergen line that uses this generator is Benzene, but that needs MV tier.%n%n§3If you're dealing with fully renewable powergen, this is the type of generator you'll use the most.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000222.desc=During your travels you may have seen some huge oil spouts. Now's the time to make a pump and go collect this black gold into tanks. Oil can be burned directly in a combustion generator (onsite to power the pump, perhaps?) or be refined for better fuels and crafting materials. %n%nBring a generator or battery buffer (with full batteries obviously) with you to power the pump. Thanks to the advancement of technology the pump can auto output on top. Stacking multiple pumps makes them work faster. In that case, oil has to be removed from the bottom of the stack using a pump cover or other means like a conduit.%n%nTaller spouts have more oil. But for the LV pump, it's better to use the short spouts if possible since it doesn't have enough range to fully collect the larger ones in the horizontal range. Save the taller spouts for MV or HV pumps.%n%nMining pipes are needed for pumping the oil, same as the auto miner. When it hits the bottom (or something in the way), if there's no fluid left to collect, it will start retracting the pipes. Same thing if you disable it with a soft mallet. You can also change the range with a screwdriver if there's a reason to do that, like collecting lava in a limited area faster.%n%nThese are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on all sides. And set a waypoint with JourneyMaps so you don't forget where you placed it!%n%n§3Once you run out of surface oil, you'll want to turn to:%n1) Oilsands ore, though this is better suited for making heavy oil%n2) Making oil from logs in a pyro%n4) Ridiculous bio vat nonsense%n5) Crops%n6) Bees%n7) The real answer, which is Underground or UG oil. Dims generally have a couple fluids that can be accessed with a multiblock version of the pump, available in MV+. Go read the quest for it when it's available for details

# Quest: Moron's Manual to Fecund Farms
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002ce.name=Moron's Manual to Fecund Farms
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000002ce.desc=If you ever wanted to know how crop breeding works you are in the right place. Get some crops (the sticks) and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. %n%nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdWdFFF%ndddFFFddd%nFFFdddFFF%ndddFFFddd %nFFFdddFFF%nNow place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.%n%nWhen they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.%n%nWith some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.%n%nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.%n%nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds. %n%nIf you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.%n%nNote that the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.%n%nDon't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing. %n%nCrossing happens when 2 or more almost mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a high chance of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation. More details in the IC2 cropnalyzer quest.

Craft the bow limbs out of wood and the bow string out of strings. The arrow that has the most durability is bone, so craft the stick out of bone. It is much lighter but less durable than a regular arrow. Use a flint tip to make it repairable with flint.%n%n§4You can repair your bow the same way as all the other Tinkers tools.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000045b.name=Moron's Guide to Better Trees
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000045b.desc=Forestry trees have a variety of attributes.  Once you get a tree with a useful attribute, you can breed that attribute into other tree species. This way you can get an ultimate tree that combines all the attributes you want - including the type of fruit! you can also extract the genes with Gendustry if you can make the machines.%n%nIT IS RECOMMENDED YOU DO YOUR FORESTRY TREE BREEDING IN AN ENCLOSED AREA, OR UNDERGROUND. BUTTERFLIES ARE A KNOWN LAG SOURCE.%n%nFor faster tree breeding, enclose your trees so that butterflies cannot escape, and breed bees with better traits for area and pollination speed. There's also frames too if you can afford it. The sieve may also help if you want to do it more exactly if you can make an alveary. §3PS: You need either bees or butterflies, trees won't pollinate each other. §r%n%n§eSaplings/Fertility§r: Chance of getting a sapling from a detroyed leaf.

Wider trees have more leaves and logs, but will also need more saplings to begin growing. All saplings must be the same species and girth. The sapling in the NW corner determines the stats of the new tree, and is where bone meal must be applied to mature the tree. The Giant Sequoia is best here too.%n%nAllele/Size%n1x1%n2x2%n3x3%n4x4 %n%nYield: Chances of getting a fruit from a destroyed leaf.

All other trees just need light to grow.%n%n§3Territory/Soil§r: All trees have Average, whatever that means. Probably something related to the below that never really got used.%n%n§eTolerates§r: If it can be planted on sand or not. Only Desert Acacia and Grandidier's Baobab have this. The trait is either Plains or Plains, Desert.%n%n§5Supports§r: What kind of fruits it can theoretically have. Determined by Species. Only fruits from families listed under this trait can be produced by the tree, regardless of what appears under the tree's §aFruits§r trait. There's a number of Extra Trees trees that support all 4 types, but none from Forestry itself.%n%n§aFruit§r: Determines what fruit or nut it produces. Each fruit/nut provides different advantages:%nPlum and Cherry Plum only produces 100L Fruit Juice, but have a 60%% chance of producing Mulch in the Fluid Extractor or Squeezer.%nPapaya produces 600L Fruit Juice, but only has a 10%% chance to produce Mulch.%nCoconuts produce 300L Seed Oil, but only have a 25%% chance to produce Mulch.%nUse a forestry Multifarm so you don't have to break the leaf block to get the fruit/nut. Set it to Manual Orchard, and place everything first.%n%n§bFamily§r: Tells you what family of the fruit listed under the Fruits trait is: Pomes, Prunes, Nuts or Jungle.%n%n§4When breeding these trees for quests, you will need to breed the species "pure", not a hybrid. Fortunately, that's much easier for trees. You should probably save the crossbreeding 'till after you get all the good ones.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000046f.desc=To get your simple ore washer working you need a ULV Transformer. The Washer can only work with 8 EU. If you put more energy into it you get a big hole in your base.%n%n§3This will probably be the only one you make in the game.

# Quest: §9§lKinetic Power HV
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000471.name=§9§lKinetic Power HV
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000471.desc=The Kinetic Generator will transform mechanical energy into electricity. The EU output depends on the KU input. It is most commonly used together with a Kinetic Wind Generator or Kinetic Water Generator. The Kinetic Steam Generator only has one tier, so your should probably use a Steam Turbine instead.%n%nWhen placing a kinetic generator, any time, the "input" side is the side facing you.  So you will place the kinetic generator, then the wind/water/steam gen, and then place a rotor inside. Power can be drawn from any side of the kinetic generator, up to the rated amount per side. %n%nWARNING: Breaking a kinetic generator improperly will not return the generator.  Use a GT wrench, and right-CLICK it.  It should drop immediately.  Try again if it just changed directions. 

# Quest: §9§lKinetic Wind Power HV
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000472.name=§9§lKinetic Wind Power HV
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000472.desc=The Kinetic Wind Generator generates energy from wind power which varies randomly, although certain factors can change this.%n%nUnlike the Windmill, the Kinetic Wind Generator will require maintenance in the form of Rotors. These are needed to run the Kinetic Wind Generator.%nOnce a Rotor is placed inside the GUI, the block is given sufficient space, and the current wind level is adequate for the current rotor, the Kinetic Wind Generator will begin to generate Kinetic Energy. %n%nThis can be converted into EU by using a Kinetic Generator attached to the correct face (the black circle).%n%nAbout Wind%nFirst off, the wind strength of a particular area is affected by 3 factors: Height, Weather, and Chance. The higher up in the world you are, the higher the wind level. Below y64, there is never enough wind to be used, and KWG's will not function at all. Weather will also give boosts; Rainy weather will give a 20%% boost to normal wind levels, and stormy weather will give a 50%% boost. The final factor of chance makes the wind strength vary randomly, however there is a limited range of variation.%n%nThe easiest way to check the current wind level in an area is by using a Windmeter. Wind is strongest at around Y160, towards the build limit of Y255 there is very little wind, hence no point attempting to run Windmills that high. While inconvenient, the Wind Generator can run anywhere.

# Quest: §9§lKinetic Water Power HV
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000473.name=§9§lKinetic Water Power HV
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000473.desc=The Kinetic Water Generator allows Kinetic Units to be produced via the movement of water in river and ocean biomes. As with the Kinetic Wind Generator, it requires either Gearbox Rotor. Search NEI for appropriate options.%n%nIf the Kinetic Water Generator's Rotor isn't entirely submerged in water, it will alert you there is "no room for the rotor". If the Kinetic Water Generator isn't placed in a river, ocean or deep ocean biome, it will alert you it "must be placed in a river or ocean biome". Check the Game Mechanics spreadsheet on Discord for a list of biomes and their tags.%n%nWhile inconvenient, the Water Generator runs more consistently.%n%n§4You can use Witchery (for example) to convert biomes.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000474.desc=The Kinetic Wind and Water Generators need Gearbox Rotors to function. They can be added and removed with standard automation. Higher tier rotors will last longer. In addition, the iridium ones don't break. The IC2 ones might bug out for durability loss though. Energetic is probably the best for now, since it can give out a full amp, and more is wasted.%n%n§3You only need to make one rotor to complete this quest.

# Quest: §9§lSending the Power Back

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000479.desc=Kinetic generator compatibility has been improved so that you no longer need transformers, you can connect directly with a cable. But why not use your transformer to send the power back to base more efficiently, it's a loss of about 57/512EU per A just going from 160 straight down to 63 without it. If you transform up (after going through 1 block of cable to transform it to GT power), you only lose about 57/2048EU per A, much better.%n%n§4IC2 machines don't care about rain, but remember to cover your transformer.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000047a.desc=Maybe you are wondering why the new pipes don't auto-connect anymore? This was changed to make the pipes smarter. You can now use a wrench to connect only the pipes you want. You don't need a plate or a foil to prevent pipes from connecting anymore.%n%nPipes transferring anything hotter than a certain amount (like steam) will cause damage to a player touching them. You'll want to cover hot pipes to prevent getting hurt if you want to walk over them. Also, if the heat level is higher than the pipe's heat capacity, it will melt.%n%nRight clicking on a pipe in the center of the 'grid' will enable or disable a connection. It will have an X through it if the connection is enabled. You can do the same to any of the 4 corners to adjust the opposite side. You can similarly connect each of the 4 sides by clicking on the closest box in the grid.%n%nAlso, pipes now come with a shutter built in for free to reduce sloshing. Shift-rightclick with a wrench on the side you want prevent input.%n%nPipes will attempt to transfer 1/2 of the capacity twice per second, so the full capacity per second in total.%n%nLarge or Huge fluid pipes can be a poor man's storage tank, holding large amounts on their own.%n%nFor machine outputs, including the boilers, and RC water tanks (the one made of water tank siding), you will not need pumps. Other tanks will need pumps or Tinker's Construct faucets to move fluids.%n%nYou can put covers such as GT oak planks or plates on a pipe as well. Normally this prevents connections in that direction, but you can use a screwdriver to enable connections. This lets you make pipes that look nice going through walls. Use a crowbar to remove covers.%n%n§3Hint: If you click one pipe onto the other they will auto-connect.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000004b1.desc=Your fancy new Large Plasma Turbine will need a rotor to go inside of it. %n%nYou can make it out of any GT material, but the best right now is NORMAL Draconium. §4Always test in Creative first!§r%n%nWhen using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Plasma Turbines being the best at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.%n%nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 250%% of optimal flow to produce 158%% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 400%% of optimal flow to produce 214%% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 550%% of optimal flow to produce 301%% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.%n%nThe choice is yours!%n%n§3For a lot of extra information on fusion, check out the new quest line called Powerful Nuclear Physics.

# Quest: Light It Up!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000055a.name=Light It Up!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000055a.desc=The arcane lamp creates additional light sources which acts like a Torch in a sphere with a radius of 16 blocks centered on it. This will include caves or other areas behind walls. That might be useful... One downside, it might put a light where one isn't wanted, like inside an EBF. %n%nWhen attached to the base of an arcane bore, the arcane lamp gains an additional ability: It will light up the tunnel that the bore digs.

# Quest: §6§lCough Cough - Something Needs to Be Done About the Smell

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000589.desc=Birds falling out of the sky, fish dead and floating belly up in the rivers, acid rain melting the ground...Time to start picking up the trash and cleaning up the air. Small black steel turbines should be fine for now. You'll need two amps of steady power to keep the scrubber working.%n%nThe detector's setting can be changed by clicking on the +/- texture with a screwdriver. Also, in general, better (and larger) turbines work better at cleaning up pollution. The code is too complex to fully explain here, but that's basically it. More EU turbine = more pollution cleaning turbine.%n%n§4This quest covers one method of combating pollution - there are others, including not making as much to begin with.

# Quest: Arc Lamp
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005b8.name=Arc Lamp
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005b8.desc=The Arc Lamp is a very bright lamp. It is directional - meaning the light it casts is brighter in the direction it is facing. Its facing can be rotated using a standard Wrench.%n%nIncluding the Arc Lamp the brightness of blocks which are close to light sources is:%n%nRedstone Torch: 3-6%nTorch: 9-12%nBlock of Glowstone: 10-13%nArc Lamp: 13-14%n%nThe Arc Lamp can light up a fairly large area - for example a whole room - at light level 14: it is almost as bright as full sunlight.%n%nThe Arc Lamp also has the interesting property of actively repelling mobs. Not only does its light prevent mobs from spawning nearby, but it is so bright that if a mob comes close to the Arc Lamp the mob will turn around and walk away again. This mob repellant effect is confirmed to work on: Zombies, Skeletons, Creepers, Evolved Zombies, Evolved Skeletons, Evolved Creepers. It may also work on other types of mobs (confirmation required). But it has no effect on Spiders (they are not afraid of sunlight either) or boss mobs.

Use the Default Load Block to do it for you without having to enter creative mode - you don't lose progress, but you'll have new quests to complete! Use the items to craft it, then place it and right-click.%n%nSorry, no rewards, other than the satisfaction of knowing it's you versus the world.%n%n§3PS: This is the same as /bq_admin default load.

# Quest: §2§lHow the Heck Do I Find Ores?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005d8.name=§2§lHow the Heck Do I Find Ores?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005d8.desc=GregTech ore generation is based on veins. Veins are centered on orecenters, based on the chunk number. Look at upper left of the screen to find the chunk number. Those infos are displayed by InGame Info XML mod. It has some useful info, but for now you need to see chunk info like "Chunk X: 3 Z: -2".%n%nThe 3,-2 is the chunk's address. Ignore the negative sign.  Now, the orecenters are located at 3N+1 chunks.  So, 4,7 is an orecenter. 10,16. -22,19.  Etc. %nProtip: to find out if a number is divisible by 3, add the digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3.  So 86 = 8+6 = 14. So you need to go down 1 chunk or up 2 chunks so that you are on a 3N+1 chunk.%n%nFor reading all the way, I'll give you an ingot of iron.%n%n§6TLDR: There's an ore vein every 3 chunks. Look in the upper left to see if you're over one.%n%n§3They have nothing to do with biomes, ok?

# Quest: §2§lDigging Deeper

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005d9.desc=Now that you know where to dig, dig all the way down to bedrock to find if there is a vein located there.%n%nNow, what if you know what you want but not where to find it? Our fancy bartimaeusnek developer has added a nifty feature to NEI that shows you where to find ores! Simply look for the oreblock in NEI, and click on it for info on where to find that ore.%n%nThere are many types of ores, even just for getting one material like Iron. So don't stick to only one type.%n%nYou can also search small ores, but not all of them are used.

# Quest: §1§lBetter Questing?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005dc.name=§1§lBetter Questing?
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005dc.desc=Better Questing has a number of commands, I'll list the useful ones here so ya'll can stop asking on discord. Note that you need to have cheats enabled to use them.%n%nIf your world does not have cheats enabled, there's a workaround: On the ESC screen, open to LAN, then enable cheats. This makes pausing impossible, so consider reloading your world after. If you are using a personal server, you can do the command on the command line, without the /. You can also edit the level.dat file, and set 'allowCommands' to 1. Make sure to make a backup first, and use NBTExplorer or a similar program to do so.%n%n§l/bq_admin edit§r%nTurns on edit mode so you can edit quests, like me. You can use it to §6see all the quests and their requirements§r, but §6View Mode§r button is quicker and usable on multiplayer. Hover over a quest to see the requirements, and ID, if you've enabled extended tooltips with F3 + H (outside of the QB).%n%n§l/bq_admin reset all <Player>§r%nResets ALL quests. Use this if you want to start over, or are editing the QB. You should define the player as well if it's a server, otherwise you can skip that part.%n%n§l/bq_admin reset <number> <Player>§r%nResets a specific quest, defined by the number. It may be easier to go into edit mode and use the designer tool to specify which to reset in SP though.%n%n§l/bq_admin complete <number> <Player>§r%nCompletes a specific quest, similarly to above. You can still claim the rewards. §6Use this if a quest is broken, and then report it on GitHub!§r After checking if it's already reported of course.%n%n§l/bq_admin default load§r%nReloads the quest database from the file. Your save has a version of the QB that it stores that can be different from the one in the file. §6Use this command after updating the pack to update the QB!§r%n%n§l/bq_admin default save§r%nSaves changes to the QB after editing it. Make sure to turn edit mode off first and reset all quests, because it saves both of those.%n%n§l/bq_admin hardcore§r%nEnables BQ3 Hardcore Mode. You only start with 3 lives, so best of luck. Additional life hearts are available in the Kill all the Things tab.%n%n§l/bq_copyquests <PlayerWithQuestsCompleted> <NewPlayer>§r%n§6Syncs quests with another player.§r If someone joins your party and you don't want to help them through all the quests, use this. They do not gain any rewards from the quests!%n%nAbout Party Syncing: Party syncing works, but if you have someone join later, you'll need to help them go through all the quests first. This is mostly annoying in the first two ages, as they're mostly crafting tasks, instead of retrieval you can just have them pick up. You always need to do consume tasks separately though. %n%n§4For quests to save properly, you must be online and logged into your Mojang account when starting the game. Sorry, it's a limitation of Better Questing.§r

# Quest: §1§lBackup Your Stuff...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005dd.name=§1§lBackup Your Stuff...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005dd.desc=AromaBackup is included with the pack. Adjust the settings as you like (frequency, number of backups to keep, etc). You can also use another mod like FTB Utilities, or even an external program. Try not to use more than one, or it'll just use up disk space and CPU power for no reason.%n%nIf you need to restore from a backup, the AB ones are found in the backups folder in the instance directory, not the world save directory.%n%nRemember though, JourneyMap and Thaumcraft Node Tracker information isn't included with AromaBackup, so you should backup your journeymap and tcnodetracker directories yourself if you don't trust them or are moving data to another drive or computer. Also, the Thaumcraft data is a little buggy, losing scanned aspect data and Thaumonomicon data, so consider backing up that file as well, the file is the 'saves\<worldname>\playerdata\<nameofplayer>.thaum' file.

# Quest: §6§lNobody Wants an Explosion...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005df.name=§6§lNobody Wants an Explosion...
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005df.desc=...right? So when building multiblocks, make sure you%n%n1. Don't cross chunk boundaries with the multiblock.%n%n2. Don't rely on resources coming from outside the chunk to prevent explosions. In other words, make sure you source your water locally.%n%nAlso, if you haven't discovered it yet, Electric machines don't like getting rain or snow on them. They'll start fires, and those fires have a chance of causing an explosion. This explosion will explode other machines, cascading until your whole base is a hole in the ground. This is one of the reason backups are a thing. Stay safe out there!%n%nGood luck.%n%n§3BTW, there's also an Explosion.log file in the logs folder that tracks what caused an explosion if you're unsure. It appears to reset on world load though.

# Quest: §2§lNot Enough Items - Now with Bookmarks!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005e1.name=§2§lNot Enough Items - Now with Bookmarks!
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005e1.desc=More like too many items! Here are some tips for using NEI.%n%nWhen you have your inventory open, you can type the search terms in the text bar at the bottom. Make sure your GUI size is set correctly, or you won't be able to see it. Double-click the bar to highlight any matching items in your inventory or inventories you're looking at. Handy for searching for a specific ore, as they tend to look the same!%n%nEven better, you can use T to search nearby inventories, which will emit some particles. %n%nWe have also provided the special Y command to look for a machine in the world, in case you've forgotten where you placed that Advanced Circuit Assembler.%n%nWe now have an extra-fancy Bookmark feature! The default key is A, but can be changed in the NEI config window. Bookmarks will be on the left side of the inventory, and you can use R and U on the bookmarks to see the recipes or uses for that item, as normal.%n%nPushing O will hide NEI, useful for fancy screenshots.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005e2.name=§2§lNEI Is More Powerful Than You Imagine
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000005e2.desc=NEI has some really nice advanced features too.%n%nClick on an item to see the recipe to create it, and press Backspace to go back to the previous recipe. %n%nHold Shift to stop the oredict cycling through items, and to show the oredict entries for the current item under your cursor.%n%nSearch using #oredict to find items that match that oredict; for example, #dyewhite will list all white dyes.%n%nUse * (asterisk) as a wildcard. For example #pipe*bronze will show you bronze pipes of all sizes.%n%nSearch using @mod. to find all items from that mod; for example, @mod.thaumcraft will list all thaumcraft items and blocks. Note that you need the whole name before it works.%n%nYou can even search a subset now with the right text. @mod.thaumcraft->table will search for anything with table in the name, in the mod thaumcraft. %n%n@thaumcraft and @thaumcraft-> will also search for anything from the mod thaumcraft, but only if the name is set correctly on the tooltip of the item. They basically always are though.%n%nIt has even more advanced features than mentioned here, you should check the web for details. Or just play around with the options.

# Quest: Witchery Seeds
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000618.name=Witchery Seeds
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000618.desc=To get Witchery seeds, use a hoe on grass blocks away from water. To open the rest of the questline, you will need to do Thaumcraft quests and research the Witchery tab in the Thaumonomicon.%n%nAccording to legend, when the root of the Mandrake plant is dug up it screams and kills all who hear it. This is only partially true. A fully grown Mandrake may scream causing immense discomfort to those around. This is why it is best to harvest the Mandrake root at night when the plant is more likely to be dormant. The fully grown Mandrake can be harvested to obtain more Mandrake seeds and a Mandrake.%n%nBreaking a fully grown Mandrake plant will either yield Mandrake Root or the Mandrake may awaken and cause all sorts of mischief (and pain to the ears!).%n%nBelladonna seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage belladonna plant. The fully grown belladonna plant can be harvested to obtain more Belladonna seeds and a Belladonna flower.%n%nSnowbell seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage snowbell plant. The fully grown snowbell plant can be harvested to obtain more Snowbell seeds, snowballs and occasionally a Icy Needle.%n%nWater Artichoke seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Water Artichoke plant. The fully grown Water Artichoke plant can be harvested to obtain more Water Artichoke seeds and a Water Artichoke Globe.%n%nWater Artichoke seeds can only be planted on water source blocks.%n%nGarlic is a plantable crop that can be used to make tasty food, and to deal with vampires. Garlic can be obtained by breaking tall grass, although it has a very low drop chance. It may be planted on tilled farm land, and will grow in five stages. When full grown the plant may be harvested for up to three dropped garlic bulbs. Which may either be replanted, or used in a crafting recipe.%n%nGarlic bulbs can be used to make meaty stew, a particularly nourishing meal. It is also the main ingredient in making a Garlic Garland, a useful tool in warding off vampires. Finally, garlic can be used by witches in a Witches' Cauldron to make a vampire Weakening brew, and by Witch Hunters, to make vampire resistant armor.%n%nWolfsbane seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Wolfsbane plant. The fully grown Wolfsbane plant can be harvested to obtain more Wolfsbane seeds and the Wolfsbane flower.%n

This manual covers common problems encountered when using the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace.%n%nSetup%nWhen setting up your EBF, make sure to place it a few chunks away from things pollution affects, like farmland. Pollution is nobody's friend!%n%nDuring setup, make sure the center of the EBF is hollow. Sometimes things can sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft light orb!%n%nMake sure your muffler faces §lout§r, not §lin§r. The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those delightful odors!%n%nWhen placing your power hatches, make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF. Especially at LV, those few blocks make a big difference! Every amp of energy travelling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to get longer running time until you get stable power.%n%nOutput hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and inventories placed next to them such as chests or BC tanks. They will also void if they're full, so keep an eye on them!%n%nWhen building multiple EBFs, the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace can share walls. This can save you on input and output hatches too. Not recommended for energy and maintenance hatches!

Be sure to make paths over water, horses don't like going through deep water. If you get unseated in deep water, you can try getting on repeatedly and moving a small distance each time, this may be faster for small rivers. You can also try jumping over the deep parts if it isn't that big.%n%nIf you are playing single player or a local server, horses make a great way to get around. On nonlocal servers they can cause problems and desync if you have poor internet, or if the server doesn't have good TPS. Like all the official servers.%n%nYou can tie the lead to your horse and the fence to get it to stick around while you investigate something.

Click it or scroll to choose the number you need. If you do that you don't have to insert a physical circuit. This is going to be your main option for all single block machines. This option is now also available for input busses of multiblocks which you will get to in later tiers.%n%nThere are a few places throughout the modpack where you still need the physical circuits. You can turn an LV circuit into a programmed circuit in the crafting grid and then program it in various ways:%n%n1) Find the correct crafting recipe with a screwdriver in NEI and use that.%n%n2) Rightclick while holding the programmed circuit to open an easy menu. You still need to at least have the screwdriver in your inventory though or it won't work. Eventually you can also make an electric screwdriver.%n%n3) Use the BartWorks Circuit Programmer. It is only available in MV. But it does not use any durability and runs on EU.%n%n4) Use the GT++ Circuit Programmer block. It isn't portable and only available in MV.

Some of the lines at the bottom might look simple, but they will require bees further up to complete first. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown here.%n%nBees have two sets of traits, one that is §aActive§r that has effects on how the bee lives, and one §3Inactive§r but can be used for breeding. Some traits are §4Dominant§r, and some are §9Recessive§r. Keep this in mind when trying to breed in or out a new trait. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the targeted bee traits. You can breed the bees with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. You can't see the passive traits using a Field Kit, you'll need a Beealyzer. For lots of bees, you can scan them first using a GT scanner, but you'll still need a Beealyzer to see passive traits.%n%nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee.  A bee that has little or no crossbreeding potential, but has all the traits you prefer - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility, etc.  Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.%n%nWhen you are trying for a new bee, what you are wanting is a drone - this way you can use your "breeding stock" princess for easy breeding, but the drone to get the new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poor crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good for this, since they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let them live longer. Once you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die (they can become ignoble under certain circumstances though, like using tons of production frames). Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits already, and there's a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect them with that.%n%nOnce you get a new species, it will replace all of one of the two sets of traits of the bee. §3If you get the mutation chance success twice on the same bee, it'll replace both active and inactive sets of traits though.§r For example when you get a Cultivated, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated! All the quests will require §6purebred§r species. PS: most effects are useless, so don't worry too much.%n%nAll traits can be bred into any bee species, aside from the species itself. Species also determines the preferred temperature and humidity, as well as drops. Species will require their preferred temerature and humidity to be in 'jubilant' state, and produce their special drops. You can also mimic this with the alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT with tolerances.%n%nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances, or to lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for that pristine princess to become ignoble!%n%nIt looks complex, because it is! But it's also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!

# Quest: Basic Bee Stats
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008a3.name=Basic Bee Stats
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000008a3.desc=There are a couple of basic bees that have good stats you will want to breed into your breeding stock.%n%nCave Dwelling - Rocky - This lets you put the bee housing underneath or inside. Handy for putting a chest on top for products.%n%nNocturnal - Rocky - This keeps your bees working all night long, and in the dark.%n%nRain Tolerant - Water - Keep producing even when it is raining.%n%nHigh Fertility - Wintry - For breeding purposes, you want the maximum number of drones produced.%n%nReminder - Specialty products from bees require Jubilant state. That means the bee is in its §lNATURAL§r preferred climate. So it must not be in a biome it can tolerate due to temp/humidity improvements. For example, a Salt bee needs Warm/Normal climate. Even if it has +- humidity and temp, it will not produce its Salt comb unless it is in a Warm/Normal climate. Use Alveary upgrades to make sure it is in its preferred temp/humidity.

Well the silver nanite isn't rigid enough for that so a new nanite will be needed... and so will new casings. Heard that celestial tungsten is a good candidate for a frame. Quantum can be used for the protection as these nanites will be forever flying around inside.%n%nThe structure will need to change as it needs to be a bit bigger and taller.%n%n§3Works the same as the Tier 2 in most cases, but allows the player to use even less resources by using a gold nanite.

betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c5d.desc=Once you progress enough in ZPM to make ZPM Dynamo Hatches, you can increase each turbine's output to 524,288 EU/t. At this number, you'll be a lot less limited by the turbine material, and it's possible to increase the total power output of one Fusion Reactor considerably. You can cover the total Helium Plasma output from one reactor with 3 Plasma Turbines, if you choose the right materials:%n%nLarge High Durability Compound Steel 230%% 202,860 EU/t%nLarge Atomic Separation Catalyst 200%% 399,672 EU/t%nLarge Adamantium 180%% 170,010 EU/t%nLarge Draconium 170%% 214,200 EU/t (durable)%nLarge Ichorium 170%% 342,720 EU/t (very durable)%nLarge Neutronium 160%% 241,920 EU/t (very durable)%n%nThe power output and final efficiency can vary a lot, based on which turbines you're using. Some of them, like Ichorium and Neutronium, last basically forever, while others will need to be replaced from time to time but offer higher efficiency. If you want to get more power per turbine, to reach closer to the dynamo's limit, you can increase the flow of plasma to the turbine, but be careful! You can't go beyond the dynamo's limit, and you will also lose efficiency as you increase the flow amount.

There's a quest for the other one, the Thorium High Temperature Reactor, on the powergen side of this branch, but this is a diferent multiblock. %n%nIt's called the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR), and it uses fuel pebbles and consumes power. However, it doesn't really make a lot of power, and doesn't even match the EU/t of the other version, despite being much more expensive. The multiblock structure is basically the same, a huge reactor around 12x12x12 blocks in size, with 500+ casings made with Europium. What it doesn't make in power, it compensates in breeding, however.%n%nFor the unaware, this is expensive. Pebble reactors work by stuffing the reactor absolutely full of pebbles, and then the reaction will keep going for, essentially, forever. In this case, you will have a fully automated source of almost endless Lutetium, Plutonium and other things that will be explained in the following quests, alongside the production of fuel and the processing of outputs. What this means is that this is an expensive multiblock, but it's placed a tier in which this expense is actually reasonable, if there is a need for immense, endless breeding of many outputs.%n%nIf you're on the fence about building this, check the next quests to learn more about the fuel and outputs.%n%nNotes:%n%nHTGR has an internal buffer for fuel and only one input bus is required (any will do), as well as only one output bus (reactor automatically compresses every 64 burned pellets into one ball, so you need 6 slots or more to avoid problems with voiding at full capacity).%n%nReactor requires only 72k out of 720k pebbles to operate, but running at minimum capacity means that you will not get any bonuses, such as lower recipe time and higher amount of pebbles processed per cycle.%n%nThis multi consumes 1A LuV when operating, no matter how many pebbles are inside, but it also generates Hot Coolant as it runs. If you use it to generate power, you will gain more EU than is consumed by the reactor. %n%nIn this reactor, the throughput increases with the amount of pebbles put into it.%n%nBy typing HTGR in NEI, you can see all the items that are related to this multiblock.

# Quest: Two Million Turbines
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c73.name=Two Million Turbines
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c73.desc=Hopefully, not more than a handful. The objective here is for each of them to output close to 2 million EU/t.%n%nHow can you get there? Look at the UV Dynamo Hatch's recipe and you have your new objective. When you arrive there, each turbine that is equipped with that impressive block will be able to output up to 2,097,152 EU/t, which again opens you up to new turbine opportunities. Some good choices at this point are as follows:%n%nLarge Cosmic Neutronium 220%% 1,330,560 EU/t%nLarge Awakened Draconium 190%% 478,800 EU/t%nLarge Trinium 180%% 1,452,520 EU/t%n%nAt this point, you might consider building more t1 Fusion Reactors to process other materials. Even if you stop the reactor you're using to generate this plasma, the EU cost of restarting it is less than 1 bucket of plasma, so it's probably not that big of a deal.%n%nMake a normal or buffered UV dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest: Infinite Turbines
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c78.name=Infinite Turbines
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c78.desc=Some turbine materials are not available for you, either because you don't have the material itself or because the Dynamo Hatch in the turbine cannot handle the power output from plasma. It will be a different story in UHV, when you can once again quadruple the max output of each turbine, and also unlock Infinity as an option for turbines.%n%nLarge Infinity 270%% 4,354,560 EU/t%nLarge Infinity Catalyst 200%% 806,400 EU/t%n%nYes, that's basically it. You can use any material from the previous turbine quests, but when you make the t8 rocket and can mine Infinity Catalyst, these are the two options. Obviously, Infinity is much better, but also much more expensive. If you stick with fusion, you will need several of those to push through the endgame. Remember that you can input plasma beyond the optimal flow, and get more out of each turbine at the cost of fuel efficiency.%n%nMake a normal or buffered UHV dynamo to complete the quest.

# Quest: Gas Planets

# Quest: §6§lInfinity Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c91.name=§6§lInfinity Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c91.desc=Smelting with the ferocity of the universe itself.%n%nThis unbelievable material seemed impossible to manipulate into a coil block form, even though its properties made this desirable. It is incredibly stable even at extreme temperatures, but this also made it unable to pack together for coils.%n%nHowever, the situation changed when you thought about using something more intelligent. By integrating a Wetware or better UHV circuit, the Infinity Coil became a reality, controlled by the ever-watching eyes of the circuitry you've spent months to create. From now on, these eyes will watch over your multiblocks.%n%nProvides 11701 heat. You could upgrade your EBF, though at this point it's more likely to be for your MEBFs or your DTPF.

# Quest: §6§lHypogen Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c92.name=§6§lHypogen Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c92.desc=Forged from the blood of an ageless dragon, and melded together by the power of fusion beyond what you thought was the reality. No natural element, or combination of elements, could match up to this glowing orange material, not even the Awakened Draconium you got your hands on before.%n%nWhat truly happened inside that Mk4 Fusion Reactor? What §ois§o§r this material? Its dust pulsates visibly, at different rates depending on the size of the dust itself. Hypogen approaches a state of complete balance as it approaches the block size, and it is obvious to you what needs to be done with it.%n%nIt absorbs and radiates energy without any effort, but it would be stupid to attempt making coils out of this without assistance. Wetware wasn't good enough anymore, and only the most advanced living circuit could withstand the erratic behavior Hypogen demonstrates.%n%nProvides 12601K heat. Almost certainly, this will end up on your DTPF.

# Quest: §6§lEternal Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c93.name=§6§lEternal Coil Upgrade
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000c93.desc=Beyond spacetime, beyond reality. You have peered into what never existed and brought into a fluid, and then a solid. It has been stabilized, against all odds. When you look at it, you think that you could hold the entire universe in your hand.%n%nIn the past, you were able to combine almost all materials into one, through an Eternal Singularity, an infinitely dense sample of the universe. However, automating this at the scale of the DTPF proved ridiculous, which would have stopped your progress altogether if not for the discovery of the Energized Tesseract. To physically manifest spacetime itself, you first needed to manifest the fourth spatial dimension, and that is what the Tesseract is: a 4-dimensional cube.%n%nCubes! Almost everything around you is made out of cubes. You have only glimpsed at the reality of the 4-dimensional world, but you have successfully used it to condensate spacetime, which can be arbitrarily molded into the complete Eternal mixture, a process that unfortunately cannot be reversed. Needless to say, living circuits will not suffice to maintain an infinitely dense, infinitely stable, multi-dimensional material.%n%nCurrently, the final upgrade with 13501K. This really makes your DTPF shine!

# Quest: Nano Forge Tier 1
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ccf.name=Nano Forge Tier 1
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000ccf.desc=There must a be a way to make a nano scale robots to work in a machine. Carbon ones can be made in an assembly line, but very inefficiently. There must be a better way.%n%nWhat about a Nano Forge, able to cut up blocks into nano-thin sheets and then creating the first nanite, which helps create thousands of them in mere seconds.%n%n§3The Nano Forge is a big multiblock requiring lots of power over the course of a couple minutes. It is able to use TT energy hatches (including lasers). The controller must have a carbon nanite to use tier 1 recipes.%n%nDespite what NEI might claim there are no minimum voltages for the Nano Forge recipes. If you want to do a recipe you just have to achieve the raw EU/t required, no matter the voltage.

# Quest: Nano Forge Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd0.name=Nano Forge Tier 2
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd0.desc=Carbon Nanites are good first worker, but they don't have much in the way of working with more complex systems as they have a very basic nanite network. So a new more advanced nanite will be needed to produce complex nanites.%n%nThe neutronium nanite is an in-between of the two tiers able to produce tier 2 nanites, which have other uses.%n%n§3When putting the neutronium nanite in the controller, you will need to wait for the structure check to happen again or break and replace the controller with a neutronium nanite inside. Allows the Nano Forge to make tier 2 nanites.

# Quest: Nano Forge Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd1.name=Nano Forge Tier 3
betterquesting.quest.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000cd1.desc=Neutronium nanites are slow moving, but that allowed them to have a complex nanite network. If there was a material that could move itself it could allow for an even more compex nanite with great speeds... Thankfully with the DTPF fully functional we can make it, transcendent metal.%n%n§3Same thing as the neutronium nanite, but this nanite allows for tier 3 nanites to be made in the nano forge.
