      "desc:8": "With the portable scanner, you can get the crop\u0027s stats and environmental info while it is still in the ground by right-clicking it. It also stays scanned after getting the seed. Look for the portable scanner quest after the EBF in Multiblock Goals. About those stats:\n\n§aGrowth§r:\nHow fast it grows, with higher \u003d faster. Specifically, it increases the growth points your crop gets per growth tick. If it gets to 24+, your crop acts like a weed, so most people say to stay at 23 or less. However, it will only weed other crops under certain conditions.\n\n1) Is in a cardinal direction on the same Y level. 2) Will only affect dirt/grass, or cropsticks or crops 3) If there\u0027s a crop there that is §oalso§r a weed, if it\u0027s at a maturity level \u003e 1, it §owon\u0027t affect it§r 4) If it affects the crop, it\u0027ll be replaced with a normal weed\n\n§9Gain§r:\nInfluences chances of how many drops you get, and whether you get any at all. 31 is the best for sure.\n\n§eResistance§r:\nThis stat is responsible for a couple of crops\u0027 properties: chances for getting a seed while punching crop, resistance of your crop to trampling (jumping on it), decreases chance of crop dying due to lack of enviromental stats, and resistance of crop to weed spread. It also reduces mutation chance as it goes up (apparently). Aim for around 10 for balance.",
