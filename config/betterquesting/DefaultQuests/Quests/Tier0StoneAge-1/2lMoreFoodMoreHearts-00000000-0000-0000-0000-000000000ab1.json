Well, what if I told you you can get extra hearts just by expanding your palate. You get 1 point for every half shank of hunger from a food eaten, and after 50 points, you get 1 extra heart! Now you have a reason to make all those Pam\u0027s foods. Of course, each food only contributes it\u0027s shank value once, no cheating!\n\nIf you want to see what foods you\u0027ve eaten, you can use the (not) handy Food Journal. Realistically though, you\u0027ll want to use NEI to both see foods eaten and not eaten. You can search for \u0027not yet eaten\u0027 to see foods left, and \u0027assisted\u0027 to see foods eaten. You need to have started diminishing returns first to see this.\n\n§3If it doesn\u0027t work for you, try the following. First, go to NEI options in the bottom left when the inventory is open, then click on inventory, and change Search Mode to Regex. Then restart your client, and try searching again.§r\n\nThere are also two commands:\n\n/foodlist size\nWill tell you total progress, and progress to next heart.\n\n/foodlist sync \u003cPlayerName\u003e\nIs to sync with the server if it gets out of sync."
