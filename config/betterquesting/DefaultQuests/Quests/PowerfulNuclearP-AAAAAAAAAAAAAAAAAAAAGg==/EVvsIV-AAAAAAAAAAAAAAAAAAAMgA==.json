Similarly, your ability to put together the multiblocks needed for the fluid nuke will be better in IV, since you can mine Small Titanium Ore directly, and use GT++ multis. \n\nAll in all, it becomes very worthwhile to rush the Tier 2 Rocket and land on Mars and Phobos to get Uranium and Tungstate/Scheelite, before you go much farther with IC2 nukes. In IV, fluid nukes are one of the best choices for efficient power without a lot of setup, although it\u0027s very viable to use Thorium and not just Uranium.\n\nEither way, it\u0027s recommended to have a multiblock Miner in either the Nether or Phobos, to source your Thorium or Uranium."
