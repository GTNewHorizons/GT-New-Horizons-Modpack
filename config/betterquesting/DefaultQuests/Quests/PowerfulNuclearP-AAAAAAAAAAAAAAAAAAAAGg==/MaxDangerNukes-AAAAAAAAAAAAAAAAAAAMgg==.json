      "desc:8": "Were you courageous enough to build a vac nuke? If so, are you courageous enough to do it in a MOX setup, with high heat?\n\nYes, this is possible, and extremely powerful. However, all the risks you signed up for are exponentially increased, since MOX nukes keep getting better and better the closer the nuke\u0027s temperature is to the critical point. This sort of automation is more complicated than almost any other, and there are very few tutorials for exploiting the maximum potential of these setups. Here are some links you might find useful:\n\n[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dBmwZZ7Z_n-g[/url]\n\nTutorial video for automation of dangerous vacuum nukes. 43,600 EU/t for Uranium, 108,895 EU/t for MOX at 99% heat, 4,979,200 EU/t for The Core.\n\n[url]https://discord.com/channels/181078474394566657/1341554447981219880[/url]\n\n#tips-and-tricks post about the setup in the video above, with more details and discussion.\n\n[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dN4iO1HlFvVQ[/url]\n\nAnother video about vacuum nuke setups.",
