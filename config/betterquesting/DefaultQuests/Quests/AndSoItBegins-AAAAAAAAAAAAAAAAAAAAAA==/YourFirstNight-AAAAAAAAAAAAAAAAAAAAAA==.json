It probably would be a good idea to collect some food now...\n\n§lNote: You don\u0027t need to keep this book, you can use tilde to open quests without the book.§r ...if your keybinds don\u0027t conflict.\n\nGo to the Discord server at §1§n[url]https://discord.gg/gtnh[/url]§r for help outside of what the questbook offers, or just to hang out. Select an appropriate role in #role-select to get tier-appropriate advice.\n\nWe also maintain a wiki at §1§n[url]https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page[/url]§r. Be sure to check it out. Some of the stuff is really complicated, and needs more text to explain than the QB can do. Also, pictures. Also, beginner\u0027s guides for some stuff if you don\u0027t think the questbook is enough. There\u0027s also a list of optional mods for people that want to be even fancier, or use different fonts or w/e.\n\nAdditionally, there\u0027s the spreadsheet at §1§n[url]http://bit.ly/gtnh-datasheets[/url]§r for info that you would would want a spreadsheet for.\n\nLastly, if you got the pack from §4Curse§r, please be aware that it doesn\u0027t always work properly (Curse doesn\u0027t play well with all the customized versions of mods we have), so if you have any problems, the first response on how to fix it will be to switch to another launcher like §9MultiMC§r, §5Prism Launcher§r, or §aTechnic§r. The latest version is available on the discord channel from #announcements or with the !download command.\n\n§3Hopefully you didn\u0027t get munched by a monster while reading this.\n\nAnd yes, the links are clickable."
