      "desc:8": "There are several AE items that aren\u0027t particularly useful, but probably deserve mention, so here they are:\n\nCertus Tanks: They hold 32B and are portable and easy to make.\n\nView Cell: Format in a Cell Workbench to filter what you see in a terminal (when they\u0027re installed in it)\n\nCertus/Nether Quartz Cutting Knifes: Right-click to open interface and choose a name. The press can be used in the Inscriber to name stuff without using an anvil. You can also rename p2p tunnels and interfaces in world with the knife.\n\nME Block Container: Holds only one type of item, but the amount of a 64k drive. Can place the item in world, or replace in a 1x1 or 3x3 area. Blocks replaced will be dumped in world. This will be horizontal or vertical depending on which side of a block you select. Shift-right-click air to change mode, right-click a block to activate mode.\n\nCharged Quartz Fixture: Emits light at the same level as a torch, but fancier.\n\nLight Detecting Fixture: Emits redstone signal based on light. Since it only starts at 7, it\u0027s not as useful as the Light Sensor.\n\nME Upgrade (Tier 1/2/3): If you\u0027re an OC person, there are 3 upgrades you can make to add access to your network from robots and drones.\nT1: 0.5 access point range\nT2: Normal access point range\nT3: Unlimited range, any dim\n\nEntropy Manipulator: Changes grass/dirt/dried dirt into each other, or starts fires. Or melts ice. Useless.\n\nMatter Cannon: Shoots Matter Balls made in the Matter Condensor. Put it in an ME Chest or Drive and put items in a Terminal to fill. Decent I guess? But it destroys blocks every time you use it, so... Well, I guess you could use it with Paint Balls?\n\nColor Applicator: Use dye items or Paint Balls (more efficient) to dye stuff. You can dye cables, or anything Forge-compatible, like wool or glass. Place items inside like the Matter Cannon. You can cycle through the colors by holding shift and right-clicking, or scrolling the mouse wheel. If you use snow balls, you can remove paint instead. You can also use it in a dispensor.\n\nWalrus: It\u0027s a walrus, what were you expecting?",
