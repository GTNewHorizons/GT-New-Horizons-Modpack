      "desc:8": "§rThese cards add additional functionality to certain devices or fixtures. They specify what devices they work on in the tooltip.\n\n§6Redstone Card:§r\n\n§rThe Redstone Card adds redstone interactivity to the devices it can be used on, with the following options:§r\n\n§cAlways active\nActive with redstone signal\nActive without redstone signal\nActivate once per pulse\n\n§r§6Capacity Card: §f\n\n§rThe Capacity Card adds more slots for items that use them. \n\n§rIf you add this to an Export Bus, an icon is added to select item priority.\n\n§6Crafting Card: §f\n\n§rThe Crafting Card allows you to automatically request autocrafting of items.\n\n§9In an ME Interface:§f\n\n§rIf you put in items to be stocked, if there aren\u0027t enough, it\u0027ll craft them until it reaches the selected amount. \n\n§rThese crafts are being stocked for recipes that the ME Interface has.§r\n\n[note]If you want them to be seen by the network, you\u0027ll need to put a storage bus on the ME Interface.[/note]\n\n§9In an ME Level Emitter:\n\n§e§aFirst Mode:§f§r §UIt\u0027ll emit a redstone signal while the specific item is being crafted.§r\n\n§e§aSecond Mode:§r§r§r§r It will emit a redstone signal once a crafting job for the item has been requested,§r [warn]but it won\u0027t send the items to be crafted.[/warn] \n\n§rThis is useful if you\u0027re using a dummy pattern, and are using the level emitter to tell something else to happen. \n\n§rYou still need to get the item(s) requested back into the system so it doesn\u0027t tie up a crafting CPU though.\n\n§9In an ME Export Bus:§f\n\n§rIt\u0027ll attempt to send whatever item(s) are selected in the export bus\u0027 GUI.\n\n§e§aFirst Mode:§f§r It\u0027ll§r send available items first, then create crafting jobs for the rest. \n\n§e§aSecond Mode:§f§r It will only send crafted items.\n\n§6Acceleration Card:§f\n\n§rThe Acceleration Card makes the device/fixture work faster. \n\n§r[note]You\u0027ll probably want a lot of these.[/note]\n\n§6Inverter Card:§f\n\n§rThe Inverter Card allows you to invert the item filter of certain fixtures.\n\n§6Fuzzy Card:§f\n\n§rThe Fuzzy Card allows you to apply fuzzy logic to filtering to allow items with different NBT or damage data to be counted as the same. This is different from metadata. \n\n§rIf you just want it to be fuzzy for NBT, set to §9Match Any.§f§f \n\n§rIf it is set to §c99%§f§r, it will work on anything that is damaged. You can use the Inverter Card to reverse this.",
