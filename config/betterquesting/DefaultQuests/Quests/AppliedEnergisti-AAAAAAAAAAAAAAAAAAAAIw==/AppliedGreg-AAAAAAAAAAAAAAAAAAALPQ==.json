      "desc:8": "ME Buses are combination of technology and...other technology. Don\u0027t give me that look, it is, OK? With these, you can now directly I/O items between GregTech multiblock and ME network. They have §osignificantly§r less lag, so please start using them as soon as possible on servers.\n\nYou just pop off your GT bus + ME bus or ME interface combination, and replace both with the new bus and connect a ME cable directly to it. It uses 1 channel, same as the other options.\n\nThe output bus and hatch have limited output space. If you need more, you can upgrade them either by crafting them with storage components or putting a cell inside. A digital singularity cell will make the cache near infinite.\n\nNote that the output bus must eject each item from its cache §oin order§r. If it cannot eject the topmost item, it will be stuck and cannot eject any other items.\n\nIf voiding is turned off, the multiblock will not void when the ME Outputs are full.\n\n[note]For usage in some machines, i.e. the advanced assembly line, the configured item must be in the first slot in order for the multi to work.[/note]",
