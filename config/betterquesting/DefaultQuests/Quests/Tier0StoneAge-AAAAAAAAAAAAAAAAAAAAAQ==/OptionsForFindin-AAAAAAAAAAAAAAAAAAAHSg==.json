Search for Small Zinc Ore in the overworld\n2. Use the recipe with XP buckets in a crafting table\n3. Buy the Zinc Gravel Ore in the Vending Machine (Unlocked later in this tab!)\n\n[note]Once you reach LV, you can get Zinc from processing various ores like Antimony, Sphalerite, Tetrahedrite and Tin. You will also be able to macerate the gravel ore for twice the product so save what you can until then![/note]",
