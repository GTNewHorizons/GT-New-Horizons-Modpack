Go and become a dangerous wizard and you\u0027ll gain the power needed to craft the Ball of Moss and make your tools heal themselves. Of course, you need to get to the Twilight Forest and get some aluminium ingots before you can begin. The Ball of Moss is in the GTNH tab of the Thauminomicon, and requires infusion.\n\nHave a beer to prepare for your long journey.\n\n§3If you really want to see recipe now, you can go to Mod Options \u003e Thamcraft NEI Additions \u003e Config \u003e general \u003e showLockedRecipes and set to true. Note that this is disabled by default... for reasons."
