Can also disconnect/connect pipes or enable their built in shutter.\n\n§lCrowbar§r - Remove covers from machines or pipes.\n\n§lWire cutters§r - Connecting/disconnecting/breaking wires/cables.\n\n§lSoft mallet§r - Turning machines on/off.\n\n§lHammer§r - Prospecting for ores in a limited way in front of you, smashing ore blocks into crushed ores, and muffling machine sounds.\n\n§lPlunger§r - Drain fluids from a machine or tank\n\n[note]On a side note, Tin Pipes need a Steel Wrench to dismantle, so don\u0027t place them randomly, and pay attention to material levels![/note]",
