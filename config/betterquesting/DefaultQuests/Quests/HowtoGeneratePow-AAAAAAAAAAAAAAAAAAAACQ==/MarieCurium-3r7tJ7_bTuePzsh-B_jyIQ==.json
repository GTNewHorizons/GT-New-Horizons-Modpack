This goes to you, Marie and Pierre Curie.\n\nThis is the only non-plasma produced in a fusion reaction in this entire chain. That\u0027s not the important part, though: the important part is that [warn]this is one of the bottlenecks of the chain.[/warn] For every reactor running the final recipe, you will need around 0.144 reactors of this, so you won\u0027t make it to a compact at the end with just one mk1 reactor. Expect to follow the count of the second-to-last recipe, the Advanced Nitinol one.",
