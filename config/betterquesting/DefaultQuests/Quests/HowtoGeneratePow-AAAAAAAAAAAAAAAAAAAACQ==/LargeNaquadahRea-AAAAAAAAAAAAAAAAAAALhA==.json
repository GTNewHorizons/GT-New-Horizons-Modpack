You can see the liquid fuel infomation in NEI.\n\nIt consumes 2400 L/s liquid air when running, otherwise it will keep consuming your fuel without outputting power.\n\n[warn]It will explode with more than one types of fuel in its hatches.[/warn]\n\nYou can input in coolant to increase efficiency.\nIC2 Coolant: 1.05x\nSuper Coolant: 1.5x\nCryotheum: 2.75x\nTachyon Rich Temporal Fluid: 5.00x \n\nYou can also input molten metals to increase power.\nMolten Caesium: 2x\nMolten Uranium-235: 3x\nMolten Naquadah: 4x\nMolten Atomic Separation Catalyst: 16x\nSpatially Enlarged Fluid: 64x\nNote: It will consume more fuel to match the output power, unlike coolant which directly increases the power. The molten metal works like \u0027parallels\u0027 for your reactor.\n\nIt also supports §9Tec§1Tech§r\u0027s Multi-Amp Dynamo hatches and laser hatches.\n\n[note]PS: This generator has the highest output power in this pack currently, even ahead of the Dyson with Mark VI fuels.[/note]"
