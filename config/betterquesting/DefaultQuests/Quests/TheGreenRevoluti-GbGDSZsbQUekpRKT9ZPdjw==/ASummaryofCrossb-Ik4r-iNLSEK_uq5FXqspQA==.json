If all parents have fertilizer in them, stat loss is prevented. (0 -\u003e +4)\r\n\nDeterministic breeding is similar to how bees work, where you must bring the right species together.\r\nSome situations require more than two parents.\r\nAdvanced crops (above MV materials) will require the breeding machine.\n\nLow-ish-tier crops will also have access to breeding pools, where similar crops may be bred with others of the same “type” to produce other similar crops.",
