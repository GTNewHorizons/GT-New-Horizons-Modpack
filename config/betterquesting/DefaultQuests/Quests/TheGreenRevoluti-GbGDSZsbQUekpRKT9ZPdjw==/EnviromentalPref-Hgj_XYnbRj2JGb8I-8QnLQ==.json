      "desc:8": "Instead of just using a biome-based modifier for nutrients and humidity, a crop will look for the tags of the biome it’s in and apply a modifier based on the number of “favoured” tags found in the biome.\r\n\nHaving the proper biome tags will provide a significant “nutrient” boost to your crops, resulting in a noticeable effect on growth speed. (+14 nutrient points per tag)\r\nYou can only benefit from up to 2 biome tags.\r\nIt is still possible to simulate up to 1 preferred biome tag by planting your crops in a high-humidity (80%+) location.\r\nThe bonus scales linearly with humidity between 50% and 80%.\r\nValues below 50% will not provide any bonuses.\r\nValues above 80% will cap the bonus at the equivalent of 1 preferred biome tag.\r\nIf any favoured biome tag is present in the current biome, the high humidity bonus will be ignored.\r\n",
