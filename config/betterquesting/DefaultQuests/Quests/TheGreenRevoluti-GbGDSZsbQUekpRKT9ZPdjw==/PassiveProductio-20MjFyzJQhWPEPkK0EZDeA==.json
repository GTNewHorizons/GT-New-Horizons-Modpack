      "desc:8": "One of the main reasons for getting into CropsNH is the passive production of resources. \r\n\r\nThe crops attached to this quest will generally provide you the direct resource you are looking for. This can be perfect for getting that extra bit of aluminium you need to push through MV, or for generating a passive amount of basic minerals long before any other techniques become available.\n\nKeep in mind the under-soil requirements for these crops especially. To passively produce aluminum, you will first need blocks of aluminum or bauxite ore.",
