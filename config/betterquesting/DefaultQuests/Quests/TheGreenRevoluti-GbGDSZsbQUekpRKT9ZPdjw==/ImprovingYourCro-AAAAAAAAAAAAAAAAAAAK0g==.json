There is always a chance for this to occur whenever a new crop grows - whether by self propogation or crossing...\r\n\r\n\r\n§aGrowth§r:\n- How fast it grows, with higher \u003d faster. Specifically it increases the growth points your crop gets per tick. If it gets to 24+, your crop acts like a weed, so make sure you increase that resistance stat in parralel.\r\n\r\n§9Gain§r:\r\r\n- With higher levels of gain, you get more when you harvest your crops! Pretty self explanitory.\r\n\r\n§eResistance§r:\r\r\n- A resistance of 10 will guarantee a seed drop with a spade\r. 20 and 30 will drop 2 or 3 seeds, respectively. A resistance of 31 will guarantee a seed drop without a spade.\r\n\r\n- If the Growth stat is greater than 23, resistance will help prevent weeds from spreading. \rA resistance of 31 will stop the crop from spreading weeds entirely.",
