      "desc:8": "Time for a second EBF! \n\nYou can make ingots faster in 3 ways - better coils, higher tier energy hatches, or adding more furnaces. It\u0027s probably time to add a second EBF to your base.\n\nMultiblock machines can share casings, mufflers, and input/output hatches/busses, but not maintenance hatches (you can share the auto ones though). You can share energy hatches, but only if you can supply enough power to all machines it\u0027s a part of. So if you have two EBFs that both want MV power, and you use a MV Energy Hatch, it won\u0027t work, since neither will get enough power. This is almost never used, so don\u0027t worry about it. Also, if you want to share inputs on Processing Arrays, turn off recipe map filtering on the busses.\n\nRemember, pollution will be very high with two EBFs active at once! Watch out for high pollution effects. Use the best mufflers available and don\u0027t place the EBFs in the same chunk as farmland or other high pollution machines like Pyrolyse Ovens and Large Boilers.\n\nYou can use whatever coils you have lying around, but you might want to start searching for Mica if you haven\u0027t found any yet."
