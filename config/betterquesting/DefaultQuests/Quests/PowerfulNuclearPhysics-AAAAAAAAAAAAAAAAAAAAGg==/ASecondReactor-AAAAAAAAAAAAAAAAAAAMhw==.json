You should be a in a better position to afford it, but there is the issue that t3 fusion unlocks an easier Americium recipe, which lets you craft a second t3 more easily. You might not want to wait that long, maybe you\u0027ve been smelting a lot of ingots, or using World Accelerators?\n\nRegardless, two Helium Plasma reactors will surely suffice for whatever it is you\u0027re doing. Tin Plasma is worth using, of course, but the Molecular Transformer recipe to convert Silver to Tin isn\u0027t available in the singleblock anymore, so you might want the easier option, since you\u0027re rocking two reactors and all. With the 2x overclock they\u0027re still produce millions of EU/t with the right Plasma Turbines, assuming you have them ready."
