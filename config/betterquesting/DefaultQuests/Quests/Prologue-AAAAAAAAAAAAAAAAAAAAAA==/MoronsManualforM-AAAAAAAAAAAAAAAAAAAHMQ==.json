Unlike in vanilla, a player has to actually stay aware and pay attention to what they are fighting. Here are some tips.\n\nIf an infernal has Vengeance, don\u0027t shoot it with your 56-damage crossbow!\n\nA high health infernal with regeneration is hard to kill. Even worse if it is a witch that can also heal herself. In those cases, run like hell, or bring a soul vial to capture it and throw it into Mount Doom.\n\nWatch out for zombies with fishing poles - they can pull you to them. And zombies with a bow and arrow - they can shoot you back!",
