      "desc:8": "Aka the Mega Apiary.\n\nIt has three primary modes (change with screwdriver) and two operation modes (change with shift+screwdriver):\n\nINPUT MODE: Does not take power. Put your queens in the input bus to put them in the internal buffer.\n\nOUTPUT MODE: Does not take power. Will give your bees back to the output bus.\n\nOPERATING MODE - NORMAL: The processing time is 5 seconds. Uses 1 Amp LuV per queen. All bees are affected by 64x acceleration and 8 Production Upgrades as well as a Genetic Stabilizer Upgrade. The IAADDS also simulates a perfect environment for all bees.\n\nYou can provide royal jelly to increase the outputs. 1 royal jelly grants 5% bonus per bee. They will be consumed on each start of operation and be applied to that operation only. The maximum bonus is 200%. The normal bee stats still apply of course, though the IAADDS is able to provide a perfect environment for any bee.\n\nOPERATING MODE - SWARMER: In this mode you can only insert 1 queen. The IAADDS will then slowly produce ignoble princesses for 100 royal jelly per operation. The base processing time is 1 minute but you can overclock this process. The base usage is 1 Amp IV.\n\n§3Yes you need thousands of queens, not princesses."
