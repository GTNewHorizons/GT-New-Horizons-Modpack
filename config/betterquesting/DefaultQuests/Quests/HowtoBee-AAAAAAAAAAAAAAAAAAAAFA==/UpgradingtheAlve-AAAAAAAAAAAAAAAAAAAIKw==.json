      "desc:8": "These basic upgrades to the Alveary make it more powerful.\n\nFrame Housing - Automation-enabled frame slot for the Alveary. Uses §55 durability§r every bee tick (27s). If it runs out on that tick, it has no effect.\nAlveary Stabilizer - Prevents the bees from mutating into another species. Ideal for breeding traits into a line.\nAlveary Transmission - Power input for upgrades that use power.\nHatchery - Hatches larval bees for use in Genetics or to create additional drones. Not used for Gendustry stuff.\nAlveary Sieve - Instead of the pollen from a bee fertilizing a nearby tree, it is stored here and can be manually applied. Requires manually placing woven silk in the inventory.\nSwarmer - Creates additional Ignoble queens in hives around the Alveary. These are genetic copies of the original. This uses royal jelly or aromatic lumps. The latter are more effective.\n\n[note]Note that all upgrade blocks must be in the bottom 2 layers. The center block also cannot be an upgrade block, though the bottom center can.[/note]\n\n[warn]When using power, the transmission block will suck down entire amps to fill a tiny amount. Use the EIO capacitors or something similar to prevent this.[/warn]",
