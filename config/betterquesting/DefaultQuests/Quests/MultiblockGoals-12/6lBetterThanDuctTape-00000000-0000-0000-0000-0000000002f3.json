Valid soldering materials are fine wires, rods, and ingots made from either tin, lead, or soldering alloy. The soldering iron will consume the first such material it finds in the player\u0027s inventory. Since you\u0027ll likely have more than enough, Fine Wires of Soldering Alloy are probably best.\n\nYou can also use it to adjust the redstone strength from weak to strong emitted by GT machines.\n\nAlso, while holding it all pipes, wires, and cables will look very small, so that you can see everything past them, and also be sure of the exact connections.\n\nIn order to \"complete\" the quest you\u0027ll need to charge the soldering iron after you craft it.\n\nFor the other problems other tools are necessary.\n\nPossible problems                Tool to fix\n\"Pipe is loose.\"                    Wrench\n\"Screws are loose.\"           Screwdriver \n\"Something is stuck.\"            Soft Mallet \n\"Platings are dented.\"           Hammer \n\"Circuitry burned out.\"    Soldering Iron \n\"That doesn\u0027t belong there.\"   Crowbar"
