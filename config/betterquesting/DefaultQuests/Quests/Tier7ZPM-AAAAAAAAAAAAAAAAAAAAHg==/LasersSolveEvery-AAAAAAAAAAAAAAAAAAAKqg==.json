      "desc:8": "Laser hatches are a high-end way of sending lots of amps of power, so much in fact, that it starts at 256A. This goes 1024/4096/16384+ and continues from there. They\u0027re also so powerful that only a few machines support them outside of the ever §owonderful§r TecTech: LSC, MBF, MVF, and PSS. Remember to paint the Laser Vacuum Pipes, the Source Hatch, and the Target Hatch. Also, Source \u003d Output, Target \u003d Input. Laser Vacuum Pipes do not split or bend, to turn your laser use [note]Active Transformer[/note]. Later on you can use Laser Vacuum Mirror to bend your Laser Vacuum Pipes, this will however not allow splitting.\n\n[note]Laser hatches can have their operational amperage adjusted in their GUI.[/note]\n\n[warn]Be careful with using very high amp hatches as every Laser Hatch has 1EU/s * max amps passive power loss. For example, a 256A Laser Source Hatch and 256A Laser Target Hatch will both lose 256 EU/s regardless of the amount of power flowing through.[/warn]",
