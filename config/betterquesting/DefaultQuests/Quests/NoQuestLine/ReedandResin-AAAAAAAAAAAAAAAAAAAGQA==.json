      "desc:8": "One of the first useful crops you\u0027ll get is Stickreed. It\u0027s fast growing, and can produce sticky resin and sugarcane (harvest before it reaches full maturity). It\u0027s also great for crossing with other crops to raise their stats. One of the best strategies is to get these to around 20/31/10, then breed out from there. Most people will say 23/31/10, but 24+ act like weeds, so it\u0027s better to have some wiggle room.\n\nI\u0027ll trade you some fertilizer for 2 stacks of each.\n\n[note]PS, you don\u0027t really need rubber trees if you can get these.[/note]\n\n[note]You\u0027ll need a Basic Scanner to scan your Stickreed seeds once you get them, though any set of stats will work. See the quest in LV, and note it requires MV circuits.[/note]",
