      "desc:8": "You might already have a Steam Multiblock or the Large Sifter. But in EV, IV, and the following tiers you unlock multiblocks for (almost) every GT machine. And some more on top of that!\n\nMost of them are made to do the same GT processing as the singleblock machines you\u0027ve been using, but much faster. The multis can have up to three bonuses: energy savings, faster recipe time and parallels, which mean that a single recipe cycle can craft multiple items at once, if the power provided is enough to sustain it.\n\nThe variety of structures and intricacies of these new multis can go far beyond simpler multis like the EBF, LCR or VF. While some are simple cuboids, others come with more diverse mechanics and conditions to work properly. In return, they can be extremely powerful, so keep an eye out for them!",
