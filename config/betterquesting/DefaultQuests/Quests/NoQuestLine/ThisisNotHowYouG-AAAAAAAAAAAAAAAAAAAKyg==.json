      "desc:8": "This produces power out of Rocket Fuels. To see how to make them, look at the Space Race tab. These are specifically GT++ Rocket Fuels, and automating them for powergen in this multi will also provide you with endless fuel for your space travels.\n\nThe math regarding the Rocketdyne is complicated. Looking at the controller\u0027s tooltip helps, but the main gist of it is like this: provide Carbon Dioxide and make sure it doesn\u0027t run out, choose the EU/t you want to get, calculate the amount of fuel you need for the fuel you will use, and then provide enough Liquid Hydrogen to boost the multi, according to the EU/t value.\n\nYou will always want to have the Rocketdyne boosted, for several reasons. Assuming you have at least a buffered IV Dynamo Hatch, outputting close to the maximum on that hatch will lower the fuel efficiency, but not if it\u0027s boosted. Additionally, this multi doesn\u0027t consume fuel continuously, but with intervals of 1 second between consuming and not consuming, while generating power all the same. Boosting this consumption results in huge fuel efficiency, combined with the high fuel values of the Rocket Fuels.",
