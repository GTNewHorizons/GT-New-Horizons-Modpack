      "desc:8": "Taglock Kits are used to collect taglocks from other players or creatures. Taglocks, such as locks of hair, fingernail clippings or blood, are used in various recipes to create a link between the creature and the magic.\n\nUse a taglock kit on a creature, or the used bed of a player, to collect some taglocks from that being. Repeated use on the same bed will cycle taglocks for each player who has used that bed. The kit can also be used on a Leech Chest to collect taglocks from users who have opened the chest or on a Blood Rose to collect the taglock of the player that walked over it.\n\nShift-clicking on any bed will fill the kit with the current players taglocks.\n\nCollecting taglocks by using the kit on a player has a chance of failing and informing the other player what you were trying to do. To increase the chance of collecting a taglock from a player, sneak, and prefer approaching from behind.\n\nTaglocks can only be collected from players who are logged into the same world.\n\nTaglock kits are made by crafting a Glass Bottle with a Bone Needle.",
