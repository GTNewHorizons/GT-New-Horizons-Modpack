      "desc:8": "The Bee House can be used to stabilize mutations, for example if you have successfully bred two different bees, but the passive traits are different from the active ones.\n\nTo actually breed those together to get a new species, you\u0027ll need something different - the Apiary. Building them will require a Carpenter and Impregnated frames, along with Seed Oil and Creosote - quite a bit of industrialization! Or, if you\u0027re lucky, you can find a beekeeper villager to trade with. Maybe you can help the villagers §lget lucky§r to make more beekeeper villagers? If only Cupid and his bow were around...\n\nProduction rates in an empty Apiary are low - lower than a Bee House by quite a bit, in fact. But the Apiary has two big advantages - Frames, and Automation. You can now use your Untreated or Impregnated frames in here to boost output - and the boost is multiplied. So 3 x2 frames gives you 2 * 2 * 2 \u003d 8x extra output! You can also automate I/O for the bees and their products, though not frames unfortunately.\n\nBees also don\u0027t live as long as in a Bee House, but that\u0027s actually a good thing.\n\nAlso, you should check the Genetics mod for useful machines. The Acclimatiser can give very picky bees a much wider temperature or humidity tolerance without having to breed it into them.",
