      "desc:8": "Tired of searching all over the map for that Bamboo Forest or Tropical Rainforest? Desperate for clay dust and need to find a Canyon or Mesa biome? Nature\u0027s compass will lead you to the biome you\u0027re looking for, if it\u0027s within its range.\n\nThe compass menu has the following functionality:\n* When Sorted By: Name, you can filter the list by name or its parts. The search is case-insensitive.\n* You can search by keys and their combinations. For instance, name: bamboo, climate: warm, bh: -1.8, tag: forest.\nAll available keys are:\nname,\nclimate [hellish, hot, warm, normal, cold, icy],\nbaseheight | bh (float, can be negative),\nheightvariation | hv (float),\nrainfall | rain (float),\ntemperature | temp (float),\nhumidity [damp, normal, arid],\ntags.\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n* Biomes from other dimensions show up on the list, don\u0027t bother searching for those unless you\u0027re in that dimension.\n* In general, the full list has biomes that are not generated by Realistic World Generator, like Sunflower Plains.\n* Radius 10000 means it couldn\u0027t find the biome. In this case after the initial search, its menu will show only the biomes in the 10k radius. Use Shift+RMB to see the whole list again.\n* You can try again at a different location - the range is 10k from your current position.\n* Artificially created biomes count, so remove them if you want to find a natural one.\n* There\u0027s lots of different \u0027versions\u0027 of biomes under the same category, so if you want a tropical one for tropical bees, there are actually a bunch of places you can get it.\n* For those who don\u0027t mind the freeze when searching, the radius can be changed in a config. The HUD position can also be changed in the config.",
