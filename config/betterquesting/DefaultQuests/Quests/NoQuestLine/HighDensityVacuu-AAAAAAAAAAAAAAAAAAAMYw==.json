      "desc:8": "Throw more U238 at it!\n\nIf you ever thought that a vacuum nuke doesn\u0027t burn through Uranium fast enough, this one is for you. High Density Uranium, or HDU, outputs twice the EU of the regular Uranium rods, and lasts for 70000 seconds instead of 20000. The heat output, like mentioned before, is the same, so the actual effect of using these rods in a vacuum nuke setup is that your final EU/t per nuke is multiplied by 2, and rods will need to be replaced less often, but the U238 consumption per cycle is a lot higher.\n\nThis also helps if you aren\u0027t automating the fuel rod input, since each one lasts longer. It\u0027s better if it\u0027s automated, but there\u0027s no danger of explosions if this part is done manually, so it\u0027s technically safe, as long as your EU buffer doesn\u0027t start complaining from lack of input.\n\nAs the last step before using The Core, you have High Density Plutonium. This HDP has MOX-like behavior, so it can output even more EU/t than HDU, up to several LuV amps per nuke, but you need to keep it running at high temperatures, which means even more risk! There is no such thing as too much safety, if you try to put one of these together.",
