      "desc:8": "ME Buses are combination of technology and...other technology. Don\u0027t give me that look, it is, ok? With these, you can now directly I/O items between GregTech multiblock and ME network. They have §osignificantly§r less lag, so please start using them as soon as possible on servers.\n\nYou just pop off your GT bus + ME bus or ME interface combination, and replace both with the new bus and connect a ME cable directly to it. It uses 1 channel, same as the other options.\n\nThe output bus and hatch have limited output space. If you need more, you can upgrade them either by crafting them with storage components or putting a cell inside. A digital singularity cell will make the cache near infinite.\n\nIf voiding is turned off, the multiblock will not void when the ME Outputs are full.\n\n[note]For usage in some machines, i.e. the advanced assembly line, the configured item must be in the first slot in order for the multi to work.[/note]",
