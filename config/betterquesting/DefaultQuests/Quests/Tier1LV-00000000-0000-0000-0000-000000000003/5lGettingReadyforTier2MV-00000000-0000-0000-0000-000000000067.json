      "desc:8": "In order to proceed forward, you need to get aluminium. A lot of it. But for now, 8 is enough to complete this quest.\n\nYour first option is alumina dust. Probably the best source for alumina is clay or hardened clay from canyons, however you need an MV machine for that, so you need to find an alternative until you have enough dust for your initial setup. For now, you can get it by centrifuging various impure piles from your ores or by smelting ruby, sapphire, or green sapphire in an EBF with carbon. Check the EBF quest in the Multiblock Goals.\n\nYou will also need an EBF to turn the alumina into aluminium ingots. For that you need cryolite. Go visit the Twilight Forest for that and find a Galena vein.\n\nYour second option is to use aluminium dust. However, you can not smelt that directly yet, even if you have an EBF. That will require higher heat levels. For now, you will have to either use a Tinker\u0027s Smeltery or a GT Compressor to turn the dust into raw aluminium which you can then smelt into ingots in the EBF. Check out the Tier 0 quest for some options to obtain the dust. \n\nBy the time you\u0027ve completed this, you\u0027ll probably be done with most of the tab, but you\u0027ll still need Good Circuits (MV) to actually open up the next tier if you haven\u0027t done that yet.\n\n§3Also check the Armor and Jetpacks tab for new unlocks.\nNote: If you were exploring Twilight Forest before 2.1.1.4 you won\u0027t find any cryolite in existing veins. You\u0027ll need to explore new chunks.\nCheck out the the Lead, Galena, Silver and Cryolite quest in the Novice Thaumaturgy Tab."
