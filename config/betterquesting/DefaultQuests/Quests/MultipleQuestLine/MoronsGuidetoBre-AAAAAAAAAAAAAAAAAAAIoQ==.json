      "desc:8": "First off, don\u0027t be scared by the massive amounts of bees you see here once you unlock the breeding trees. There\u0027s even more that aren\u0027t included and you\u0027ll need NEI to find!\n\nHa ha, just kidding - don\u0027t panic! The breeding lines unlock bit by bit showing you what you can go for next, mostly from the top to the bottom. The large icons represent particularly powerful bees. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown on the Bee Breeding Tree.\n\nBees have two sets of traits, active and inactive. The active one affects the behavior of the bee while the inactive one is only relevant for breeding.\n\nEvery trait further either [warn]Dominant[/warn] or §9Recessive§r, normally respectively colored red and blue. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the desired traits. You can breed the ones with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. A Field Kit or GT scanner cannot see passive traits, you need a Beealyzer for that.\n\nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee - a bee that has little to no crossbreeding potential but has all the traits you want - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4x fertility, and so on. Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.\n\nWhen you are trying to get new species, what you want is a drone - this way you can use your \"breeding stock\" princess with the drone to get new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poorly-crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don\u0027t have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good to swap traits because they\u0027re mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let them live longer.\n\nOnce you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die, but they can become Ignoble under certain circumstances like using tons of production frames. Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits, and there\u0027s a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect them with that.\n\nTurning two different species traits into a third species trait is a §omutation§r. Merely turning one species into another is not. The chance of this happening is shown in the bee breeding tab, as well as the conditions. Bees can require things like blocks underneath their structure, certain moon phases, or other things nearby in order for the mutation to happen at all. Mutations happen across Active-Inactive and Inactive-Active pairs. So if you have an A:B princess that you want to turn into a C:C princess, you want to use an A:B drone. This crosses the princess\u0027 active A with the drone\u0027s inactive B, and the princess\u0027 inactive B with the drone\u0027s active A. This gives a shot at mutation for both the active and inactive traits for the resulting princess and drones.\n\nA new bee mutant is considered \"pure\" or \"purebred\" when both the active and inactive traits are the new species. This is what you need to complete the breeding quests, but also to retain that species indefinitely. If the mutated trait only appears in one trait, the chance of it carrying is basic cross-breeding and not whatever was required to cause the trait to mutate in the first place. New bee species also have a set of default traits, and the new species will try to manifest these traits. You could start with two species that have compatible climate conditions and wind up with one needing completely different temperature and humidity. You want to encourage traits as you finish breeding the pure bee to get the other traits you want out of it. \n\nUltimately, the species trait determines what the bee produces and everything else is fair game. All traits can be bred into any bee species, aside from the species itself. Species also determines the initial preferred temperature and humidity. Species require their preferred temperature and humidity to be in the \u0027jubilant\u0027 state and produce their special drops. You can also mimic this with the alveary or industrial apiary, but increasing tolerances will NOT work.\n\nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances or lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However, the excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for a pristine princess to become ignoble.\n\nA recommended early-game meta for bee breeding is to find an Oblivion Frame in a Stronghold library, and then a means to keep it repaired like with a Thaumic Restorer. This rapidly speeds up the turnaround time to turn a queen into offspring. You monitor the process manually at an apiary, and use any additional frames you can to improve the mutation rate. You can push this well past the point you can make alvearies, but there are alveary components that can further improve on this.\n\nIt looks complex, because it is! But it\u0027s also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!",
