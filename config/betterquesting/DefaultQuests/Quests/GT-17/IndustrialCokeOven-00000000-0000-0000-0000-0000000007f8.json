With one of these, you can replace several of those, since it does up to 24x parallels.\n\nYou\u0027ll be able to effectively retire the Pyros from now on, unless there\u0027s some very fast recipe that they can keep up with. To turn Wood into Charcoal, for example, this ICO can keep up with an entire farm as long as you provide it enough Nitrogen for the job!\n\n§3This multi is EV and doesn\u0027t actually need the ABS."
