That makes sense, right?\n\nYou need to use H8N4C2O4 (Green) Rocket Fuel to fuel it.\n\n§3If you started on an older version of GTNH and still have some Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine Fuel Mix, you can also use that as rocket fuel! But you can\u0027t make any more of it, so better look into H8N4C2O4 anyway."
