They cannot cleanse Tainted Nodes, nor will they necessarily return tainted biomes back to what they were before, but they will provide a barrier.\n\nThe Shimmerleaf they are made from have a recipe in an LV Assembling Machine if you\u0027re having a hard time finding them around Silverwood trees. There is also an IC2 crop version of them.",
