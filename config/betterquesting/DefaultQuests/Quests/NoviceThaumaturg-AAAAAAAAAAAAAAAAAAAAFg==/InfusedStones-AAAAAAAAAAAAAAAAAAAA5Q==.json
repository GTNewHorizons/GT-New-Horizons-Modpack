You wonder what happens to regular stone if it\u0027s exposed to large amounts of magic for such a long time. Maybe it\u0027s time to go mining?\n\nThere are 3 veins. There\u0027s amber and cinnabar in each. They aren\u0027t super useful, but make sure to keep hold of some at least.\n\nEven when you find these infused stones, they won\u0027t drop the infused shards you desperately need. Rather, you have to process the raw ores themselves. The easiest way to do that is to throw these raw ores in your Forge Hammer.\n\nLater when you have a Sifter, you can sift purified ores for more shards. An autoclave can also turn shard dust into a shard. Maybe there\u0027s a magical way to do the same thing?",
