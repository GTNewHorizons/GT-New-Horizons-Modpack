Well if so; better brace yourself for the Netherite line!\n\nDon\u0027t panic, it\u0027s a relatively straight-forward line so long as you can wrap your head around processing loops. Fortunately you have a quest book to guide you through your initial setup. \n\nAs a forewarning- this line will require you to make a setup in the nether, as well as gather Ancient Debris from the nether so make sure you have made the preparations to do so. No need to \n\n[warn]If you already created the line and do not wish to complete the individual quests, hold either a dense Netherite plate, an Mk1 Fusion Reactor, or 16 Netherite ingots after completing this quest to trigger the skip.[/warn]",
