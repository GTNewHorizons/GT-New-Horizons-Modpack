      "desc:8": "So you have made yourself an Eternal DTPF or hopefully a few, and now it is time for the push to the next tier, UXV.\n\nIntroducing the final multiblock in the game, and by far the most expensive.\nIt introduces 4 new materials: Raw Stellar Plasma, White and Black Dwarf Matter and finally Universium.\n\nIt has 3 different tiered casings with 9 tiers each:\n\nSpacetime Compression Field Generator:\n- Determines the tier of the planet block that can be run and decreases the processing time by 3% per tier.\n\nTime Dilation Field Generator:\n- Decreases recipe time by 50% per tier, while decreasing the chance of a recipe succeeding by 9.25% per tier.\n\nStabilisation Field Generator:\n- Increases the chance of a recipe succeeding by 5% per tier, while decreasing the output of a recipe by 5% per tier.\n\nLower tier Stabilisation Field Generators have a power output penalty.\n\nFinding the best setup of different casing tiers might be a hard task, so a calculator visualing all the drops and setups has been created: [url]https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15j30mNnFIWBhwpJGuDrKTfiHBXNEEqyvB_r7ztFWlyQ[/url]\n\n[note]Be sure to read the tooltip of the Eye of Harmony controller, it explains everything in detail! Depending on your GUI scale it might have multiple pages.[/note]",
