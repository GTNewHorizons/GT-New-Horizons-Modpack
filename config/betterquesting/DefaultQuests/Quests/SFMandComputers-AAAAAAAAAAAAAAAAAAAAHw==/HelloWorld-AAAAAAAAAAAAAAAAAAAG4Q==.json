Type in \u0027install\u0027 and then type \u0027Y\u0027 when asked if you wish to install OpenOS.\n\nWhen finished, remove the disk and toss it on your wall and reboot the computer.\n\nType \u0027df\u0027 to display all present file systems and mount points, you\u0027ll notice one named OpenOS; this is your hard drive\u0027s default name after installing the OS.\n\nLet\u0027s change it with \u0027label -a OpenOS HDD\u0027, \u0027-a\u0027 checks for names starting with what you type after it with that command. [note]\u003c-- part of this is apparently wrong? Thanks for the non-ticket explaining what part, guys.[/note]\n\nNow for fun, let\u0027s make your first program! How about something functional, make a with \u0027edit startup\u0027 this will bring you to an edit page for a new program called startup. Let\u0027s just have it do something simple, \u0027print(\"Hello World!\")\u0027 Like that\u0027ll never get old.\n\nNow press Ctrl+S to save, and Ctrl+W to get out of that screen. Back in your home root let\u0027s now type startup and you\u0027ll see it display \"Hello World!\" neat huh?\n\nLet\u0027s now make startup actually work on startup. Type \u0027edit .shrc\u0027 .shrc is a mystic file that runs shell commands when booting your PC. So in .shrc type \u0027startup\u0027 save and reboot the computer. Now it should say \"Hello World!\" upon starting. Double neat right?",
