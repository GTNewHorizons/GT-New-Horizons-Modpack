These can be removed the normal ways, with milk or terra wart or other methods that imitate them.\n\nThe other effect is a special Radiation unique debuff. This gets applied the longer you hold onto the radioactive item. Severely radioactive items can apply minutes of this deadly debuff. Regeneration might delay the inevitable death, but most regeneration sources aren\u0027t fast enough or long enough to keep you alive. You can try using an Amulet of Remedium to get rid of the effects. You should have one from your Moon trip, if not you\u0027ll have to dive into Thaumcraft to make one.",
