      "desc:8": "Vis bees lead to some of the most powerful bees in the whole pack. They require a node within 75m of the bee housing. Make sure the lunar phase matches the requirements. Breed them from Ethereal and Infernal.\n\n[note]Astronomer\u0027s Notes: The waxing and waning phases happen on alternating days. The moon starts its next phase at sunrise and will keep to the same phase all day and all night. You want to prepare the day before, get to bed to start the next day, and immediately get to work. Also, congratulations if you just learned that the moon in Minecraft has phases!\n\nBreeder\u0027s Notes: Just because this bee only mutates around specific lunar phases doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t work on them in other phases. To get the mutations to show up at all, yes, you need correct lunar phases. However, you will need a spare Infernal or Ethereal princess to get started, and you can prep that any day. Also, once the Vis species trait shows up in some drones and/or a princess, it\u0027s just regular cross-breeding to get a pure princess and pure drone. That can be done any day too.\n\nYou do not need to breed at night to trigger the mutation.\n\nThe Ethereal and Infernal bees are a rough combination. Since you\u0027ll need a new princess for this bee, consider using a pristine princess that isn\u0027t aggressive and is closer to your Ethereal bees\u0027 climate. If you get lucky, you may breed out the aggression and produce hybrid Infernals that don\u0027t need to live in an oven to function. You will probably need your apiarist suit if the bred queen gets a dominant Infernal trait for a few cycles.[/note]",
