      "desc:8": "The (forestry) soldering iron is a tool used for attaching electron tubes to circuit boards in order to manipulate how an electrical engine works or to program multifarms, as well as upgrading the squeezer or centrifuge. Honestly, you\u0027ll probably only use it for the multifarm though.\n\nOnce electron tubes have been attached to a circuit board they cannot be removed, only replaced. The circuit board is automatically crafted as soon as the basic recipe requirements are met, so it\u0027s best practice to first place your electron tubes and then add the circuit board.\n\nThe soldering iron can also be used to remove the circuit board from electrical engines, multifarms, squeezers and centrifuges by opening the machine\u0027s GUI and left-clicking with the soldering iron on the circuit board slot.",
