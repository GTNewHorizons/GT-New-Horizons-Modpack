You can also separate busses with a screwdriver. The PA is usually less efficient than a dedicated multiblock but it is very versatile and allows for TecTech energy hatches and even laser hatches once you get there.\n\n[note]Doesn\u0027t work with some machines, like mass fabs.\n\nJust in case you get that far and still remember it: The PA maxes out at UHV recipes. But UEV machines are treated as 4x UHV machines giving you a lot of parallels.\n\nThere is also a new experimental feature where the PA can handle fluid recipes without cells but using the fluid directly.[/note]"
