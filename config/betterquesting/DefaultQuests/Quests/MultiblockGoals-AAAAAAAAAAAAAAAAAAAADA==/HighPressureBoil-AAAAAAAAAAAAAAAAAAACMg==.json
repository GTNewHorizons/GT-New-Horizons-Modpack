It will take longer to warm up, so make sure to keep it well fed!\n\nExtract steam by attaching a pipe to the boiler tank.\n\nKeep in mind that it consumes many times more fuel to heat up a boiler than to keep it at top temperature.\n\n[note]This is better than the low pressure variant only if you keep it working for very long time, if you intend to turn it on and off all the time this will waste a lot of resources! If you keep it at top temperature it will use ~2x more fuel than low pressure and will give ~4x more steam per sec making it 100% more efficient! If you can\u0027t sustain the fuel drain or want a more flexible power source instead use the low pressure variant.[/note]\n\n[warn]Actual fuel usage depends on the machine size and other factors such as machine temperature, if you want to know the actual number you will need to test it on your own setup.[/warn]"
