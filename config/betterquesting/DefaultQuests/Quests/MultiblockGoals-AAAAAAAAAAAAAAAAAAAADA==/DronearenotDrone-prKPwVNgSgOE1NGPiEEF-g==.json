These new electric friends are great companions for Multiblock machines: maintenance, control, management—they can do it all.\n\n§lThe Drone Centre is a newly designed machine. It doesn\u0027t need power; just put a drone into it and it will start running.\nOnce running, the drone will automatically scan for a \u0027§lDrone Downlink Module§r\u0027 (replacing maintenance hatches on Multiblock machines) within a certain range and attempt to establish a connection with the host. If successful, you can remotely control this Multiblock machine from the Drone Centre GUI! Additionally, you can rename the machine for easier identification.\n\n[note]You can rename it either by right-clicking the Drone Downlink Module or in the Drone Centre GUI.[/note]\n\nPlacing more advanced drones will increase the range of the Drone Centre, with no limit on the amount of drones.\n\n[warn]Notice that drones may crash during operation—the probability decreases from Tier 1 to Tier 3, and Tier 3 Anti-Gravity Drones never crash.\nBesides, If the machine host is too far from the Drone Centre, the GUI remote control function will be disabled, but the turn-on/off-all-button and maintenance functions will still work.[/warn]\n§6§l\nMaybe one day, our drone can control machines on other planets...drive engine online!",
