You can even reuse the old coils in your Pyro or to make other machines, how fancy is that! If you don\u0027t have any other place to use them, you can macerate or arc furnace them too.\n\nIf you dont have a Vacuum Freezer yet coole the hot ingots in a MV Chemical Bath with Coolant.\n\nRemember that you can get an upgraded OC (4/4) instead of a regular one (4/2) if your coils are 1800K above the recipe temperature, as well as a EU discount. This applies to every 900K or 1800K above, so you should try to upgrade your coils as soon as you can."
