The easiest might be just a tank or pipe. This will help until you have access to a Large Heat Exchanger or a Vacuum Freezer.\n\nAn advanced or overclocked reactor vent is much faster than a basic heat vent but you can\u0027t make those yet. Those covers also work with a air in front, but the basic heat vent needs a water block in front. Obviously, all vent covers are faster with water in front than with just air."
