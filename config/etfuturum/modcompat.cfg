    # Disables just the andesite, granite, and diorite full blocks, but leaves their stairs and slabs, etc enabled.

    # Adds compat for Baubles Expanded. Does nothing for standard baubles, this REQUIRES Baubles Expanded! It uses the new "wings" slot added by the expanded version. https://modrinth.com/mod/baubles-expandedWhen enabled, this allows the player to equip an elytra with a chestplate, by placing the elytra in a "wings" slot instead of the chestplate slot. Note that the player can only equip one elytra at a time.0 = No compat, do not allow the elytra to be placed in a wings slot.1 = Elytra will be placeable in a wings slot. Will enable the slot, if it isn't there.2 = The elytra can ONLY go in the wings slots, not the chestplate slot. [range: 0 ~ 2, default: 1]
