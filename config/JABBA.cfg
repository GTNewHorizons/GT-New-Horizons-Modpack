This will allow mods that do not support the DSU to see the full contents of the barrel. *** WARNING *** This will allow mods that do not properly handle inventories to empty out a barrel in one go. Use at your own risk. If you do find such a game breaking mod, please report to that mods' author and ask them to handle inventories better. Otherwise, please enjoy this experimental feature ^_^ [default: false]
